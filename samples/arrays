9440,XML Schema validation for POST requests with ASP.NET WebAPI,"I am trying to find a solution to validate if XML data sent in a POST request are fulfilling a given custom XML schema. If I use the delivered with ASP.NET Web API I don't have a schema validation available, as far as I can see. For example: If I have a model type... ...and a POST action in an ... ...I can post the following ""wrong"" XML data and will get a 200 OK response nevertheless: Or: Or: Or: etc., etc. The only point where I have a validation of the request is model binding: In request example 1, 3 and 4 the passed into the method is , in example 2 the property is which I could invalidate by testing for or by marking the property with a attribute. I could send this validation result back in the response with a 400 ""BadRequest"" Http status code and validation messages in the response body. But I cannot tell exactly what was wrong and can't distinguish between the wrong XML in example 1, 3 and 4 (no has been posted, that's the only thing I can see) - for instance. Requiring that an has to be posted with a specific custom XML schema, for example , I would like to validate if the posted XML is valid with respect to this schema and, if not, send schema validation errors back in the response. To achieve this I have started with a custom : This works so far as long as everything is correct. But I don't know what to do if . How can I ""transfer"" this validation result list to the action or how can I create a Http response that contains those XML schema validation messages?

52978,How to merge features and bug fixes over branches,"Simply put I have the following branch setup: Most developments are done in the DEV branch. When the code is ready to test, everything is merged to the MAIN branch and published to our test environment. When tests are completed, a merge to PROD is done and everything is published to the production server. Every now and then changes (mostly bugfixes) are made on the MAIN or PROD code, but this is an exception. I have been asked to think out a system for feature and bugfix merging. This means that separate changes in the DEV should be merged across MAIN and PROD. With our current setup this information is lost: for example features A, B and C are implemented in the DEV branch. Let's say every feature has two corresponding changesets: A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2. With our current way of working, everything is merged to the MAIN branch in one go. So when we want to ""cherry pick"" features which have to go from MAIN to PROD we can't do this because there's only one changeset on MAIN: the checkin of the merge. How would you fix this? Do I need to change something to my branching strategy? I'm using TFS for source control.",['MAIN\n   |--- DEV\n   |--- PROD\n'],False

406995,Can I use Spring roo in existing project that doesn't use Maven?,"Spring Roo can be use in existing projects that follow standard maven layout. So far this appears to mean that projects that doesn't use maven are out of luck. I am wondering what (if any) are the options for such existing projects. Re-arrange the project layout to conform to Maven layout? This appears to be very difficult path for projects with years of history in CVS due to the fact that method for moving around directories in CVS is extremely invasive. Are there any other options like modifying Maven configuration to work with non-standard layouts? What I recall from my earlier reading about this subject, Maven's CoC approach doesn't favor such non-standard layouts. Edit: Rich's answer below shows that over-riding the defaults in super-pom is trivial. That leaves us with the question whether Spring Roo will play nicely with such modifications. This is doubtful given the fact the Spring Roo doesn't use Maven itself. Edit: Rich's updated answer shows that, by default, ROO will use hard coded paths and will not pick modifications in your pom.xml So answer so far appears to be that it isn't possible out-of-the-box but can be done by some custom coding (or asking ROO team to support this)",[],False

The way I've set it up, I can see without formal calculations that it's maximized when $q=1$. However, I'd like to use the KKT conditions to solve this problem formally and I'm running into problems doing that. First, I set up the Lagrangian to minimize with the KKT conditions: \begin{align} \mathcal{L}(q,\mu,\lambda) &amp; = -K_p(q) - \mu(1-q) - \lambda q \newline \textrm{where} \quad &amp; \mu, \lambda \geq 0 \newline &amp; 0 \leq q \leq 1 \newline &amp; \mu(1-q) = 0 \newline &amp; \lambda q = 0 \end{align} I then set the derivative in terms of $q$ to zero and plug it back in and get the following dual form: \begin{align} D(\mu,\lambda) &amp; = -\mu + \log(1-p+pe^{\mu-\lambda}) \newline &amp; = \log(e^{-\mu}-pe^{-\mu}+pe^{-\lambda}) \end{align} which I'm supposed to maximize. But again, I run into the problem where the maximum of the dual is attained when $\mu,\lambda=0$ (and I got these values again by looking at the equation because setting derivatives to zero was infeasible). Which, according to the KKT conditions, means that q is neither zero nor one. But that can't be right, because the maximum of $K$ is attained when $q=1$. And my obvious question is: what am I doing wrong? And how is this done correctly?",[],False

586408,How does -ms-view-state differ from standard CSS Media Queries Expressions?,"This is part question, and part hope for confirmation. I have my suspicions about the answer to this, and will add my two-cents, but I'd like independent confirmation since the Win8 Forums don't have this particular feature documented very well that I could find. In Windows 8, when building Metro Style Applications using HTML/JS/CSS, the templates all include a series of CSS Media Queries in default.css. They are: @media screen and (-ms-view-state: fullscreen-landscape) {} I'm quite familiar with Media Queries, so my questions are: Why the need for vendor-prefixed expressions in Windows 8, and how do the expressions differ from the W3C standard expressions like width, height and orientation? Here's my take, please add yours below, and confirm, deny or correct me: I suspect that these rules are similar to the standard rules, but are a bit more adaptive, meaning that rather than defining sets of rules that match to a given width and height, these expressions encompass a state in a resolution-agnostic way. Because of this, I can use a single rule for my application in landscape mode and it will work when the app is running at 1366x768, 1920x1080 or 2560x1440. Otherwise, I would have to define these rules three times: @media screen and (width: 1366px) and (height: 768px) {} Assuming my assertion is true, the only gap for me is why I couldn't then just define a single rule using 'min-' and orientation to achieve the same result: @media screen and (min-width: 1366px) and (min-height: 768px) and (orientation: landscape) Single rule, standard expressions. No need for a vendor-prefixed version. What am I missing?","['@media screen and (-ms-view-state: filled) {}', '@media screen and (-ms-view-state: snapped) {}', '@media screen and (-ms-view-state: fullscreen-portrait) {}', '-ms-view-state', '-ms-view-state: fullscreen-landscape', '@media screen and (width: 1920px) and (height: 1080px) {}', '@media screen and (width: 2560px) and (height: 1440px) {}']",False

I created a new feature SPI in VS2010 and manually edited the xml to the following: The elements xml is as follows: The solution deploys successfully and the feature gets activated however the form template is not visible in the 'Manage Form Templates' area of central admin. I can't find any errors in the ULS logs or event logs - it seems to show that the XSNFeatureReceiver has been run with no problems. The form does appear in the FormServerTemplates library correctly. Things I have tried to so far: -Running design checker in InfoPath and verifying that there are no errors or warnings -Creating a new feature and verifying all feature XML is correct -Creating my own FeatureReceiver class that inherits from XSNFeatureReceiver to try and debug (I am not able to step in to the XSNFeatureReceiver code) For your information the form in question is extremely simply - it has a connection to a SQL database using SQL auth and a submit connection - it has no controls on the form.

What we are doing now, have JPA implementation of each Entity, and have an implementation of a generic CRUD interface. Then we expose these beans as JaxWS web services. The problem with this setup is that JaxWS behaves weirdly with generic interfaces. Since this is such a common problem, accessing DB through WS, i would like to know if there is an open source solution, which would expose all the entity tables as web services. Such tool would require as input a set of JPA Classes (or some other data description), or even a JDBC connection (to pull the SQL Schema out) and would produce a set of CRUD web services.

751235,Long communication time when WCF Web Services communicate within the same server,"I am currently developing a system with some WCF Web Services that communicate intensively. At this point I have only one server to test these services. They are running under IIS 6, each service being in a different Application Pool. During the individual evaluation of each Web Service If I individually test each service, I can serve 10000-20000 requests per minute, quickly and without issues for the resource consumption (processor and memory). When I test the whole system or just 2 Web Services I can't serve more than 2000 requests/minute. I also observed that communication time between Web Service is a big issue (sometimes more than 10 seconds). But when testing with only 1000 requests per minute everything goes smoothly (connection time of no more than 60 ms). As a note, I am working with quite big data in some cases and some of the operations needed are long ones. In any of these situations the processor, memory and network aren't an issues (they are used very little). I used perf.mon to see what's going on, for memory, processes, webservice, aspnet, etc. but I didn't see anything that could indicate what it's going wrong. I also tried all the performance settings and tuning options I could find on the Internet. Does someone know what can be wrong? Why the communication between Web Services could last so long? Why the Web Service which serves as an entry point in the system can accept 10000 requests/minute when is tested alone, but when communicating with another Web Service barely accepts 2000? It's an IIS6 problem? Could my system perform better if each Web Service will be deployed on a different server?

It uses MySQL Connector/NET 5.2.7. The way it works is that I grab chunks of data at a time (i.e. 20,000 rows) using SQL_BUFFER_RESULT to avoid locks. Each record is run through the grouper, and then an individual update query is done on that one record. There are two connections used, a read connection and a write connection. So as the program executes and it loops through records from the read query, its using result.Read() to do so, where result is a MySqlDataReader. The result.Read call is where there exception is thrown. It happens randomly (not on the same record or anything). Once it is encountered on the first record, it is also encountered on every subsequent read call for the data reader.

Add a parameter to the current functions, which means that sometimes the user will have to pass null (it's actually 80% of the time). Add an overloading function to every operation that gets 2 parameters (this means adding 6-7 overloading methods to the class) I know both ways work.

We noticed immediately that the little keyboard icon no longer displays when a TextBox receives focus. We solved it by running ""tabtip.exe"" on the MouseDown event for all TextBoxes. We have some numeric textboxes though (quantity for an item on an order), and want to open the on-screen keyboard for numeric entry, but it opens with qwerty keys by default. I have been searching extensively for any command-line arguments I can pass to tabtip.exe to change its input mode, but have had no luck.

However, from a developer pov, where should our design principles be focused? Should we be looking at transitional or strict doctypes? Should we prepare our code for XHTML5? I personally like many of the design principles of xhtml1.1 strict doctype... but I take great exception at the attempts to entirely remove the iframe tag, and to a lesser extent the ability to instruct browsers to open links in new tabs(or windows depending on browser behaviour). I cannot see how iframes could possibly disappear in the near future as they seem such an intrinsic development utility when dealing with googlemaps, youtube videos, etc. etc. Whilst I would still tend to develop sites in the direction on self closing tags) will not validate as HTML5.

My primary ISP gives me around 5x-10x the bandwidth of the secondary, but the disadvantage is that the router's IP is not public so I can't do port forwarding for remote access (I've kind of worked around this with LogMeIn Hamachi but it's painfully slow because of the tunneling involved). Here's the issue, I want to use the secondary NIC (which can be accessed via port forwarding) as a point of entry for remote desktop but to do this I would need the Dyn.com update client to use it to connect to their servers to update my IP.

1430645,Specifying a different font for polytonic Greek in pdfTeX with Babel,"I am writing my master’s thesis with the ulthese class, which is now part of MiKTeX and TeX Live. This class is based on memoir and is fairly flexible, but assumes the use of pdfTeX and sets the font encoding to . Furthermore, the University requires the use of Computer Modern/Latin Modern or a standard PostScript font (e.g. Times or Palatino). My thesis is primarily in French, with citations in English and polytonic Greek. With ’s option, the package, and the package from the bundle my bases seem to be covered. I have decided to use Palatino as the main text font (with the package) and, because this font family does not cover extended greek, the CB Greek fonts are automatically used instead in ’s commands and environments. I have no problem with CB Greek in itself, but it does not blend optimally with Palatino and I would like to use another font’s extended Greek characters. I know that the Type 1 version of Libertine has polytonic Greek (I have checked the files in FontForge), but I do not know how to use Libertine’s glyphs in the appropriate environments. In fact, I have made a test in which I only used Libertine throughout the document instead of Palatino/Mathpazo, but still Libertine’s Greek was not used and the CB fonts were substituted. My question is: how can I automatically switch to another font inside ’s commands and environments on a per-language basis? I am looking for something similar to ’s . I know that the bundle offers a package, but I am not sure whether that is what I need, as I do not yet understand what the package does exactly. If there is no “high-level” solution, will I have to use LaTeX’s font-related commands? If there is no readily available method to use Libertine’s extended Greek, I could be content with Kerkis, which is already set up for automatic use and has many niceties, but I would be very happy if I could use Libertine. What is more, even if I were to use Kerkis for Greek text I would still need to (and want to) use Palatino for the main text, so the switch to Kerkis would have to be confined to Greek environments and commands. Here follows a minimal working example compiled with a fully updated MacTeX 2012 on OS X 10.8, with pdfTeX. Some commands and options in the preamble are specific to and I include them to show the complete use case (for example, I use ’s specific color setup and I use ’s option in order to get polytonic Greek text to display correctly in PDF bookmarks).","['T1', 'inputenc', 'utf8', 'babel', 'textalpha', 'lgrx', 'mathpazo', 'babel', '\\textgreek', '{otherlanguage}{polutonikogreek}', '.pfb', 'babel', 'polyglossia', '\\newfontfamily\\greekfont[Script=Greek,\xe2\x9f\xa8...\xe2\x9f\xa9]{\xe2\x9f\xa8font\xe2\x9f\xa9}', 'lgrx', 'substitutefont', 'ulthese', 'ulthese', 'hypperef', 'hyperref', 'unicode', '\\documentclass[12pt,nonatbib,english,polutonikogreek,francais]{ulthese}\n  \\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}\n  \\usepackage{textalpha}\n  \\usepackage[osf]{mathpazo}\n  \\usepackage{microtype}\n  \\chapterstyle{southall}\n  \\setsecheadstyle{\\Large\\mdseries}\n  \\setsubsecheadstyle{\\large\\mdseries}\n  \\setsubsubsecheadstyle{\\mdseries\\scshape}\n  \\usepackage[unicode]{hyperref}\n  \\hypersetup{colorlinks,allcolors=ULlinkcolor}\n  \\frenchbsetup{%\n    CompactItemize=false,\n    ThinSpaceInFrenchNumbers=true\n  }\n  \\titre{Un m\xc3\xa9moire sur la philosophie grecque}\n  \\auteur{Un \xc3\xa9tudiant en philosophie}\n  \\programme{Ma\xc3\xaetrise en Philosophie}\n  \\annee{9999}\n  \\MA\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\chapter{Introduction \xc3\xa0 la \\textgreek{\xcf\x86\xcf\x8d\xcf\x83\xce\xb9\xcf\x82} et autres}\n\nPour les Grecs, la \\textgreek{\xcf\x86\xcf\x8d\xcf\x83\xce\xb9\xcf\x82} a plusieurs sens.\nD\xe2\x80\x99ailleurs, c\xe2\x80\x99est le cas de plusieurs mots.\n\n\\begin{otherlanguage}{polutonikogreek}\n\xcf\x83\xcf\x8d\xce\xbc\xcf\x88\xce\xb7\xcf\x86\xcf\x8c\xcf\x82 \xcf\x83\xce\xbf\xce\xaf \xce\xb5\xe1\xbc\xb0\xce\xbc\xce\xb9, \xe1\xbc\x94\xcf\x86\xce\xb7, \xcf\x84\xce\xbf\xcf\x8d\xcf\x84\xce\xbf\xcf\x85 \xcf\x84\xce\xbf\xe1\xbf\xa6 \xce\xbd\xcf\x8c\xce\xbc\xce\xbf\xcf\x85, \xce\xba\xce\xb1\xce\xaf \xce\xbc\xce\xbf\xce\xb9 \xe1\xbc\x80\xcf\x81\xce\xad\xcf\x83\xce\xba\xce\xb5\xce\xb9.\n\\end{otherlanguage}\n\n\\end{document}\n']",False

1457263,Saving advanced state of an Android Listview,"I know that Android provides a mechanism to allow developers to save and restore states in an Activity via the following methods: I've seen numerous examples whereby people show how to save simple state (such as the current index in a listview), and many examples where people say that the listview should just be backed by a data model which will allow the list to be restored. However, when things get more complicated and the user interaction more involved, I've been struggling to find out the correct way to save this state. I have a listview which contains custom controls for each row. When clicked a row will expand with animation to show additional details to the user... within the additional details view, the user is also able to change certain things. Now I know that if my Activity is destroyed (or my Fragment replaced), the current state reflecting the UI changes and the user's interaction with the list is now lost. My question is how do I got about correctly saving this detailed state of my listview such that the state of each custom component row is also preserved? Thanks! Edit: Thanks for the replies below. I understand that SharedPreferences can be used to store key-value state, however, I guess I am more interested in the view states.... for instance Android will automatically save/restore the viewstate of an EditText field (i.e. its contents) in my activity , so how do I go about achieving the same thing with more complex custom components in a listview?

1460289,How to implement proper HTTP error handling in .NET MVC 2?,"I've been struggling all day to implement error handling in my ASP.NET MVC 2 app. I've looked at a variety of techniques, but none work properly. I'm using MVC2 and .NET 4.0 (started the project before MVC3 was released; we'll upgrade after we deliver our initial release). At this point, I'll be happy to properly handle 404 and 500 errors -- 403 (authorization required) would be great, too, followed by various other specific responses. Right now, I either get all 404s, all 500s, all 302s before the 404, or all 302s before the 500. Here are my requirements (which should be pretty close to the basic requirements of HTTP): If a resource is not found, throw a 404, and display a 404-specific page with the requested URL. DO NOT return an intermediate response code like 302. Ideally, keep the requested URL, rather than showing a new URL like -- but if the latter displays, be sure we didn't return a redirect response to get it. If an internal server error occurred, throw a 500, and display a 500-specific error with some indication of what went wrong. Again, don't return an intermediate response code, and ideally don't change the URL. Here's what I'd consider a 404: Static file not found: Controller not found: Controller found, but Action not found: Controller and action found, but the action can't find the requested object: Here's what I'd consider a 500: Post a bad value: Non-data-related problem, like a Web Service endpoint not responding Some of these problems need to be identified by specific controllers or models, and then the controllers should throw the appropriate HttpException. The rest should be handled more generically. For 404 case #2, I tried to use a custom ControllerFactory to throw a 404 if the controller can't be found. For 404 case #3, I've tried to use a custom base controller to override and throw a 404. In both cases, I get a 302 before the 404. And, I never get 500 errors; if I modify Web.config to put a typo in my Web Service endpoint, I still get a 302, then a 404 saying the URL (controller/action) which uses the Web Service can't be found. I also get the requested URL as a(n unwanted) querystring param: Both of these techniques came from http://www.niksmit.com/wp/?p=17 (How to get normal 404 (Page not found) error pages using ASP.Net MVC), pointed to from http://richarddingwall.name/2008/08/17/strategies-for-resource-based-404-errors-in-aspnet-mvc/ If in Web.config I have , I get the appropriate response code, but my Error controller never gets called. Taking out the attribute gets me the MVC error views, but with an intervening 302 and a changed URL -- and always the same controller ( = 500; if I change it to everything looks like a 404). Here are some of the other things I've read and tried to implement: http://www.davidjuth.com/asp-net-mvc-error-handler.aspx http://sanjayuttam.com/wordpress/index.php/c-sharp/c-sharp-code-examples/error-handling-in-asp-net-mvc-1-part-2-of-2/ http://blog.hebbink.com/post/2010/12/14/NET-custom-404-error-page-returns-302-for-http-status.aspx http://blog.dantup.com/2009/04/aspnet-mvc-handleerror-attribute-custom.html http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/07/14/asp-net-mvc-preview-4-release-part-1.aspx .. along with a bunch of StackOverflow posts. Seems to me this sort of error handling is pretty basic to Web apps, and the MVC framework ought to have defaults that do this out of the box, and let people extend it to work otherwise. Perhaps they'll do it in a future release.

Here is the loop in which the packets are received: The code of the thread in which the packets are processed: One method called in the above method: One of the runs testing the program: The sender sends more than 512 packets. About the 100 first packets are received by the receiver. After that there is a gap of about 200 packets which are lost. An additional 30 packets are received with sequence numbers close to each other; and then the program terminates. Modifying the code in order to test the behaviour without mutexes, shows that there still are many lost packets. The program receives all packets with the following code: What's the reason of the missing packets and how do I resolve this problem?

When I add the component to the Form both the TFont properties in the Object Inspector are in Bold (non-default). If I click the ellipse next to each published font I can see the values I set from the constructor show up - but again they are in Bold. Oddly enough though, the Size value for each font is never shown in Bold (ie appears unchanged). Standard published properties can be made very easily, but how can you do this with classes like TFont that has sub-properties? I cannot see a way of setting the default values from the class structure, only in the constructor. Even if I could define the default values from the class structure (which seems impossible) I doubt it would work because the font has not been created yet.

1530491,"Need a Ruby way to determine the elements of a matrix ""touching"" another element","I think I need a method called “Touching” (as in contiguous, not emotional.) I need to identify those elements of a matrix that are next to an individual element or set of elements. At least that’s the way I’ve thought of to solve the problem at hand. The matrix State in the program below represents, let’s say, some underwater topography. As I lower the water, eventually the highest point will stick out and become an “island”. When the “water level” is at 34 then the element State[2,3] is the single point of the island. The array atlantis holds the coordinates of that single point . As we lower the water level further, additional points will be “above water.” Additional contiguous points will become part of the island and their coordinates would be added to the array atlantis. (For example, the next piece of land to be part of atlantis would be State[3,4] at 31.) My thought about how to do this is to identify all the matrix elements that touch/are next to the element in the atlantis, find the one with the highest elevation and then add it to the array atlantis. Looking for the elements next to a single element is a challenge in itself, but we could write some code to examine the set [i,j-1], [i,j+1], [i-1,j-1], [i-1,j], [i-1,j+1], [i+1,j-1], [i+1,J], [i+1,j+1]. (I think I got that right.) But as we add additional points, the task of determining which points surround the points in atlantis becomes increasingly difficult. So that’s my question: can anyone think of any mechanism by which to do this? Any kind of simplified algorithm using capabilities of ruby of which I am unaware? (which include all but the most basic.) If such a method could be written then I could write atlantis.touching and get an array, for example, containing all the coordinates of all the points presently contiguous to atlantis. At least that’s how I’m thinking this could be done. Any other ideas would be welcome. And if anyone knows any kind of partnering site where I could seek others who might be interested in working with me on this, that would be great.","['# create State database using matrix\nrequire \'matrix\'\n\nState=Matrix[ [3,1,4,4,6,2,8,12,8,2],\n              [6,2,4,13,25,21,11,22,9,3,],\n              [6,20,27,34,22,14,12,11,2,5],\n              [6,28,17,23,31,18,11,9,18,12],\n              [9,18,11,13,8,9,10,14,24,11],\n              [3,9,7,16,9,12,28,24,29,21],\n              [5,8,4,7,17,14,19,30,33,4],\n              [7,17,23,9,5,9,22,21,12,21,],\n              [7,14,25,22,16,10,19,15,12,11],\n              [5,16,7,3,6,3,9,8,1,5] ]\n\n#find sate elements contiguous to island\natlantis=[[2,3]]\n\nfind all state[i,j] ""touching"" atlantis\n']",False

1549110,Showing bijection in proving composition of two automorphisms is an automorphism,"To show a composition of two maps, $f, g$ is an automorphism I need to show they are bijective and homomorphism. The homomorphism part is easy: If we have $f, g: G \rightarrow G$, then for some element $a,b \in G$ we get $$ f \circ g (ab) = f(g(ab)) = f(g(a)g(b))$$ as $g4$ is an isomorphism. Then as $f$ is an isomorphism, we also get $$f(g(ab)) = f \circ g(a) f \circ g(b)$$ I'm pretty sure that's correct. Now to prove for bijection, I first thought about checking to see if the kernel was trivial as that would show injection, $g(a,b) = (0,0)$ iff $a = b = 0$. So putting this in the composition gives us $f \circ g(0,0) = f(g(0,0)) = f(0,0) = (0,0)$, hence the map is injective. We see from the definition of the map that every element in it maps to some element in $G$ and so the map is also surjective and therefore bijective. Is that correct?",[],False

What i have done is i use virtuall layout on both lists for performance reasons and the second lists height is a 100%, so the second scroller never appears. I have tried to disable the second scroller of the second lists with ""this.scroller.setStyle('verticalScrollPolicy', 'off')"". But nothing happens. What i want is a normal scrolling behaviour, means that it shouldnt matter where in the ""wordview"" the mouse is i want to scroll like it is one list and not 2 lists.

1661523,Design approach on a program with many GUI screens,"I've terribly confused myself to the point of no return and feel my project is ballooning too huge to keep up with my current ways. In a nutshell: 1) There are many graphical screens (windows), each screen is a class defined in its own .cpp with a accompanying .h header w/ public &amp; private decelerations. 2) I'm using the FLTK GUI toolkit, so when I leave a screen I call ""hide()"" on it, which I assume does garbage collection, and then I create a new instance of whatever screen is to follow. My issue is that if a screen (Screen A lets call it) creates another screen (Screen B), then I must include screen B's header file in Screen A, and I make a global pointer to Screen B in Screen A's .cpp. ie. A pseuodocode for Screen A Is this the best approach? I feel it's sloppy (and a memory leak?) and I should have something like a dummy .cpp/.h that keeps track of a bunch of extern-qualified pointers; especially as sometimes I must go back/forward screens (i.e. Can jump back to a Main Menu screen from a miltiple other screens).

1711102,jump out of a JS variable encapsulation,"I'm reading a boook on XSS attacks, and I've found an example about XSS filter evasion that is a little weird (IMHO). This is the example text: Another possible injection point that could exist is when the developer uses unsanitized user input as part of the generated HTML within a script element. For example: &lt;script&gt; var query_string=""&lt;XSS&gt;""; somefunction(query_string); function somefunction { ... } &lt;/script&gt; It appears we have access to the inside of the JavaScript function. Let’s try adding some quotes and see if we can jump out of the encapsulation: &lt;script&gt; var query_string=""”&lt;XSS&gt;""; somefunction(query_string); function somefunction { ... } &lt;script&gt; It worked, and also caused a JavaScript error in the process as shown in Figure 3.38. Let’s try one more time, but instead of trying to inject HTML, let’s use straight JavaScript. Because we are in a script tag anyway, why not use it to our advantage? &lt;script&gt; var query_string=""”;alert(“XSS”);//""; somefunction(query_string); function somefunction { ... } &lt;/script&gt; the bold text is what I suppose to be the user input, taken for example from a form. Back to my question: is there any way that this kind of attack works? For example, suppose is used to run some sql query, and is a product name to search within the database. If inside the search function I create , I think there's no way to inject some string with quotes to ""jump out of the encapsulation"", i.e inputting will not change the JS to this: Am I wrong? What do you think? Can you make me a simple example (if it possible) on how this kind of attack can make some sort of damages? I thought about something like an online shop, but assuming the JS is not used on server side, the only thing this attack can do is modify the query string and then submit it to the server..

1834255,Should I use LINQ for this query?,"I've been reading a fair bit about the performance of using LINQ rather than using a for each loop and from what I understand using a LINQ query would be a little bit slower but generally worth it for convenience and expressiveness. However I am a bit confused about how much slower it is if you were to use the results of the query in a for loop. Let's say that I have a set called 'Locations' and a set of objects called 'Items'. Each 'item' can only belong to one 'location'. I want to link items that are under the same location to each other. If I were to do this using a normal 'For Each' loop it would be something like this: However if i was to use LINQ it would instead be this: Now my question is, is the second (LINQ) option going to loop once through the entire 'Items' set to complete the query, then loop through the results to add them to the list, resulting in essentially two loops, or will it do the one loop like the first (For Each) option? If the answer is the former, I assume then that it would be silly to use LINQ in this situation.","['For Each it as Item in Items\n   If it.Location.equals(Me.Location)\n      Me.LinkedItems.Add(it)\n   End If\nNext\n', 'For Each it as Item in Items.Where(Function(i) i.Location.equals(Me.Location))\n   Me.LinkedItems.Add(it)\nNext\n']",False

The views that display the data all have a pointer to appDelegate so that they can query the model for the required data. They then call methods in the appDelegate in response to user selections. My question is, doesn't the MVC pattern optimally hide the data from the view? Would it be best practice for the appDelegate (in this case serving as model and controller) to supply the data to the view, and for the view to simply send a notification when there is user input? That would eliminate the need for the view to maintain a pointer to the appDelegate.",[],False

1977277,Is it a good practice to perform direct database access in the code-behind of an ASP.NET page?,I am an experienced developer but I am new to web application development. Now I am in charge of developing a new web application and I could really use some input from experienced web developers out there. I'd like to understand exactly what experienced web developers do in the code-behind pages. At first I thought it was best to have a rule that all the database access and business logic should be performed in classes external to the code-behind pages. My thought was that only logic necessary for the web form would be performed in the code-behind. I still think that all the business logic should be performed in other classes but I'm beginning to think it would be alright if the code-behind had access to the database to query it directly rather than having to call other classes to receive a dataset or collection back. Any input would be appreciated.,[],False

However, I kept noticing that my write performance is always best with the pre-installed FAT32 from Kingston. If I reformat the card with FAT32, the performance still suffers. After browsing wikipedia, I stumbled upon the following comment saying that some cards are optimized for specific cluster sizes. In my case, the Kingston comes pre-formatted for an 64kB cluster size. Risks of reformatting Reformatting an SD card with a different file system, or even with the same one, may make the card slower, or shorten its lifespan. Some cards use wear leveling, in which frequently modified blocks are mapped to different portions of memory at different times, and some wear-leveling algorithms are designed for the access patterns typical of the file allocation table on a FAT16 or FAT32 device.[60] In addition, the preformatted file system may use a cluster size that matches the erase region of the physical memory on the card; reformatting may change the cluster size and make writes less efficient.",[],False

2243555,Change the HTML output of comments,"I'd like to customize the HTML output of the comment form. I've been reading I've been reading how to alter some variables of the comment_form(). The previous link provides a rather good guide to play with that function. But I'm still unable to change the HTML output of the form. And I would like to wrap some fields inside a container. With older wordpress versions this could be changed at will in the comments.php function, but doing it that way will break nested comments, so it is not an option.

2310284,SQL Server - Any better alternative to improve performance of a lengthy transaction with lot of inserts?,"I have a scenario where a user action on screen results in new records getting created in about 50 different tables, real-time. The design of the use case is such that the new records that are created as a result of a user action - is required immediately for the user to make changes. So no possibility of offline or delayed creation. Having said that, the obvious problem is - the insertion statements (along with some additional manipulation statements) are inside a transaction, which makes it a really lengthy transaction. This runs for about 30 seconds and often results in timeout or blocks other queries. Transaction is required for atomicity. Is there a better way I can split the transaction and still retain the consistency? Or any other ways to improve upon the current situation?",[],False

We don't want it to do that because it makes the commits noisier than it needs to be. This in turn complicates merges. Part of the problem is that we're transitioning from Eclipse to IntelliJ - which has generally been a big improvement - and we're still getting our code style sorted out. So there are some inconsistencies in the format actually present in a particular file. A problem, which to some degree pre-dates our migration. We are working on getting a standard format published, which will help. But we don't need the merge conflicts. This is out of character for IntelliJ.

2403252,jQuery AutoComplete combobox issue on IE7/8,"I want to use jQuery AutoComplete on a web page. The page is embedded inside an IE Control in an application. The problem is that in IE7 and 8, the control does not render properly, as seen in the pic below. The top part of the pic is how jQuery's example page loads in Firefox (it looks similar in Chrome and IE9) and the bottom part shows how it renders in IE7/8. I've circled the issue in red - the dropdown arrow does not align correctly with the rest of the control. If I'm not mistaken Windows Web Browser control is stuck in IE7 rendering mode, unless you modify certain registry settings which is not feasible for us. I've confirmed that the issue persists on my machine if I view the AutoComplete Combobox in via a WebBrowser Control even though I've got IE9 installed. Is there any easy way to fix the alignment via javascript/css? The closest I've gotten to a fix is adjusting height using css, but I still can't get the top of the element to align correctly. Alternatively, does anyone have a solution for a free autocomplete combobox with jsQuery's that doesn't require theming and/or renders properly in IE7/8? Another minor issue with on IE7/8 is that the tooltips don't appear in the correct positions, but this not not a big problem as tooltips will be removed for this application.

2423800,Change selected tab from ViewModel And send objects between ViewModels,"I got a wpf desktop application with 3 ViewModels. I have 1 ViewModel that contains a tabhost and tabs. And I got 2 tabs. Each of those tabs has it's own ViewModel. The problem I have is that in tab1 I have a listview with searchresults and a button. When I select one item in that list and press the button, I want to change tab and display information about that item I selected in tab2. I have searched for a solution, but it seems to include creating all ViewModels in the MainViewModel and providing a reference of the MainViewModel to all the subViewModels. Is there no other way? EDIT I just managed to solve my problems with MVVM light that I added to the project. By binding a method in the MainViewModel and a property in it to the .xaml I can now call it from tab1 with info to tell it to change tab. Also, by binding a method in tab2 I can now send over an item from tab1 in the same manner. This is how I solved it after importing MVVM light into the project. In tab1 In Main/tab2 It seems to automagically just work.. P.s. Thanx for reply. I shall look into how Prism work as well, and see if there is any advantages to use that instead of MVVM light(Not right now however).","['Messenger.Default.Send&lt;string, tab2ViewModel&gt;(--object to send to tab2--);\nMessenger.Default.Send&lt;int, MainViewModel&gt;(--tab index--);\n', 'Messenger.Default.Register&lt;int&gt;(this, ChangeTab);\npublic void ChangeTab(int i)\n{\n   SelectedTabIndex = i; //Bound property in .xaml\n}\n']",False

2442142,Delphi - Declaring in class or not?,"Just recently, probably because I've been maintaining some old code, I've started to look at how / why I do things. As you do. Most of my Delphi programming has been picked up in house, or from examples scattered across the web or manuals. And in some things are done just because ""that's how I do it"" What I'm currently wondering about is Declaration, of variables, procedures, functions, etc. When I am working with a form, I will place all my procedures and functions under public or private. Whilst I will try to avoid global vars and constants will generally go under var or const, either in the interface or implementation, depending on where they need to be called (occasionally though they will go in public / private) Otherwise, if its just a unit I will declare the procedure in the interface and use in the implementation. Some of the code I've been maintaining recently has no interface declaration but instead has everything properly ordered with calls after procedures... Is there a correct way to do this? Are there rules of what should / should not go in the class? Or is it a style / when you started thing? Edit to add My question is not about whether a declaration of a procedure goes in private/public but whether all declarations in a TForm Unit should go in one of these. Similarly should var / const be in one or the other? Further clarification I understand that not declaring in interface, or declaring in public/private/etc affects the visibility of procedures/functions to other units in my applicaiton. The core of my question is why would i not want to declare? - especially when working in a form/unit when placing in private is much more explicit that the thing declared is not available to other units...

In my spare time I've been playing with a web service at work, this has basically been starting off with doing something with the data, then doing something else. So first I just returned a list of drug names. OK, let's add a count of the returned results. OK, let's populate the individual drug details in a modal. OK, let's edit a drug name. No real rhyme or reason, just coming up with stuff and playing around with KO. I'm at the point where I'm not sure how to really manage my data so it gets updated everywhere. I've made a screenshot that walks you through what I have and illustrates the problem. http://i.imgur.com/5qNWQ.jpg Get my search results by clicking on the ""y"" button. I then select the ""Yasmin 28"" drug I get the detail view for that drug in a modal window I edit the drug name and click the ""save"" button The drug name is updated in the modal window I ""cheat"" and update the drug name in the search results by just crawling that part of the DOM and replacing the old drug name with the new drug name. Problem with this is, it isn't taking advantage of the observable nature of KO...If I were to close the modal and click on the ""Yasmin 28"" drug link again, the modal would show ""Yasmin 28"" not what I just changed it to (""something wonderful""). I'm not quite sure how to track if a property changes in my observableArray.

2590815,Mobile Firefox (Fennec) add-on: executing code on page loads,"I am trying to write a mobile firefox plugin that executes a piece of javascript code automatically every time a page loads. I had written some code for an earlier version of Fennec, but with the multi-processing system in the newer Fennec version (https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Fennec/Extensions/Electrolysis/), this code had to be ported. I based myself on a tutorial from http://people.mozilla.com/~mfinkle/tutorials/ to get a version working that executes a piece of code whenever an option is selected in the browser menu. This solution consists of two parts, namely overlay.js (for the main (application) process) and content.js (for the child (content) process). Overlay.js is loaded in overlay.xul, while content.js is loaded for new tabs via the following code in overlay.js: The code in overlay.js sends a message to content.js whenever the option in the browser menu is clicked, and the required code is then correctly executed (some script tags are simply added to the head of the page). However, I don't know how to execute code automatically on a page load. I tried the following in content.js: The last statement however has no effect. Then, I tried adding the following statement at the end: This statement sends a message to the overlay.js script, which registers a listener for this message and in response simply sends the same message as when the option in the browser menu is clicked, i.e., ""coin:addCoin"". However, this didn't work either. Finally, I tried looking for certain events the overlay.js script could listen for (something like ""tabOpened"" or something), but couldn't find anything. Does anyone have any ideas on how to automatically execute code on every page load? Regards, William","['window.messageManager.loadFrameScript(""chrome://coin/content/content.js"", true);\n', 'function addCoin(aMessage) { ... }\n\n// this executes the desired code every time an option is clicked in the browser menu\naddMessageListener(""coin:addCoin"", addCoin);\n\n// this attempts to execute the code on every page load; i.e., after this script has     \nbeen loaded for the new tab\naddCoin(null);\n', 'sendAsyncMessage(""coin:scriptLoaded"", { });\n']",False

The information to be added comes from a csv file which I do not control (but which is trusted&mdash;it comes from a different part of our company). For each record in the file, I need to either add it (if it does not exist) or do nothing (if it exists). Adding a record consists of the usual , but before that can run for a particular entry a specific must be run. Let's say for the sake of concreteness that the file has 10,000 entries, but 90% of them are already in the database. What is the most efficient way to import the records? I can see a few obvious approaches: Pull all records of this type from the database, then check each of the entries from the file for membership. Downside: lots of data transfer, possibly enough to time the server out. Read in the entries from the file and send a query for just those records with an query (or a query, but that seems even worse). Downside: huge query, probably enough to choke the server. Read in the file, send a query for each entry, then add it if appropriate. Downside: tens of thousands of queries, very slow. Apart from the requirement, this seems like a fairly standard issue that presumably has a standard solution. If there is, it can probably be adapted to my case with appropriate use of tests on the primary key.","['INSERT INTO', 'UPDATE', ""RLIKE 'foo|bar|baz|...'"", ""stuff = 'foo' || stuff = 'bar' || ..."", 'UPDATE', 'auto_increment']",False

The number of users will initially be small, but hopefully will grow. This is why the system needs to be scalable. Presumably for a just a few thousand users you wouldn’t need a cc1.4xlarge EC2 instance? (Otherwise this is going to be very expensive to run!) I plan on using a MySQL database hosted in Amazon RDS for the XMPP server database. I also plan on creating an external XMPP component written in Python, using SleekXMPP. It will be this external component that does all the ‘work’ of the server, as the application I’m making is quite different from instant messaging. For this part I have not worked out how to connect an external XMPP component written in Python to a Tigase server. The documentation seems to suggest that components are written specifically for Tigase - and not for a general XMPP server, using XEP-0114: Jabber Component Protocol, as I expected.

Today I was playing around with X11 forwarding to access applications running on my home PC. I played around and eventually got the X11 forwarding to work. Xclock launched, open office worked. Everything seemed hunky doory. Then I thought to myself... I wonder if its possible for me to access all my mp3's and have the audio streamed to my work PC. I could save myself from the chore of copying files to cds/usb keys/whatever. However, it seems though that no matter what media player I choose, audio is not forwarded. My first attempt was with rhythmbox. I launched the app and noticed the app would load and display correctly but no audio was forwarded. It would show that playback was occuring but I would not hear any audio. I assume it must have been playing out of my speakers at home (and probably was making my dog nuerotic). I thought this may have been a rhythmbox issue, however other apps also failed. Does X11 only forward the video/GUI components and not audio?",[],False

2704936,"Optimal population size, mutate rate and mate rate in genetic algorithm","I have written a game playing program for a competition, which relies on some 16 floating point ""constants"". Changing a constant can and will have dramatic impact on playing style and success rate. I have also written a simple genetic algorithm to generate the optimal values for the constants. However the algorithm does not generate ""optimal"" constants. The likely reasons: The algorithm has errors (for the time being rule this out!) The population is to small The mutate rate is to high The mate rate could be better The algorithm goes like this: First the initial population is created Initial constants for each member are assigned (based on my bias multiplied with a random factor between 0.75 and 1.25) For each generation members of the population are paired for a game match The winner is cloned twice, if draw both are cloned once The cloning mutates one gene if random() is less than mutate rate Mutation multiplies a random constant with a random factor between 0.75 and 1.25 At fixed intervals, dependent on mate rate, the members are paired and genes are mixed My current settings: Population: 40 (to low) Mutate rate 0.10 (10%) Mate rate 0.20 (every 5 generations) What would be better values for population size, mutate rate and mate rate?

2732470,Emacs: help me understand file/buffer management,"I've been using emacs for all of my text editing needs for the past three years now. When I'm in a single file, working on code or whatnot, I'm fairly efficient. With two files, I can ""C-x b RET"" between them and I do fine. However, whenever I need to be working on more than two files at a time, I tend to get lost. Here are some of the problems that I'd like to work on: I forget what some of my buffers are called, but I don't understand why C-x C-b splits my window into two buffers and exits the mini buffer. Sure I can switch buffers and choose a buffer to visit, but this feels unintuitive, and leaves me with two buffers open. When I visit a directory rather than a file, I have a convenient list of all of the files and directories. I usually want to do one of two things with this: 1) Open a single file and never see this buffer again OR 2) Open a bunch of files and never see this buffer again. I don't really know how to do this, as moving the point to a file and hitting return doesn't do either of these things. I know that my buffers aren't like tabs, but I have an inclination to want to scroll through them to find what I want. I don't know of any key-bindings for this, but I'd like it to be M-n / M-p or the like. Then again, this may be a horribly inefficient way to switch buffers. When I open interactive help of any kind (for example in ESS), I have a habit of switching back to the buffer I was working in and using C-x 1 to get back to a single buffer. When I do this, however, the help buffer hangs around in my buffer list, further confusing me. I know I can switch to that buffer, kill it, switch back, and then go back to a single buffer, but this seems wrong. The way I've dealt with this so far involves using a tiling window manager and a few emacs windows in different work-spaces, rather than actually learn the best way to manage a number of files in emacs. I don't necessarily want to change emacs to better fit my needs (although I am open to that if it fits in with what I'm about to say), instead, I'd like to grok the thought process behind handling files/buffers the way that emacs does, and how I can be more efficient with it. Any answer that would help me understand the correct way, or a more efficient way to manage my buffers or files would be greatly appreciated.",[],False

So first it wasn't rendering so I created custom field to test and the template renders it if it's just a text area, text field, boolen or whatever.

Basically I have which has This post type supports editor. single-post.php and other templates display everything correctly. Any ideas? UPDATE (workaround): So I didn't find any proper solution for this problem, that's why I had to come up with a workaround.

In CSS I styled this content div the same way as paragraph, and got the same final look in the template.

What I want is for them to wrap around the box (like normal text) and then, if they go to many lines down for the box to contain them, a scroll to apear on the edge of the box. Like when is set. I know the last part is somewhat awkward a solution, but the boxes must stay the same size. For some information, the tag is the one that contains the box. It is sometimes pared with the tag in css.

Occasionally a user will start receiving 324 errors for a particular URL that had worked for them minutes before. (324 = NO DATA RECEIVED in Chrome, SERVER CLOSED THE CONNECTION in IE8).

I can see the request reaching the machine on which Play Framework is running (via Wireshark), but the request does not seem to reach the Play controller. (debug and trace messages as first step in controller do not get output to log). I have seen the problem occur for two different controllers, it may affect more. Clearing browser cache, history, rebooting client, restarting Play, rebooting server all seem to make no difference. Other browsers can visit the 'broken' URL successfully. The 'broken' clients can visit other URLs in the same application. Does anybody know: 1) Know why this might be happening, or have seen the same problem, or 2) Anybody know where in the response chain Play might bomb out or send a 324? 2) How I can trace more deeply into what is going wrong (e.g. Can I trace Netty access?)

3060677,Performing bitwise operations on large bit strings in MySQL?,"I've got a MySQL database with a large amount of 2048-bit binary strings (e.g '0111001...0101'). One calculation I'll need is the Hamming Distance (the total count of 1's in the XOR'd result) of these strings compared to some externally generated bitstring. In order to get an idea of how to write this query, I tried writing it for smaller bitstrings. Here's an example: The inner portion that computes the XOR works correctly, but BIT_COUNT returns strange results. This example returns 14, which is longer than the string itself. So I have a few questions: First, why is BIT_COUNT returning such strange results. Is it operating on a string rather than the binary string I'd like it to operate on? If so, how do I deal with this? Second, notice that I'm casting (is that the right word here?) the strings as binary by prepending with a b. How would I do this with column names and variables? Clearly I can't simply prepend a b to a variable name, and I can't insert a space between. Any ideas? Thanks, EDIT: So here's a solution to the first problem: There seems to be a problem when using this for larger strings (2048 bits). I tried: and it gives me results like 28, when the actual bitcount should be around 1024. If I remove the b, then it appears to max-out at 64.

3236512,What to use instead of Polymorphic Associations?,"So for a number of reasons Polymorphic Associations are considered bad database design, e.g. you can't have foreign keys on the polymorphic id columns so referential integrity is gone. And, STI is also considered bad unless the sub-types only differ on behavior. So my question is for Rails / ActiveRecord what is the lesser evil in the following scenario: I need to allow my users to create a hand-ordered collection of multiple types of entities. Using Polymorphic Associations the schema would look something like this: I could use STI and have something like this: But, because my artworks differ on data (and not just behavior), I now have NULLs all over the artworks table. I've also introduced an inheritance hierarchy to my objects which previously wasn't there and I am generally wary of, particularly when its only purpose is to serve the database design. STI does seem like it would at least be simpler to query and code for. So which is the lesser evil? Then, the other option is multi-table inheritance: This would get rid of STI's NULL problem and also keep the table sizes down. We still have object hierarchy that I don't think is strictly necessary. But the biggest problem in my eyes: Rails doesn't support it. The CITIER gem looks very nice and it has recent commits but it is not that widely used so I am cautious of using it in my app's foundation. I guess I could also look at using Sequel or another ORM that has CTI support. Truth be told I think I like the multi-table inheritance solution the best If I didn't need the position column I would simply use separate join tables like , , , etc. but I do need that manual ordering. So, it seems the options are: PA: loss of referential integrity (does it matter in practice if always using ActiveRecord for database access?) STI: big table with lots of nulls CTI/MTI: relying on a gem that isn't widely used Which is the lesser evil and are there any other options?

I want to know the relationship between debug/release mode and static linking and symbol informations.... thank you in advance","['#include ""stdafx.h""\n\nint _tmain(int argc, _TCHAR* argv[])\n{\n    printf(""hello\\n"");\n    return 0;\n}\n']",False

3322248,Why is find exec grep > file an Infinite Loop?,"I was trying to collect all of the Message-ID: headers (lines) in a directory with 200K .eml (plain text) files. A bit naively, I said: I let it run overnight, since I figured it would take a while to grep through that many files. A bit to my surprise this morning, messageids.txt is 1.7TB and my partition is full. I realize that what must have happened is that grep's own output is being picked up as input, but I wouldn't (and still don't, intuitively) expect it to repeat endlessly. Which means that my understanding of the forces at play isn't as strong as it should be. Can anyone provide a detailed explanation of how the command above works and why this infinite loop should (I assume) be expected? Thanks. Update: The way I'd expect it to work is that find finds a list of files, and on each one of them grep is called. So at some point grep is called on messageids.txt. If I were to do this on, say, a sort command, messageids.txt would be created as soon as the command executes (possibly whacking it, if it already existed), but it wouldn't be populated until the command completes. In this case, for the loop to be infinite, the file must be getting populated before the output is complete, but in such a way that the input from grep is perpetually keeping up on it. That's the bit that doesn't behave like I'd expect, and I was hoping for a detailed explanation of how this process chain is executing so I can firm up my Linux fundamentals.","['find -type f -exec grep -Fi ""message-id:"" {} \\; &gt; messageids.txt\n']",False
3326630,Loading a view into a UIScrollView AND getting the content inside to work,"I have a tab based application I am working on. I have a view controller named DetailsView.m, with an accompanying nib file called DetailsView.xib. This has a couple of UILabels in, which are linked using IBOutlet to DetailsView.m view controller. When I load this view controller/view using the tab bar controller, it works fine and the UILabels are populated dynamically. Now I want to load this entire view inside a UIScrollView instead so I can fit more content in. So I created another view controller called DetailsHolder.m with a nib file called DetailsHolder.xib, and assigned this to the tab bar controller. I wrote this code below to load the first view (DetailsView) into the UIScrollView in the second view (DetailsHolder). I wrote it in the viewDidLoad method of DetailsHolder: This correctly loads the sub view into the UIScrollView, however, the labels inside DetailsView no longer do anything. When I put an NSLog inside viewDidLoad of DetailsView - it never logs anything. It's as if I've loaded the nib ok, but its no longer associated with the view controller anymore.

One array will handle a list of names, and the other two are for hours worked and hourly pay rate, respectively. I will use the latter two to calculate a set of earnings and output the whole thing to another text file as a report. My problem, however, is with acquiring input for the first array. The input file I'm using has text arranged like this: J. Doe* 35 12.50 J. Dawn* 20 10.00 ......... The names are trailed by asterisks since I'm trying to use ifstream getline to acquire the names with the asterisks acting as delimiters, and writing the following two numbers into the other two arrays. The latter two values are separated by whitespaces, so I don't think they'll cause any problems. I'm sure there are other errors that need handling but I need to work through the first error before I can start debugging the rest. ::getline(_Elem *,std::streamsize,_Elem)' : cannot convert parameter 1 from 'std::string' to 'char *'. From what I've read elsewhere, (I think) the problem stems from trying to write a string to a char array, which won't work since they are of different data types. I'm not sure if other feasible methods exist for acquiring the names since I need the delimiter to separate the names from the numerical values. Any advice on how to resolve this issue would be much appreciated. Here is the source I've written: I've included the entire program to give you an idea of where I plan to go with the coding.

My intent here is not to start a debate, rather I am considering implementing a minimal LISP and I want to understand how minimal I can go while still allowing the language I implement to be Turing complete, etc. If this turns out to be controversial I am sure I will learn what I wanted to learn from observing the controversy. :).

3588415,Issue with overlapping divs in CSS,"I'm working on a website right now that uses an image for navigation; you click on different components of the image, and they act as links to other pages. I looked at a tutorial that explained how to use 3 separate divs to get the effect I'm aiming for; a div that holds the main picture, an overlapping div that uses relative positioning, and a div that has the link image using absolute positioning. So far this method works pretty well for me and gives me the effect I want, but there's one small issue. In my browser I always get extra space leftover on the right side of the page. This issue is kinda hard for me to put into words, so I have an image of how the stacked divs appear in Dreamweaver and the issue as it appears in my browser. You can look at the two garage doors in the first image and see the issue. The garage door on the far right appears properly in the web browser, perfectly overlaying the garage door on the left. However, as you can see in Dreamweaver, it sticks out past the background image and that extra blank space appears in the browser. Here's the code below.

3681672,Brushing to select nodes on a fixed d3 force-directed graph with panning,"I'd like to use D3 to create a force-directed graph with fixed draggable nodes after converging that also has panning and zooming and selecting nodes features. In addition, I'd like the graph to have a brushing feature that can be used to select a group of nodes and drag the selection on the canvas. So far I've the fixed nodes, zooming and panning in place (and tooltips created with qtip). The problem is that even though there's an example of how brushing could be implemented, it would interfere with panning. How can I modify the example I have so that it works with both panning and brushing: can panning for example be delayed for a half a second so mousedown would not interfere with brushing? Are there any proper examples that would illustrate the co-existance of panning and brushing with selection of group of nodes?

3686749,Is there a faster way to process arrays in java android?,"I have a bitmap which i am loading each pixel to array. Later i run through each array pixel data and check if the color is RED and change it to BLACK. So if it is a 1024x1024 image, i have to go through a array of 1048576 length.

3798550,Debugging Simple Graph Algorithm using Breadth First Search (BFS),"I am building a program to search for, identify, and mark the location of a graph of integer values in a simple two-dimensional array. I hand traced the first example and it appeared to work out accurately. With that said I either wrote code that doesn't do what I think it does or my hand tracing was inaccurate. I think my code is close and I'm looking for some debugging assistance and any thoughts on general style, etc. Eventually this algorithm will be modified to find graphs of the pixels of characters for OCR. I simply want to prove that my algorithm implementation is accurate prior to complicating things with the code for processing images. The input array might look like this: and the expected outcome is this: another similar possibility is: in: out: Basic rules: The array size of the input file must match the GS defined in the .cpp file (H equals W equals GS). A graph is defined as one or more ""1"" values adjacent to each other. The search is performed using a basic BFS technique using a simple queue. When a graph is located its values will be updated from ""1"" to ""2"". When the final value in the graph is determined a bounding box of ""3"" values will be drawn around the graph. The smallest X of the box equals the smallest X of the graph minus two, the smallest Y of the box equals the smallest Y of the graph minus two. The largest X of the box equals the largest X of the graph plus two, the largest Y of the box equals the largest Y of the graph plus two. Assume all graphs have a buffer of at least two rows/columns from the border to allow a box to be drawn. The latest attempt of processing this array: yields this output: while a single digit graph works well: yields output: Here is my code:","['0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n', '3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 0 0 0 0 3\n3 0 2 2 0 3\n3 0 2 2 0 3\n3 0 0 0 0 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n', '0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n', '0 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 2 2 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 2 2 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 3 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 3 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0\n', '0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n', '0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 3 0\n0 3 3 2 1 3 3 0\n0 3 3 2 2 3 3 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 3 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n', '0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n', '3 3 3 3 3\n3 0 0 0 3\n3 0 2 0 3\n3 0 0 0 3\n3 3 3 3 3\n', '#include &lt;iostream&gt;\n#include &lt;fstream&gt;\n#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;\n#include ""queue.h""\n\n#define GS 8 /* GRID SIZE */\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nvoid processCmdArgs (ifstream&amp; input, int argc, char* argv[]);\nvoid drawBoundingBox (int arr[][GS], int xLo, int yLo, int xHi, int yHi);\nvoid checkNeighbors (int arr[][GS], bool vis[][GS], queue Q, point* p);\nvoid print (int arr[][GS]);\n\nint main( int argc, char* argv[] ) {\n\n    int xLo = 0;\n    int xHi = GS - 1;\n    int yLo = 0;\n    int yHi = GS - 1;\n    ifstream input; /* filestream to read in file to parse */\n    int arr[GS][GS]; /* declare array of vals to check for graph */\n    bool visited[GS][GS]; /* array of bools to track progress */\n    int count = 0; /* number of graphs found */\n    processCmdArgs(input, argc, argv);\n\n    /* populate array */\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; GS; i++) {\n        for (int j = 0; j &lt; GS; j++) {\n            input &gt;&gt; arr[i][j];\n        }\n    }\n    input.close();\n\n    /*init visited */\n    for (int y = yLo; y &lt; GS; y++) {\n        for (int x = xLo; x &lt; GS; x++) {\n            visited[x][y] = false;\n        }\n    }\n\n    /* print array */\n    cout &lt;&lt; ""The array to find a graph is:\\n"";\n    print(arr);\n\n    /* find graph(s) in array */\n    queue Q;\n    for (int j = yLo; j &lt; GS; j++) {\n        for (int k = xLo; k &lt; GS; k++) {\n            if (arr[k][j] == 1) {\n                count++;\n                xLo = xHi = k;\n                yLo = yHi = j;\n                point *p = new point(k, j);\n                Q.insert(p);\n                delete p;\n                visited[k][j] = true;\n                while (!Q.isEmpty()) {\n                    *p = Q.del(); /* does this really work?

Tiny stuff, like little winforms components, among other things. I am looking for a website where I could release this sort of stuff to the public with licensing on it. I don't need something like Google Code/Sourceforge/Codeplex, as it's too big for tiny classes that I know can help others. Something like the PHP Classes Repository, but for .NET. I don't need things like version control, forums, wikis, issue trackers... I just want a place to share code quickly and easily. Does a such a site exist? As I realized when I was commenting on an answer, the ideal vision of what I'm looking for (in my head) is something like the ""flickr"" of code. Something where I can toss up a package of source, write a brief description, tag it, and be done with it. If something like that doesn't exist, maybe I just found my next side project. Joe answered with CodeKeep which is almost EXACTLY what I'm looking for, but it doesn't handle things like licensing, and it's almost a little too basic. But this is the closest so far.

3891526,Startup view for iPad/iPhone with Titanium,"I am building an app with Titanium, where I load a big remote xml file on startup. It shows the usual Default.png splash screen, and then gets to the window, where it says that it's loading. But what I want to do, is to make the splash screen stick until the xml is fully loaded. Now my approach for this is quite simple, I create an imageView at the start, with the Default.png as the image like so: and once the xhr.onload function is triggered (meaning the xml file is fully loaded), I fade out this startup view by doing: This works fine and all, but the problem I have is, that there are different splash screen sizes for different platforms. And so far the app I am creating works well on both platforms. On the ipad the screen is obviously bigger, on the iphone 4, the retina display is also bigger compared to iphone 3gs etc. Therefor I need to come up with something to make this code work nice everywhere. I tried to check with and load the smaller size splash screen for the iphone into the imageview, but somehow it's not the same as the ""real"" splash screen underneath it. Because of this, the user sees that the initial splash screen and the faked splash screen is shifting. It seems like the default splash screen loaded by titanium is not the same as Default.png, but it's the Default-Portrait.png (which should only be used for the ipad) I have no idea whether this all is clear, and whether someone here can think with me, but any ideas would be greatly appreciated.","[""var startupView =Titanium.UI.createImageView({\nimage: 'iphone/Default-Portrait.png',\nopacity:1,\nzIndex:2\n});\n"", 'var startupAnimation = Titanium.UI.createAnimation({\ncurve:Ti.UI.ANIMATION_CURVE_EASE_OUT,\nopacity:0,\ndelay: 0,\nduration:300\n});\nstartupView.animate(startupAnimation);\n', 'if (Titanium.Platform.osname == ""iphone"") {']",False

4030506,C# Compilation Error When Trying To Implement An Abstract Generic Class On An Extended Type T,"I am using generics and feel I've gone in too deep over my head and was wondering if StackOverflow could help? I think it would be much easier to explain my question using a simplified version of my code, rather than an abstract example of class A extending class B etc. I do apologise though if it is too simplistic. My C# (Windows Phone 7 .NET 3.5) application fires requests to a webservice and consumes the XML response populating a Result object derived from a base class WebServiceResult. Originally it fired the request, parsed the response and then the calling method would type cast the Result into the result it was expecting. I thought that since we know what type of result we are expecting, this was pointless and tried to use generic to over come this. Implementation of ""Registration"" webservice request The compiler error says Cannot implicitly convert type 'RegistrationResultParser' to '' This is about as far as I can go without going round and round in circles.

4043235,Why is my favicon appearing on Amazon S3 endpoint but not on the forwarded domain?,"I have tried everything possible and am out of ideas as to why my favicon is still not appearing. If I told you how much time I've spent trying to figure this out you'd understand why i'm on the verge of losing my mind. Here's the rundown [i'm not technical- just starting to learn so please bear with me]: I'm using Amazon S3 as my host. GoDaddy is the DNS and I have forwarding with a mask setup so that the amazon endpoint is directed to the actual domain. Here's the strange thing-- the favicon appears on the amazon endpoint but doesn't on the forwarded domain which is where I want it to appear. The favicon also appears when I do some testing using Dreamweaver. I can assure you that it isn't a matter a clearing the cache as I've done that numerous times and have ran tests to make sure that it's working. I've tried all the possible different types of variations of code and nothing works. I'm led to believe that it's not an issue with the code, cache, file but rather something else that is out of my realm of knowledge. So I come to Stackoverflow.

4047365,"Custom sorting, always force 0 to back of ascending order?","Premise This problem has a known solution (shown below actually), I'm just wondering if anyone has a more elegant algorithm or any other ideas/suggestions on how to make this more readable, efficient, or robust. Background I have a list of sports competitions that I need to sort in an array. Due to the nature of this array's population, 95% of the time the list will be pre sorted, so I use an improved bubble sort algorithm to sort it (since it approaches O(n) with nearly sorted lists). 0 if comp1 is greater, &lt;0 if comp2 is greater, 0 if the two are equal. The competitions are compared first by a priority field, then by game start time, and then by Home Team Name. The priority field is the trick to this problem. It is an int that holds a positve value or 0. They are sorted with 1 being first, 2 being second, and so on with the exception that 0 or invalid values are always last. e.g. the list of priorities 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 1, 3, 0 would be sorted as 1, 2, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0 The other little quirk, and this is important to the question, is that 95% of the time, priority will be it's default 0, because it is only changed if the user wants to manually change the sort order, which is rarely. So the most frequent case in the compare function is that priorities are equal and 0. The Code This is my existing compare algorithm. Question How can this algorithm be improved? And more importantly... Is there a better way to force 0 to the back of the sort order? I want to emphasize that this code seems to work just fine, but I am wondering if there is a more elegant or efficient algorithm that anyone can suggest. Remember that nPriority will almost always be 0, and the competitions will usually sort by start time or home team name, but priority must always override the other two.","['int CompareCompetitions(const SWI_COMPETITION &amp;comp1,const SWI_COMPETITION &amp;comp2)\n{\n\n    if(comp1.nPriority == comp2.nPriority)\n    {\n     //Priorities equal\n     //Compare start time\n     int ret = comp1.sStartTime24Hrs.CompareNoCase(comp2.sStartTime24Hrs);\n     if(ret != 0)\n     {\n      return ret; //return compare result\n     }else\n     {\n      //Equal so far\n      //Compare Home team Name\n      ret = comp1.sHLongName.CompareNoCase(comp2.sHLongName);\n      return ret;//Home team name is last field to sort by, return that value\n     }\n    }\n    else if(comp1.nPriority &gt; comp2.nPriority)\n    {\n     if(comp2.nPriority &lt;= 0)\n      return -1;\n     else\n      return 1;//comp1 has lower priority\n    }else /*(comp1.nPriority &lt; comp2.nPriority)*/\n    {\n     if(comp1.nPriority &lt;= 0)\n      return 1;\n     else\n      return -1;//comp1 one has higher priority\n    }\n}\n']",False

4069997,"objective-c string, string-formatter","I have a program with which dreamlax worked a lot with me on, which uses Objective-C to convert temperatures between the Fahrenheit, Celsius, Kelvin and Rankine temperature scales, but converting console-input into Kelvin, and then from Kelvin to the end-user's desired temperature scale. Now, I have an idea I would like to implement for the final prompt of the converted temperatures once the calculations are done. It is set up currently to only display like so: x degrees temperature-scale Where x = the final converted temperature, and temperature-scale = the scale the user wishes to have his temperature converted to. Suppose the end-user selected Fahrenheit as his/her source temperature, wishing to convert 212 degrees into his/her target temperature scale of Celsius. The conversions should equal 100 degrees Celsius obviously, but I think the program would be better of displaying the result like this: 212 degrees Fahrenheit is 100 degrees Celsius. Now, I've made the values that need to be replaced by variables in bold. I have the 212 and 100 values solved easily, because 100 variable has been there in the first place, and 212 can easily be remedied by replacing it with the string formatter of the sourceTemp variable, the variable which contains the users original inputted temperature. Now, the Fahrenheit string is a bit different. I have tried to establish something new in the original switch like so: OK, so I have added to each different case, setting a new variable named sourceTempText to either 1-4, the same value that the end-user chose to pick his/her source temperature. Now, here is how I tried to display the final prompt to the end-user with the final switch: I am not sure now, if I can insert sourceTempText into the string like I have here, instead, maybe I have to use a string formatter, but I'm not sure. It should be an easy fix, I just wanted to throw it out here! :) P.S. sorry for the kind of messy question formatting, I kind of didn't know how to phrase it so please ask for clarification if needed.","['switch (prompt) \n{\n    case 1:\n        //end-user chooses Fahrenheit\n        [converter setFahrenheitValue:sourceTemp];\n        sourceTempText = 1;\n        break;\n\n    case 2:\n        //end-user chooses Celsius\n        [converter setCelsiusValue:sourceTemp];\n        sourceTempText = 2;\n        break;\n\n    case 3:\n        //end-user chooses Kelvin\n        [converter setKelvinValue:sourceTemp];\n        sourceTempText = 3;\n        break;\n\n    case 4:\n        //end-user chooses Rankine\n        [converter setRankineValue:sourceTemp];\n        sourceTempText = 4;\n        break;\n}\n', 'switch (prompt2) \n{\n    case 1:\n        //end-user chooses Fahrenheit\n        printf(""%lf degrees sourceTempText is %lf degrees Fahrenheit\\n"", sourceTemp, [converter fahrenheitValue]);\n        break;\n\n    case 2:\n        //end-user chooses Celsius\n        printf(""%lf degrees sourceTempText is %lf degrees Celsius\\n"", sourceTemp, [converter celsiusValue]);\n        break;\n\n    case 3:\n        //end-user chooses Kelvin\n        printf(""%lf degrees sourceTempText is %lf degrees Kelvin\\n"", sourceTemp, [converter kelvinValue]);\n        break;\n\n    case 4:\n        //end-user chooses Rankine\n        printf(""%lf degrees sourceTempText is %lf degrees Rankine\\n"", sourceTemp, [converter rankineValue]);\n        break;\n}\n']",False

Edges with respective start node and end node as well as the weight (length of the node). I put both details in the same file so users dont have to download multiple files to get their map working (it could become time consuming and seem complex). So what i did is to seperate the deferent details by typing out location Names and coordinates first, After that I seperated that section from the next section which is the edges by drawing a line with multiple underscores. Now the problem I'm having is parsing the different details into seperate arrays by setting up a command (while manually tokenizing the input stream) to check wether the the next token is an underscore. If it is, (in pseudocode terms), move to the next line in the stream, create a new array and fill it up with the next set of details. I found a some explanation/code HERE that does something similar but still parses into one array, although it manually tokenizes the input. Any ideas on what to do?

Added: The same problem exist when copying files, it hangsup between large files Similar problem exist when I tried to use TotalCommander (x64): copying paused at 80% of one of files, TC didn't hung up (but clicking cancel in copying dialog box doesn't have any effect). During this pause I can't kill TotalCmd.exe just like Explorer.exe Added (2): This problem seems to disappear when I use 32 bit applications (like TotalCommander (x86) ), but I need to do more testing to be sure of this Added (3): There are several errors in event log, source: disk, id: 11, qualifiers: 49156, task: 0, level: 2, keywords: 0x80000000000000 (This may be important, and I forgot to mention this): Main disk is encrypted via Truecrypt (boot-in password)",[],False

4629114,Async Netty HttpServer and HttpClient,"I have been exploring Netty for the past days, as I am writing a quick and tight HTTP server that should receive lots of requests, and Netty's HTTP server implementation is quite simple and does the job. My next step is as part of the request handling, I need to launch an HTTP request to an external web server. My intuition is to implement an asynchronous client that can send a lot of requests simultaneously, but I am a little confused as what is the right approach. My understanding is that Netty server uses a worker thread for each incoming message, therefore that worker thread would not be freed to accept new messages until my handler finishes its work. Here is the punch: even if I have an asynchronous HTTP client in hand, it won't matter if I need to wait for each response and process it back with my server handler - the same worker thread would remain blocking all this time. The alternative is to use the async nature of the client, returning a future object quickly to release the thread and place a listener (meaning I have to return 200 or 202 status to the client), and check my future object to indicate when the response is received and I can push it to the client. Does this make sense? Am I way off with my assumptions? What is a good practice to implement such kind of Netty acceptor server + external client with high concurrency? Thanks,",[],False
4636672,Source to source manipulations,"I need to do some source-to-source manipulations in Linux kernel. I tried to use clang for this purpose but there is a problem. Clang does preprocessing of the source code, i.e. macro and include expansion. This causes clang to sometimes produce broken C code in terms of Linux kernel. I can't maintain all the changes manually, since I expect to have thousands of changes per single file. I tried ANTLR, but the public grammars available are incomplete and not suitable for such projects as Linux kernel. So my question is the following. Are there any ways to perform source-to-source manipulations for a C code without preprocessing it? So assume following code. After applying source-to-source manipulation I want to get this But Clang, for instance, produces following code which does not fit my requirements, i.e. it expands macro AAA I hope I was clear enough. Edit The above code is only an example. The source-to-source manipulations I want to do are not restricted with statement substitution, but also inserting unary operator in front of expression, replace arithmetic expression with its positive or negative value, etc. Solution There is one solution I found for my self.

4747119,Multipart form with data output to browser in jQuery/PHP. How to show input data?,I'm trying to create a form with 3 steps: fill the form check if data is correct (show input) thank you With an advice of some people here (regarding my previous question) I've changed my way of doing it from mainly PHP + js-validation to mainly js + PHP process data. I need an advice with how to deal with this now. Previously I've had a PHP if/else that determined which step to show and kept data in $_SESSION for 2nd step and possible corrections back in 1st step. Now I'm wondering if I really need two ajax calls (first to process data in order to show it - 2nd form step uses $_SESSION to display data input in 1st step; second to generate e-mail and pdf with given data - same $_SESSION as step2). Maybe a good solution would be to put data with javascript into 2nd step aswell and use $_SESSION only in the final processing and generating. What's the common/your approach to this problem?,[],False

I have a ASP.NET site , WCF IIS hosted service and WPF xbap app. What I'm trying to do is pass variables from the ASP.NET site to the WPF xbap app. So I have setup a WCF service with a wsDualHttpBinding and using callbacks to notify the ASP.NET and the xbap. Now when I host the WCF service in IIS 6 on our server and run ASP.NET hosting in VS2012 iisexpress locally and xbap locally. It works fine. But as soon as I publish the ASP.NET site to the IIS 6 on our server, callback are never received by the ASP.NET app. Both are in the application pool. Is there a setting, or something I need to be looking for to have the ASP.NET to keep open the listening port for the callbacks? The XBAP is still receiving the callbacks, no problem. The service config is as follows: (note I have maxed out the buffers because of simplicity for the moment to rule that out) The service has methods where clients will subscribe to callback lists. Then methods will increment through the list to send the invoke the callbacks. Below is the WCF Service header, Ive skipped putting in the methods. Now for the ASP.NET Client web.config Then XBAP app client app.config In both clients I have used the Add Service Reference method, to add the WCF to both the ASP.NET and XBAP projects. I have setup both clients to have the code and of course handle the methods for each callback. I know it looks a bit long winded, but I wanted to show as much about the problem as I could.

Inside the ViewPager I don't use Fragments, just inflated views (a RelativeLayout with some content). These views are pre-created and held in a List.

4835443,Exposing DataGrid's cell template as a custom user control property in Silverlight 4,"I'm building custom user control in Silverlight 4. The idea behind the control is to move data grid with pager from user page to a control. Currently data grid looks like: What I mostly wanted to achieve apart from removing repetitive code of this grid from few pages, is giving this control flexibility to define that template column by a user. In other words I'm trying to expose DataGrid column property so it is possible to add different DataGridTemplateColumns. Since I have low experience with SL I did some research and according to what I've found 'attached properties' is what I need(need confirmation on this). I defined DependencyProperty using this tutorial. like this (controls code - CustomerControl) : Control's XAML: Since I exposed property of type 'DataGridTemplateColumn' I fought the rest of template declaration won't change, but this does not work :( I'm not sure about this attached properties.

You can see the formula in the accepted answer here: Applying a Math Formula in a more elegant way (maybe a recursive call would do the trick). I'm not a professional coder so I'm trying my best to translate it but my skills are limited and I've encountered several problems. Let's start. There's a vector containing players' stacks: I think a bidimensional array should do the work here. I'd add a key to identify each player. Now he wants to create a Matrix of values, I did my researches and found a PEAR package called Math_Matrix, installed it but I'm wondering how to create that sort of matrix. I'm worried that I won't be able to translate the entire code because he uses advances methods like recursive calls etc. Could you please take a look there and help me?

4914450,Why does everybody use unanchored namespace declarations (i.e. std:: not ::std::)?,"It seems to me that using unanchored namespaces is just asking for trouble later when someone puts in a new namespace that happens to have the same name as a root level namespace and mysteriously alters the meaning of a whole lot of programs. So, why do people always say instead of . Do they really mean to be saying ""I want to use whatever is handy, not the root one.""? Here is an example of what I mean: In fred/Foo.h: In fred/Bar.h: In oops.cpp: Is that what people want, or am I missing something? And maybe you say that you should just never name a namespace . And that's all well and good, but what about some other root level namespace then? Should any root level namespace anybody ever defines anywhere always be off-limits for a sub-namespace name?

5001733,Programmatically join Windows machine to AD domain,"This is similar to, but not a dupe of, this question - however, where it sought information on manually joining a server to a domain (and was rightly redirected) I am looking for help with some code that programmatically joins a machine to a domain. The scenario is that we have a launcher service that instantiates Amazon EC2 Server2008R1 VMs, optionally passing a Machine Name in through the User-Data stream. A process is baked into our images that checks User-Data for a name on bootup - If none is present then the VM remains outside of our Cloud domain, but if the name is present then the machine is renamed as specified and auto-joined to the domain. Here's the problem - if I run this process manually any time after instance start, it works exactly as described; the machine name is changed, and the VM is joined to the domain (we force a restart to make this happen). However, when running as a Scheduled Task (triggered on startup) the machine rename happens as expected, but the subsequent call to (see below) picks-up the old randomised machine name given to the VM by EC2 instead of the new name it has just been assigned. This results in a WMI return code of 8525, we get a disconnected misnamed entry in the AD repository (of that randomised name) and the machine is not joined to the domain. The VM then restarts, and a second pass through the startup process (abnormally triggered because there is content in User-Data but the machine is not yet in the domain) executes all the same steps and succeeds. It looks like the machine name is set in the first pass but not 'finalised', and still sees the original name. On the second pass, the machine name is already set properly, and so works as expected. Quite why the process behaves this way during startup, but works perfectly when run manually on an already-started VM, is I think the nub of the problem. I've tried inserting a delay between the rename and join steps in case the call to was happening before the rename was finalised behind the scenes, but this hasn't helped - and I didn't really expect it to, since the whole process works perfectly when run manually. So it's probably a combination of a subtle difference in machine state during bootup and something silly in the code. Maybe using in the method is inadvisable? But it stil fails even if I pass the new name in as a string as I do for . So I'm stumped. Here's the WMI code that renames the machine: And here's the WMI code that joins it to the domain: Apologies if this code looks mind-numbingly stupid - I'm new to WMI, and this is largely cribbed from examples I've found on the interwebs; if there's a smarter/neater way to do this then by all means demonstrate.

5236737,Advanced algebraic topology topics overview,"Recently I became very much intrigued by algebraic topology and am spending quite some time learning it. My reasons are three-fold: it's a beautiful theory; it gives geometric justification to (or perhaps rather an application of) many purely algebraic structures; and it has fascinating applications in quantum field theory and condensed matter theory. Nevertheless, what I am familiar with currently are just basics: various homology and cohomology theories, homotopy theory and some standard applications (Brouwer, Borsuk-Ulam, etc., etc.). While these are of course interesting of and by themselves (and I expect spending a great amount of time on understanding all of this properly), I guess it is more or less understood for some fifty years now, so supposedly people work on topics far more advanced than this (or at the very least they use far more advanced tools to understand standard but hard problems). So, I'd also like to know what the field is about from the modern perspective (some interesting problems and research topics, advanced tools, etc.) so that I can see a little where will the study of the subject lead me in the long run. Sorry if the question is too broad but I am not sure where else to look (I've more or less browsed through all general articles on AT at wikipedia and tried to search MO too). I've heard few magic words like K-theory, sheaf cohomology, various spectral sequences, etc. but I don't understand these at all yet; more importantly my motivation to learn these things is lacking since I have no idea how or when these magic words are used (although I am pretty sure they are used a lot).",[],False
5240607,lpfc + multipath + ubuntu - path keeps switching,"I am having issues configuring multipath using Emulex (lpfc). Although I do not detect data corruption the SAN administrator has a tool that shows that the paths are being switched every 20 seconds or so. Here are the details: The multiple paths are connected to the same LUN. Here's the /etc/multipath.conf fdisk -l I increased the verbosity for lpfc and now I get the following on dmesg: Can someone see anything wrong with this config? Thank you. Based on janneb's comments I changed the configuration in multipath.conf to: Which now gives: But it still goes [active][undef] after a while, then back to [ready]. Oh I just noticed something, when I run 'multipath -l' I get [undef], however if I run 'multipath -ll' I get [ready]. Is the setup wrong? How can I debug? Thanks. Thank you janneb and zerolagtime for helping out. Here's how it gets complicated, I thought I would not need to explain all this, and I am currently leaning towards hardware setup mixup. There are actually two servers connected to the same LUN using FC. On the OS level only one server would access the filesystem (although the same LUN is exposed to both) , since it is ext3 (not a clustering filesystem). If server 1 goes down, server 2 kicks in (linux-ha) and mounts the filesystem. Server 1 (multipath -ll): Server 2 (multipath -ll): Server 1 port names: Server 2 port names: Is this setup wrong? Is the way that the LUN exposed to both server wrong? I am thinking that the hardware hookup is incorrect, what could be wrong? Could server1 path_checker interfering with server2's operation?

5299712,"accept returns existing connection, causing seg fault","I am creating a server daemon in c that accepts numerous simultaneous connections, and the clients will be sending data to the server. I currently have each client connection being spawned into a new thread.

5352782,Should I Dispose() DataSet and DataTable?,"DataSet and DataTable both implement IDisposable, so, by conventional best practices, I should call their Dispose() methods. However, from what I've read so far, DataSet and DataTable don't actually have any unmanaged resources, so Dispose() doesn't actually do much. Plus, I can't just use because DataSet has a collection of DataTables. So, to be safe, I'd need to iterate through myDataSet.Tables, dispose of each of the DataTables, then dispose of the DataSet. So, is it worth the hassle to call Dispose() on all of my DataSets and DataTables? Addendum: For those of you who think that DataSet should be disposed: In general, the pattern for disposing is to use or , because you want to guarantee that Dispose() will be called. However, this gets ugly real fast for a collection. For example, what do you do if one of the calls to Dispose() thrown an exception? Do you swallow it (which is ""bad"") so that you can continue on to dispose the next element? Or, do you suggest that I just call myDataSet.Dispose(), and forget about disposing the DataTables in myDataSet.Tables?","['using(DataSet myDataSet...)', 'using', 'try..finally']",False

5469031,Construction of graded rings and modules,"In Algebraic Geometry and Homological Algebra - as far as I know - we often consider graded rings and modules so as to encode more information, say, some sort of (computational) complexity. For example, the powers of an ideal give rise to a filtration on the ring (and also on a module over that ring), which finally provides us with the associated graded ring (respectively, module), having important geometric attributes. I am just wondering whether there are any less common methods (of course, beyond the standard) to obtain graded algebraic structures. EDIT: Perhaps I omitted some details. Here they are. I am currently working on the resolution of singular algebraic varieties, and I have just come up with the idea of somehow measuring the badness of singularities in terms of the Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity. Thus, I need graded structures where the degrees encode important information about the singular behaviour. Since we work with polynomial algebras, we have standard techniques (e.g. weights associated to the generators, or the one I described above), however, even in the case of hypersurfaces, they are of no interest. Hence, I am curious about other methods that, given a ring (or a module), result in a graded ring (respectively, module) having some similarities with the original one.",[],False

This of course works fine if the file is an application resource and compiled with the application. This silverlight application will be hosted through a website deployed on a server. This server has a partition specifically for repositories of files. These files in the ""D:"" partition are currently accessed by an ASPX web application and displayed in a PDF viewer. We're moving to silverlight, so as the user selects the grid row representation of that file in the repository, I know the ""NAME"" of the file.

But in running, the result is not as expected. background thread is running, it keeps to request server. UI thread is blocked, I still cannot do anything. is this cause a long loop in background thread? Although I have 2 thread, but they will compete CPU resources(test device is iPod, 1 core.

5611720,SQL Trigger After Delete to Work With Multiple Row Delete,"I have a table with an ""order"" column which needs to maintain a contiguous range of unique numbers. What I'm trying to create is a trigger that fires after deleting rows which updates the ""order"" column so that the numbers remain contiguous. I know a lot of people would argue that an ""order"" column only needs to be continuous, not contiguous, however there is a lot of front end JavaScript, and other SQL, for ordering/reordering these items which depends on order being contiguous. I would prefer to simply get this trigger working rather than having to rewrite that, of course I'm open to suggestions ;) The trigger I have works fine for a single row delete, but when a multiple row delete occurs, only the first row gets deleted and the rest remain with no error thrown.

Basically in the TCP level what I want to happen is something like this: 1- whenever a client sends a SYN to my proxy, the proxy just sends a message to the real server telling the ip and port of the client. 2- The server would then send the corresponding SYN-ACK to the specified client creating a direct connection between client and server.

5742235,Algorithms for Performing Large Integer Matrix Operations w/ Numerical Stability,"I'm looking for a library that performs matrix operations on large sparse matrices w/o sacrificing numerical stability. Matrices will be 1000+ by 1000+ and values of the matrix will be between 0 and 1000. I will be performing the index calculus algorithm (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_calculus_algorithm) so I will be generating (sparse) row vectors of the matrix serially. As I develop each row, I will need to test for linear independence. Once I fill my matrix with the desired number of linearly independent vectors, I will then need to transform the matrix into reduced row echelon form. The problem now is that my implementation uses Gaussian elimination to determine linear independence (ensuring row echelon form once all my row vectors have been found). However, given the density and size of the matrix, this means the entries in each new row become exponentially larger over time, as the lcm of the leading entries must be found in order to perform cancellation. Finding the reduced form of the matrix further exacerbates the problem. So my question is, is there an algorithm, or better yet an implementation, that can test linear independence and solve the reduced row echelon form while keeping the entries as small as possible? An efficient test for linear independence is especially important since in the index calculus algorithm it is performed by far the most. Thanks in advance!",[],False
