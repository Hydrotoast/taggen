2562,Special characters not displaying correctly,"I'm sure this has been asked a dozen times, but all of the other questions I've seen haven't been able to shed any light on the problem. I'm developing a site for a Norweigan client and obviously they'd like to use their native language to display some content. The problem is, some of the special characters aren't displaying correctly and I can't for the life of me figure out why. An example can be seen at the link below http://e360.deanelliott.me/ As you can see, some characters are displaying as the question mark in a black diamond instead of the ø or å that they're supposed to. The encoding of pages is set to UTF-8 if that helps.",[],False

11481,Return extra data besides tree data from ExtJS TreeLoader dataUrl?,"I asked this question in the Ext JS forums, but I received no responses, so I am asking here. I have a TreePanel (code below) that uses a TreeLoader and an AsyncTreeNode. In my API method specified by the TreeLoader's dataUrl, I return a JSON array to populate the tree. This works great, of course. However, I need to return an additional item--an integer--in addition to the array, and I need to display that value somewhere else in my UI. Is this possible? If not, what else would be a good solution? Here's the code I have currently: I want to return one single integer value for the entire response--not per node. Basically my API method will create a database record, and I need to return a value from that database record. EDIT Thanks to Mike, I have solved this problem.

47111,"Business website hosted publicly (for APIs, etc) needs to be accessible ONLY from inside office?","Would appreciate your patience with this question; still learning a lot of things. My Taxi booking start-up has a website (CakePHP) hosted on EC2 (for reliability) which is a ERP of sorts used only by internal employees. This tool also interacts with the Cabs/Taxis' GPS receivers in that these GPS machines send some data to the public server through some APIs which help decide logic for the Booking process. And as we don't have very strong Net on premises, we've kept it all on EC2. Now, we are increasingly concerned about leaving information (customer data, vehicle info) like this on the public domain and accessible from the internet and outside the premises by a rogue employee. For our implementation, MySQL replication has already been considered with us reading from a local slave, writing to the master and etc. The only issue being, there's no way non-technical employees would know whether the data is new or whether the replication is broken. Also, we'd prefer our servers online as we don't want to invest in physical security for this hardware. We are thinking of the following: IP address based auth; those belonging to the local NAT would be allowed. Problem is we have a dynamic IP. Computername/MacID based auth; almost no-security once the user finds out. Also, can we read these parameters from Chrome? Storing a list of IP addresses that login and as there are just 6 employees, we'd be able to monitor it for weird IPs. Not scalable or even secure. Hosts file configuration on employee PC and this ""host"" would be configured on apache2 so directly hitting the IP address would do no good. Again, needs one smart employee. SSH based routing to the mainserver with access only from localhost on the main server..but unable to configure this. Do help us out!",[],False

This is where my checkboxes are created(dynamically): So, I tried to add this script, but it's not working: I also tried this way - to use this javascript: And it works, but it works on already present controls, and I guess I need to create mine dynamically, or maybe not? And I tried to hide a present control with CSS, but then when the script shows it, it is there, only invisible :) Also, I would want to get the name and value of the radio buttons from my database, i.e. Model(this is ASP.NET MVC)..

Is there any sensible way to emulate it in a web application powered by PHP/5.2 that connects to a remote Oracle 10g server via ODBC (with Oracle's driver, not Microsoft's).

301223,django weighted questionnaire?,"I've been learning django off and on for a few years now and consider myself an advanced beginner, ha. I'm working on a ""weighted questionnaire"" (that's the best name I can give it anyway) for a client and have gone in circles about where to go with it. The client has come up with a series of yes or no questions and depending on the answer, certain weightings will be applied. At the end upon submission, I need to check for answers and add up the weightings than show a report with suggested products based on the weightings. The weightings are really just products with certain number values for each question. For example: ""Do you smoke?"" If answered ""yes"", then apply the following: Core(1), Alpha(4), Liver(2), Jade(1), Rejuve(4) I've setup initial models and admin but am kind of stumped with how to write the views. They'll be able to add questions with desired answers, then as many weightings (which are foreign keyed to products) and values per question as they want. Here are my models: I'm manually creating the forms right now. I figure this is the best way. So, what'll be the best way to get the answers on post, then compare the answer with the desired answer and get the sum of the weightings across all questions?

318115,Using XPATH to select from a specific range of repeated nodes,I am attempting to parse a document that has the following (much simplified) structure.

It is straight forward to extract the index'th OBX.3.2 in the entire document using: But I am not sure how to find the index'th OBX.3.2 associated with say the second OBR or indeed how to count the number of OBX segments for each OBR (If I new this I could probably solve the problem).

385158,WCF oData dataservice WebInvoke (POST) Linked Entity,"First of all I am new to .NET WCF oData DataService and I am using jQuery on the client side. I am looking for a better way (right way) to handle adding 2 different entities in one transaction (post). Eg. I have a Parent entity with ID and Name and Child entity with ID,ParentID and Name. I would like to add parent and get parent's id and use it to add each child. However, while adding either the parent or one of the child entity fails, then it should roll back all the transactions. One way, I thought of doing it is by creating a WebInvoke Method which would take a json string like this {""Parent"":{""name"":""Daddy""},""Children"":[{""name"":""Tom""},{""name"":""Dick""},{""name"":""Harry""}]} While testing I hardcoded argument in the method, on invoke everything worked fine. However, when calling POST from jQuery, the parameter comes in as NULL (annoying). I was able to send parameter to the method by passing the urlencoded json string as part of query string. However, query string has size limit and I prefere not to use it. Question 1) Is it possible to use WebInvoke POST with parameter(s) in WCF Data Service? Question 2) Is there a better way (right way) to do what I am trying to do. Another way of doing it (I don't like it) is to call POST on parent entity and get its ID and using it to post for each child. If one of it fails then call delete for all.",[],False

410457,QuickSort Stack Overflow,"My generic QuickSort algorithm has two problems that I can't determine the cause of. The list is sometimes not correctly sorted When dealing with lists larger than 20,000 items, I often get stack overflows if the values repeat a lot (which I presume isn't supposed to be a real issue) The list not being sorted correctly is a fairly rare occurrence, so the list has to be reasonably large. The paste below shows the first 13 elements of a 172-element list of installed software with the first column showing the output after the first sort, and second column for a second sort. As you can see, the first time it was sorted, there is some incorrect behaviour, which is fixed by doing another sort. The second problem with stack overflows happens if I sort my big-ol' Windows Event Log list. It seems to be happy if I sort 52,000 dates spanning 4 weeks; but if I sort 52,000 ID numbers which have many repeats, my stack size becomes 998 items long before it crashes the system. It also happens if I sort a 30,000 long list by a column which is mostly 'gupdate'. Now, as far as I can see, the stack count should be log2(n) because the amount added to the stack is equal to the amount of cutting-in-half that is done. I made my pivot random to aid this effect, but it didn't make a lot of difference. Log2(60000) = 16. That's not enough for a stack overflow! This is the code in concern: For anyone interested, this is the fix for the out-of-order glitch. Basically, it was failing to recognise a 2-element array when it was out of order. Such as {E, B}, which it would not change because it wouldn't look at its own pivot. Will update once I write a solution for the stack overflow.","['Adobe AIR                         7-Zip 4.65 (x64 edition)\n7-Zip 4.65 (x64 edition)          Adobe AIR\nAdobe Community Help              Adobe Community Help\nAdobe Encore CS4 Codecs           Adobe Encore CS4 Codecs\nAdobe Media Encoder CS4 Exporter  Adobe Media Encoder CS4 Exporter\nAdobe Media Encoder CS4 Importer  Adobe Media Encoder CS4 Importer\nAdobe Media Player                Adobe Media Player\nAdobe Reader X (10.1.0)           Adobe Reader X (10.1.0)\nAdobe Setup                       Adobe Setup\nAdobe Setup                       Adobe Setup\nApple Application Support         Adobe Setup\nAdobe Setup                       Apple Application Support\nApple Mobile Device Support       Apple Mobile Device Support\n...                               ...\n', 'private static void QuickSortFunction&lt;T&gt;(T[] array, int start, int end, Comparer&lt;T&gt; comparer)\n{\n    if (end - start &gt;= 1)\n    {\n        int leftPtr, rightPtr, pivot;\n        Random random = new Random();\n        pivot = random.Next(start, end);\n        Swap(array, pivot, start);\n        pivot = start;\n\n        leftPtr = start + 1;\n        rightPtr = end;\n\n        while (leftPtr &lt; rightPtr)\n        {\n            while ((comparer.Compare(array[leftPtr], array[pivot])) &lt;= 0 &amp;&amp; (leftPtr &lt; rightPtr))\n            {\n                leftPtr++;\n            }\n\n            while ((comparer.Compare(array[rightPtr], array[pivot])) &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; (leftPtr &lt;= rightPtr))\n            {\n                rightPtr--;\n            }\n\n            if (leftPtr &lt; rightPtr)\n            {\n                Swap(array, leftPtr, rightPtr);\n            }\n        }\n        Swap(array, pivot, rightPtr);\n        pivot = rightPtr;\n\n        QuickSortFunction(array, start, pivot - 1, comparer);\n        QuickSortFunction(array, pivot + 1, end, comparer);\n    }\n}\n\nprivate static void Swap&lt;T&gt;(T[] array, int pointer1, int pointer2)\n{\n    T temp = array[pointer1];\n    array[pointer1] = array[pointer2];\n    array[pointer2] = temp;\n}\n', '    if (end - start &gt;= 1)\n    {\n        int leftPtr, rightPtr, pivot;\n        Random random = new Random();\n        pivot = random.Next(start, end);\n        Swap(array, pivot, start);\n        pivot = start;\n\n        leftPtr = start;\n        rightPtr = end;\n\n        while (leftPtr &lt; rightPtr)\n        {\n            while ((comparer.Compare(array[leftPtr], array[pivot])) &lt; 0 &amp;&amp; (leftPtr &lt; rightPtr))\n            {\n                leftPtr++;\n            }\n\n            while ((comparer.Compare(array[rightPtr], array[pivot])) &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; (leftPtr &lt; rightPtr))\n            {\n                rightPtr--;\n            }\n\n            if (leftPtr &lt; rightPtr)\n            {\n                Swap(array, leftPtr, rightPtr);\n            }\n        }\n        Swap(array, pivot, rightPtr);\n        pivot = rightPtr;\n\n        QuickSortFunction(array, start, pivot - 1, comparer);\n        QuickSortFunction(array, pivot + 1, end, comparer);\n    }\n']",False

Sum and multiplication are both defined as usual in $\mathbb{R}$. My guess is that there is one: $K$ should not contain continuum as it is field so in this case it would be equal to $\mathbb{R}$, so $K$ is countable, and $\mathbb{R}$ has no finite generating set over countable sets. On the other hand, $K$ can contain countable but infinite number of elements from $\mathbb{R} - \mathbb{Q}$ such that $\forall a \in \mathbb{R} - \mathbb{Q} \,\,\,\,a \in K \Rightarrow \exists b \in K, q \in \mathbb{Q}:a\neq q\cdot b$, i.e. contains infinite number of irrational numbers so that pairwise their division is not rational. In this case number of elements in $K$ basis is countable, but infinite (each irrational number is in basis, if its product with some rational number isn't in it). $K$ seems to be field and not equal to $\mathbb{R}$, but I'm not sure.

469531,Most efficient way to convert the x value of an NSValue CGPointValue into an NSNumber,"I have an array with a bunch of NSValue objects. These objects are essentially wrappers for CGPoints. I need to create an NSDictionary out of these CGPoints that records those points which have the greatest x value for a given y value. For example, there may be multiple points that share the same y value, but only that which has the greatest x value for that y value should be recorded in the NSDictionary. Ultimately, the y value is the key and the x value is the value of that key. As I loop through the array of NSValue objects, I need to compare their x values to the x value of an NSDictionary entry that has the same y value (and if that does not exist, create the entry). In order to do this, I use the method of the NSDictionary object. But this method requires an object of type (a nondescript object). Which brings me to the issue. That object of type that I'm going to pass to the method is simply the y value of a CGPoint. But I get that y value by first converting an NSValue object to a CGPoint. So once I've done that, I have to convert that y value back into an object (i.e. ). This seems kind of inefficient to me -- converting an object to a CGPoint in order to extract a CGFloat that then gets turned back into an object via NSNumber. Is there a better way to do this? Here's my current code:","['objectForKey', 'id', 'id', 'objectForKey', 'NSNumber numberWithFloat', 'for (NSValue *pt in myArrayOfPoints) {\n    NSNumber *y = [NSNumber numberWithFloat:[pt CGPointValue].y];\n    if ([leftSideEdgePtsFurthestInwards objectForKey:y] == nil) {\n    //yada yada yada\n    }\n}\n']",False

I didn't see any of his money, I've since left that job because they owe me months of back pay and it looks like I'm not going to end up getting much of it. (Bad situation) I want to consider the possibility now of exploring who owns any work I did that was unpaid, because if I need to, I can use it as leverage to help get my owed money. The company is still using some work in-house that's unpaid which I'm a lot clearer about contesting rights to. What's I'm struggling with is working out what to do about the clients website. From his POV he paid for it, it's his. From my POV I did it and didn't get paid for it so it's mine. Who owns it? If I do, I wouldn't want to strip it away from him, it seems really unfair, but I would like to use it as leverage if it comes to that.",[],False

I have an entity with a classification column which groups up entities into convenient categories for the user. These classifications are predefined and unchangeable by the user (at least thats the current design). EntityClassification:Id. I don't plan to have a name/description column in EntityClassification since my current thought is that I'll need to support localization of these pre-defined names which will be done with static string table like resource files downloaded to the client based on their country/language. There really isn't any other data which is associated with this EntityClassfication that I would want and a table seems like it might be an overkill? Is this common/recommend practice for this type of problem?

479112,Any visualizations of neural network decision process when recognizing images?,"I'm enrolled in Coursera ML class and I just started learning about neural networks. One thing that truly mystifies me is how recognizing something so “human”, like a handwritten digit, becomes easy once you find the good weights for linear combinations. It is even crazier when you understand that something seemingly abstract (like a car) can be recognized just by finding some really good parameters for linear combinations, and combining them, and feeding them to each other. Combinations of linear combinations are much more expressible than I once thought. This lead me to wonder if it is possible to visualize NN's decision process, at least in simple cases. For example, if my input is 20x20 greyscale image (i.e. total 400 features) and the output is one of 10 classes corresponding to recognized digits, I would love to see some kind of visual explanation of which cascades of linear combinations led the NN to its conclusion. I naïvely imagine that this may be implemented as visual cue over the image being recognized, maybe a temperature map showing “pixels that affected the decision the most”, or anything that helps to understand how neural network worked in a particular case. Is there some neural network demo that does just that?",[],False

I have a requirement to write a batch job that will read data from the Oracle database and populate the data onto a table on the SQL Server. Oracle supports ""Heterogeneous Services"" features where i can use an ODBC driver to create a database link from the Oracle database to the SQL Server database. The other option i have is use a Java process that uses JDBC to connect to the SQL Server and populate the data using the JDBC connection without database links.

673438,Do in-line ads indicate a SaaS product's monetization strategy is flawed?,"Before I continue with my question, I think there's a perfect real-world analogy to the creation of a new and shiny web application. (and yes, I chose the incendiary title to simply to draw you here ... we tolerate them at Google and I have no intention of quitting SO). When Wal-mart determines that a market will support a store, they build an nice, shiny, new facility and carefully stock it with really low-priced, nice-looking items. Business starts out brisk as people are curious about the new store, and while prices are artificially low. Once they've driven the competition out-of-business the store manager, under continued pressure to increase profits raises prices to the normal Wal-mart levels, and continues to increase the number of shoppers, since the competition has been eliminated. Once that growth phase has levelled off, the manager, under continued pressure to raise profits, orders more items than his store will logically hold, including large quantities of impulse items. Since this exceeds the store's capacity, many of these items are simply left on pallets and placed in the aisles. Target notices the growth of this market and realizes that many of these Wal-mart shoppers are in their demographics. They build a store and stock it with slightly better merchandise which is sold for somewhat more money than the equivalent product at Wal-mart. Many shoppers, who were dubious of the quality of Wal-marts items and irritated at navigating the increasingly cluttered aisles (especially during peak shopping hours), flock to Target where very little merchandise is ever placed in the aisles. The poor store manager is now stuck at an equilibrium and won't be seeing any more of the growth bonuses he's accustomed to. Some people return to the few remaining mom-and-pop stores in the area. In many cases, the Target (or mom-and-pop) shopper is paying more for exactly the same item. Why? Atmosphere. Studies have shown that it's not the presence of the impulse purchase items, or even the in-store advertising, but rather the general appearance of the store that ultimately determines the shoppers perception of the store (and chain). And open aisles are a huge factor in people's perceptions. In SaaS products, we expect to see advertising if we're using a free version of the software, but at what level does the advertising impede users to the point where they go elsewhere? I have a few questions that are much more specific, which I'd love to see hard numbers for or against. Not that I expect everyone to provide real figures in dollars, but most of these questions can be answered with a non-specific y-axis. If Jeff and Joel will indulge me, I'll frame them in terms of their web-sites. We've seen that SO started (at least when I first surfed here), with some side-bar advertising, but I just noticed there was an in-line ad this morning (here's a picture for those who haven't seen one). Here's what I'm curious to know (and it might take quite a while before some of these can be answered): How has the growth of SO impacted traffic to JoS/BoS/DoS? How has the inclusion of advertising on SO affected revenues? How has the inclusion of in-line advertising on SO impacted traffic (or maybe reduced the growth curve) if at all? What is the proper balance of ""impeding the customer"" and advertising to maximize both profits and traffic? Are you better off maximizing profits by charging for answers like some of the subscription Q&amp;A sites, even though it reduces traffic and search engine exposure? SaaS is obviously a fast-growing software product category, but there are challenges looming with consumers that are used to the Internet being free? The real question is how do we make a living off this category. I'm not sure I've seen the ""perfect answer"" yet!",[],False

In a testproject that approach worked very well. In a real life project it led to interference with another gem taking a - maybe similar - approach. This gem complained about missing methods in a class even when I only integrated my gem into the project - not even integrated acts_as_anything into the class. So I broke down my code to only that: As a result the other gem still breaks. I used class &lt;&lt; self.class.superclass to explicitly extend Object, so that even non ActiveSomething classes but ALL classes are affected and my acts_as_anything is available. So I remain with three questions. Why do the last 5 lines of code break another gem and making it complain about missing methods it's trying to dynamically create? I would like to understand. Is there a better approach to achieve my goal?

955106,Facebook - Google analytics not capturing inner tab page events/page tracking,The issue is that I'm using Google Analytics to capture user events as the proceed through my application (sits within a tab). The landing page is working fine and data is being sent to GA but when I click on a link on the landing page that takes the user to a new page (still inside the tab) the event/page tracking isn't being captured by Google. I can see the image being requested in Firebug and the parameters are fine but I don't see any instances of it event or the page being tracked in my GA account.

957406,inserting/reading Base64 strings with SQLite,"I tried to insert a base64 encoded string into my SQLite database, but when I read back the value, I get a different result than what I saved. More specifically, every time my string contains a ""+"" character, it gets stored as '?' in my db. I thought maybe the two non-alpha-numeric characters in base64-- namely, '+' and '/' are sensitive characters in SQLite, so I did some research and saw this page: http://www.sqlite.org/lang_expr.html I see that + is a unary operator, and / is a binary operator... but still, if I insert the string containing these characters into my table, it shouldn't cause any problems right? Also, this may be unrelated to the problem but I am coding with Javascript, the SQLite I'm using is a client side database for Firefox. As for the code, I'm storing with this API provided by Firefox: and I'm reading with this:","['db.record({COLNAME:MY_BASE64_STRING})\n', 'let db_query = ""SELECT * FROM "" + dbstore._tableName + "" WHERE col_1 = :row_id"";\nlet statement = dbstore._createStatement(db_query);\nstatement.params.row_id=base64_string;\n']",False

When I take them to my local photographic shop (I am not talking Boots etc) and get them back they have lost much of their vibrancy and mood. I spoke to the owner and he said that is because they can never recreate the colour on modern laptops/desktops? Is this right?

994321,Is it OK to flush the EntityManager from within a domain Service?,"I have a domain service called , with a method: class OrderService { // ... public function saveOrder(Order $order) { $this-&gt;orderRepository-&gt;add($order); // $this-&gt;entityManager-&gt;flush(); $this-&gt;notificationService-&gt;notifyOrderPlaced($order); } } saveOrder() adds the order to the repository (which internally calls on the EntityManager), then passes the Order to the NotificationService to send appropriate notifications (email, SMS). The problem is, while NotificationService needs the order ID to include in the notifications, the Order has no ID yet as it's not been persisted to the DB (the ID is auto generated). The obvious solution seems to pass the EntityManager as a dependency to the OrderService, and right after the repository method, as in the example above. But I've always been reluctant to make the domain Services aware of the EntityManager, preferring to let them talk only to repositories, or other services. What are the drawbacks, if any, of a domain Service having a dependency on the EntityManager? Is there a better alternative?

[/Edit] I have built a reusable workflow with SharePoint Designer 2010. I saved the workflow as template, grab the wsp file, then upload the solution file to the site solutions catalog of another SharePoint farm (based on the same template, same features activated, etc.). After activated the solution, activated the workflow feature, everything works as expected and I can run successfully my workflow. Now I want to uninstall the workflow of the target site. If I deactivate the workflow, the whole site is broken.

When I extract the content of the wsp file, I can see in the file the following definition : I imagine that SharePoint is bit confused, and remove everything defined in the elements.xml.

I would like to make this such that I render only the tiles that are visible to the user and load additional hextiles as the user scrolls (using drag or arrow keys or a pan control). I've the basic idea in my head but I'm looking for help in coming up with a more robust solution that will scale well. What I have in mind and can do right now: a. identify the tiles that need to be loaded to the screen and get the data for rendering them from the server b. when the user drags, figure out the new set of tiles that need to be loaded and get the data and reload the whole screen again. This works but it doesn't give the feeling of scrolling - it essentially suddenly repositions everything. Ideally, I would like to get the feeling of google maps when scrolling this. I've been playing with loading some tiles on the side off the map and only scrolling the underlying canvas when dragging but this doesn't work too well because the canvas runs out... it would be really neat if I had a canvas that behaved like a circular buffer so scrolling in any direction only kept a certain number of tiles in memory and I can continuously scroll in all directions.

It's not, even if will yield : Actually, both are primitive values - which means neither nor can be returned from a constructor function, as both will be converter to an empty object (one has to throw an error to proclaim failure in constructors). They also both evaluate to in boolean contexts. The only real difference I can think of is that one evaluates to , the other to in numeric contexts. So why is there both and if this just confuses programmers who are incorrectly checking for when trying to find out whether a property has been set or not? edit: What I'd like to know is if anyone has a reaosonable example where it's necessary to use which couldn't be expressed using instead. edit2+3: So the general consensus seems to be that means 'there is no such property' while means 'the property does exist, but holds no value'. I could live with that if JavaScript implementations would actually enforce this behaviour - but is a perfectly valid primitive value, so it can easily be assigned to existing properties to break this contract. Therefore, if you want to make sure if a property exists, you have to use the operator or anyway. So once again: what's the practical use for seperate values for and ?

1188220,Set modified date = created date or null on record creation?,"I've been following the convention of adding created and modified columns to most of my database tables. I also have been leaving the modified column as null on record creation and only setting a value on actual modification. The other alternative is to set the modified date to be equal to created date on record creation. I've been doing it the former way but I recent ran into one con which is seriously making me think of switching. I needed to set a database cache dependency to find out if any existing data has been changed or new data added. Instead of being able to do the following: SELECT MAX(modified) FROM customer I have to do this: SELECT GREATEST(MAX(created), MAX(modified)) FROM customer The negative being that it's a more complicated query and slower. Another thing is in file systems I believe they usually use the second convention of setting modified date = created date on creation. What are the pros and cons of the different methods? That is, what are the issues to consider? UPDATE I believe given the apparent trade-offs I'm going to go with modified = created strategy. In addition, I was curious how other web databases handled this and I noticed drupal seems to follow the convention of modified = created also.",[],True

Now the user can updated the clicked named details. e.g. the user clicks on Name1 and changes the address field and then clicks on Name2 and changes the age of Name2. When the user clicks back Name1, the address should be shown updated with the new value and again when the user clicks on Name2, the age should be updated. I have used valueChangeListener to tackle it because I need the old and new value of the changed event. The problem is, as the valueChangeListener is invoked at the end of the VALIDATION phase, I am not getting the updated address of the Name1 field in the valueChangeListener method.

Even if I only archive data on a daily basis, the number of rows will become huge even if only 1 or 2 users make updates on a given day. The next alternative I can think of is only storing entries that have changed. This will mean having to build logic to automatically create a view of a given day. This means less stored rows, but considerable complexity. My final idea is a bit less conventional. Since the historical data will be for reporting purposes, there's no need for web users to have quick access. I'm thinking that my db could have no historical data in it. DB only represents current state. Then, daily, the entire db could be loaded into objects (number of users/data is relatively low) and then serialized to something like XML or JSON. These files could be diffed with the previous day and stored. In fact, SVN could do this for me. When I want the data for a given past day, the system has to retrieve the version for that day and deserialize into objects. This is obviously a costly operation but performance is not so much a concern here. I'm considering using LINQ for this which I think would simplify things. The serialization procedure would have to be pretty organized for the diff to work well. Which approach would you take? Thanks",[],True

I can make any connection I want with IP addresses, I just can't make DNS work.

I have some experience as a developer but am a complete novice when it comes to SQL administration and database design. I'm converting my company's ordering and quoting process from a excel spreadsheet to something a little more robust using an ASP.NET application with a SQL backend. Currently our parts database is just a excel spreadsheet. A lot of our products are just off-the shelf hardware from OEM's like routers, servers etc. We are primarily a software shop so we install our applications on the equipment, configure the network equipment and ship out a complete solution that is installed by our techs. In my schema I have 5 tables CompanyProducts OEMProducts SupplierProducts Suppliers OEMs OEMProdcuts contains information from the equipment manufcaturer like Cisco, for networking equipment or Dell for server equipment. SupplierProducts contains information about the suppliers we get the OEM stuff from (since a lot of OEM's use resellers) companyProducts contains the product ID's specific to our company. Here's a snapshot from SQL Server Management Studio: My question is: What's the best way to setup the primary keys for this simple schema? Should I use an auto-increment field as a GUID as shown in the diagram or the OEMProductID for the primary key to reference in all tables? The Suppliers to SupplierProducts and OEMs to OEMProducts are obvious to me but the rest of the relationships I'm not so sure about. I'm a little worried that if I'll have to refer to OEMProducts by an obscure auto-generated ID when I add data to a table that references it. Since we have more than one supplier for many of the same equipment, I'm not sure how to model that relationship. Thanks for your time.",[],False

I have found that if you link to the version of hosted links, such as jQuery, Gravatar, etc. etc., that it will also work perfectly fine in non-secure connections. However, this does not work the other way around. So, my question is this. Can I just use 1 link (because I don't know if they will be on a secure or insecure connection)? If so, I would like to know that is there a drawback on using the hosted link, instead of the hosted link? If no drawbacks, than wouldn't it just be wiser to use the hosted links if you aren't sure what the user will be using (Secure or insecure connection)? And if that's the case, than why do they even provide insecure connections to hosted links? Why not make them all secure?","['https', 'https', 'http', 'https']",False

When I use the customization window and add columns in the 'Row Area' and 'Data Area' and update the report. The grid generates properly but the graph doesn't generate. However when you add a field in the 'Column Area', the graph then generates. It appears that the graph only generates when there are at least a column specified, even though the 'Data Area' headers is exactly the data we need. I have simulated this with the graph demo you have on your site. Is this expected behavior? Secondly, when I add a DateTime to the 'Row Area' and a String 'Column Area' it's fine. I then swap the columns around, again the pivot is fine.

1538204,gridview sorting: need to re-read every time?,"I'm populating a GridView with code, setting datasource to the dataset returned by a query. So apparently sorting and paging don't just work magically like if I use a datasourceid= some sqldatasource. I've found a number of examples of how to do this on the web, but they all appear to re-execute the query every time. Shouldn't the contents of the query be saved in the view state? Is there some way to just get the previous query results and re-sort without having to go back to the database? (Is it saving all the data in the view state? If so, why can't I get to it? It seems pretty dumb to send it all to the user's browser and send it all back, wasting all the bandwidth, if there's no way to get to it.) Also, if I try to allow paging, it appears I again have to re-execute the query every time the user goes to another page. And if the user sorts and then pages, then I have to remember what the sort order was in a hidden field or some such, so I can re-read the data, re-sort, and then go to the right page.

1733996,Speed up runhaskell,"I have a small test framework. It executes a loop which does the following: Generate a small Haskell source file. Execute this with . The program generates various disk files. Process the disk files just generated. This happens a few dozen times. It turns out that is taking up the vast majority of the program's execution time. On one hand, the fact that manages to load a file from disk, tokenise it, parse it, do dependency analysis, load 20KB more text from disk, tokenise and parse all of this, perform complete type inference, check types, desugar to Core, link against compiled machine code, and execute the thing in an interpreter, all inside of 2 seconds of wall time, is actually pretty damned impressive when you think about it. On the other hand, I still want to make it go faster. ;-) Compiling the tester (the program that runs the above loop) produced a tiny performance difference. Compiling the 20KB of library code that the scripts link against produced a rather more noticeable improvement. But it's still taking about 1 second per invocation of . The generated Haskell files are just over 1KB each, but only one part of the file actually changes. Perhaps compiling the file and using GHC's switch would be faster? Alternatively, maybe it's the overhead of repeatedly creating and destroying many OS processes which is slowing this down? Every invocation of presumably causes the OS to explore the system search path, locate the necessary binary file, load it into memory (surely this is already in the disk cache?), link it against whatever DLLs, and fire it up. Is there some way I can (easily) keep one instance of GHC running, rather than having to constantly create and destroy the OS process? Ultimately, I suppose there's always the GHC API. But as I understand it, that's nightmarishly difficult to use, highly undocumented, and prone to radical changes at every minor point release of GHC. The task I'm trying to perform is only very simple, so I don't really want to make things more complex than necessary. Suggestions? Update: Switching to (i.e., now everything is compiled except the one expression being executed) made no measurable performance difference. It seems pretty clear at this point that it's all OS overhead. I'm wondering if I could maybe create a pipe from the tester to GHCi and thus make use of just one OS process...","['runhaskell', 'runhaskell', 'runhaskell', 'runhaskell', '-e', 'runhaskell', 'GHC -e']",False

1803516,EC2 Apache server giving some old browsers a self signed certificate?,"I bought a wildcard SSL from RapidSSL. It has been working great on my AWS load balancer, but recently, I noticed that the same certificate was not working on our test server which is not on the load balancer when one of our old 2nd generation test iPhones accesses it. This led me to run RapidSSLs certificate checker against our test server. It claimed that the server was returning a self signed certificate which was very puzzling. I checked with another one of RapidSSL's online checkers and got more detailed results showing the self signed certificate. The strange thing is that when you go to the website on the test server on any modern browser, you get the correct certificate and the correct CA certificate as well. I even found another SSL checker on the internet which said everything was fine. I have check, double checked and tripple checked my http.conf file Everything works fine and I don't expect the issue is anything with the cert files.

So at least, we are mapping both 0 and 1 to the same element, and at most we are mapping it to two different elements. But that doesn't really give me anything... Thanks!",[],False

2039827,Only fade in overlay div once all elements have loaded?,"Apologies in the laziness in my query, will try to be more specific. OK- How can I modify the code below so I can guarantee that the fadeIn will only start after all the other actions have been done and all the images in the html have been loaded? Will I need to load the images via js with a callback on each? Some of the code in a $(window).load(). instead of document ready? At the moment the fadeIn is being called asynchronously (I'm guessing) - sometimes it fades .ovwrapper in when an image is still loading. the following is in a document ready at the head of the html loaded by the ajax script. Proposed solution: My solution has been to use the onImagesLoad jquery plugin. Callback from this hides the loading gif and then fades in the .ovwrapper class.

2195124,"When extending Magento's core classes, what XML structure do I need to alter for my changes to take effect?","I am working with a Magento 1.3 (Community Edition) install and I am trying to extend the functionality of one of the core classes. I changed the core file directly on a development server, and got the functionality working there. Now, following Alan Storm's advice, I'm reverting the core files back to stock and implementing my changes in the tree. I've been reading Alan Storm's page and a guide from Josh Pratt, but I can't quite figure out how to apply those examples to my case. The core of the question is - how much of the skeleton of a full-on Magento module do I need to implement in order to extend/monkey-patch core classes? Do I need to create my own namespace? When I name classes, which underscores should I expect to be syntactically significant? When I write the XML, which tags correspond to the class hierarchy and which don't? What other parts of the code will need to be changed to take advantage of my changes, if any? Basically I'd like to not cargo-cult this. The particulars of my scenario: I'm trying to alter the product review functionality of Magento. The code for this functionality lives in . I'm adding an additional step to the server-side validation when new reviews are submitted (our store is having a spam issue, so I'm adding an extra form field, hiding it from humans with CSS, and throwing out reviews that fill in that form field; I'm doing it this way because CAPTCHAs are a sub-optimal UI choice). I added code to postAction() method and to validate() method. I then isolated the added code, put it into and , used the ""class My_Review_Foo extends Mage_Review_Foo"" and ""parent::method"" recommendations from Alan Storm's tutorials. That, predictably, broke the product pages. So I'm working on and trying to figure out how to get Magento to use my classes to extend the core classes. Unfortunately, I can't tell what the underlying logic to the XML is, so I can't figure out how to construct the right XML to tell Magento - ""use my classes instead of the core classes, whenever you would use the core classes."" It looks like pretty much any change to the core classes ends up needing the full pomp and circumstance of a Magento plugin. Is that correct? How much do I actually need to do to shim my changes in, and what's the logic behind doing it that way?","['/app/code/local', '/app/code/core/Mage/Review/', '/app/code/core/Mage/Review/controllers/ProductController.php', '/app/code/core/Mage/Review/Model/Review.php', '/app/code/local/Mage/Review/controllers/ProductController.php', '/app/code/local/Mage/Review/Model/Review.php', '/app/code/local/Mage/Review/etc/config.xml']",False

2232521,Mock the global window object in require.js,"I have a web application that uses window.applicationCache for offline access. All of my code that manages the appCache (eg. checking/updating/swapping the cache) is encapsulated into a ""cache-controller"" object. I have unit tests to test my ""cache-controller"" functions. For testing, I temporarily replace the native window.applicationCache object with my own mock version (since I only want to test my code, not the browsers appCache implementation), eg. A while ago (circa. Chrome 16) this approach worked perfectly. Then Chrome 17, on both Mac &amp; Windows platforms, removed the ability to patch over the browser's default window.applicationCache property (while curiously, it still works fine in Chrome for Linux for all versions up to and including Chrome 26). At the time, I logged a Chromium bug for this; but unfortunately that bug report is still listed as 'unconfirmed'. Anyway, I've just ported my application from traditional 'browser globals' (ie. loading *.js files via script tags; all JS objects are global) to AMD-style modules, using require.js as the module loader. One of the benefits of AMD (or CommonJS) is dependency-injection, where your code gets a local reference to any dependent objects, rather than relying on a global reference, eg. ...which makes it easy to do object mocking, since you can configure the module loader to pass a mock object for 'foo' when in test mode. I had hoped that by moving to dependency-injection, I could get around my applicationCache issue (as the 'window' reference passed into my modules could be either the global window object, or a mock object). However I'm not sure how to have require.js inject 'window' as a dependency into my modules? Is it possible (perhaps using a shim config?) to define a 'window' module; which can then be passed to any code that operates on the global 'window' object? So that I could do something like this: ...where '???' is a module name that refers to the window object. Or would I need to define my own module that exports 'window', which could mapped differently for unit testing, eg.","['window.applicationCache = { /* my appCache mock */ };\n// unit tests run here. Code under test references window.applicationCache.\n', ""require(['foo'], function(Foo) {\n  var bar = new Foo();\n});\n"", ""require(['???'], function(window) {\n  // 'window' here is the real window object, or for testing it's a mock window object\n  window.applicationCache.update();\n});\n"", '// window.js\ndefine(function() {\n  return window;  // real global window object\n});\n\n// window-mock.js\ndefine(function() {\n  return {\n    applicationCache: { /* mock version of appCache */ }\n  }\n});\n\n// for unit testing, remap \'window\' to the mock version\nrequire.config({\n  map: {\n    ""cache-controller"": {\n      ""window"": ""window-mock""\n    }\n  }\n});\n\n// cache-controller.js\nrequire([\'window\'], function(window) {\n  window.applicationCache.update();\n});\n']",False

However, I prefer the extension over a url like ""/pages/about"". Is there a better way to handle this? The issue that occurs when I remove the constraint is that requests to items that don't exist go through the Rails router, which is obviously less than desirable, as that's extra overhead that has to be handled.

2387633,Explanation of how models can differ on $\omega$?,"Assuming set theory (here, ZF) is consistent, there is a model $V$ of ZF, the universe of all sets. So, there is a $\omega^V\in V$. A set $A\in V$ is countable iff a bijection $f\in V$ exists between $A$ and $\omega^V$. By the downward Löwenheim–Skolem Theorem, there is a countable model $M$ of ZFC such that the domain M of $M$ is in $V$ and a bijection $B\in V$ exists between M and $\omega^V$. Since $M$ is a model of ZFC, there must be some $\omega^M\in M$ and some $\omega_1^M\in M$. There is no guarantee that $\omega^M$ is $\omega^V$, and no guarantee that $\omega_1^M$ is $\omega_1^V$. My questions: Can someone explain when/how/why/under what conditions this divergence (between models taking different sets to be $\omega$) happens? When/how/why/under what conditions is there a guarantee that sets will agree on $\omega$?",[],False

I've done this before but it's kinda ugly and requires updating the category model each time an Item changes Some magic SQL incantation in the order clause? Something else?

Given a region $R$, let circle $C_1$ of radius $r_1$ be the largest circle contained in $R$, and let circle $C_2$ of radius $r_2$ be the smallest circle that contains $R$. The fatness of $R$ is given by $\frac{r_2}{r_1}$, and we say that $R$ is $\beta$-fat, for $\beta = \frac{r_2}{r_1}$. For example, if $r_2 = r_1=\frac{1}{2}$, then the regions are unit circles, and there are at 7 circles with diameter at least 1 which can overlap $S$ without overlapping each other.

I got a timeout error on my clients but the mex is correctly answering if I go to the http://myServer/Service1.svc.

Is there any way to figure out what's going on when the services stop answering ? Shouldn't the w3wp.exe processes be closed after the client ends the request ?

2533662,c++ virtual functions,"Just wondering, what would be fastest? If I had a base class like this Then I would have an array of Base like this: Which could contain both Base and it's derivatives. This would be one way of for example, storing various drawing commands. (I know this would seem java-like, but it's just for the example. Classes with just one function doesn't make much sense.) Now alternatively, if I knew exactly what derivatives I would make it could be done like this then an array of Base like before: Base Array[255]; And then create the Draw functions in the derivatives: Now, this solution of course doesn't allow me to just loop through the array and call Draw for each object. Instead it would have to be done something like this. And yeah, to those who have read so far, the actual question. Which would be faster, if you knew the derivatives?

2583784,Reading arbitrarily length messages? How do you know your finished,EDIT! Just read that read will block until the buffer is full. How on earth to I receive smaller packets with out having to send 1MB (my max buffer length) each time? What If I want to send arbitrarily length messages? In Java you seem to be able to just send a char array without any worries. But in C++ with the boost sockets I seem to either have to keep calling until I think I have everything or send my full buffer length of data which seems wasteful. Old original question for context. Yet again boost sockets has me completely stumped. I am using I used the boost SSL example for guidance but I have dedicated a thread to it rather than having the async calls. The first of the socket is fine and it reads all the bytes. After that it reads 1 byte and then all the rest on the next which had me really confused. I then noticed that read_some typically has this behaviour. So I moved to as socket does have a member function read which surprised me. However noticed boost::asio has a read function that takes a socket and buffer. However it is permanently blocking. socket.read_some(...) call to read the rest. What do I need to do make work? note .. I have used wireshark to make sure that the server is not sending the data broken up.

Another was a proposal for a new bug tracking software as opposed to the clearly outdated one we use, and another was a very cool JQuery/Js design that could show the same page to multiple users on different computers and allow each of them to take ""charge"" of the page, disabling the other one from doing anything, and vice versa, seeing all updates in real time -- sort of like Netmeeting through Js.

2648959,OO vs Simplicity when it comes to user interaction,"As a project over summer while I have some downtime from Uni I am going to build a monopoly game. This question is more about the general idea of the problem however, rather than the specific task I'm trying to carry out. I decided to build this with a bottom up approach, creating just movement around a forty space board and then moving on to interaction with spaces. I realised that I was quite unsure of the best way of proceeding with this and I am torn between two design ideas: Giving every space its own object, all sub-classes of a Space object so the interaction can be defined by the space object itself. I could do this by implementing different land() methods for each type of space. Only giving the Properties and Utilities (as each property has unique features) objects and creating methods for dealing with the buying/renting etc in the main class of the program (or Board as I'm calling it). Spaces like go and super tax could be implemented by a small set of conditionals checking to see if player is on a special space. Option 1 is obviously the OO (and I feel the correct) way of doing things but I'd like to only have to handle user interaction from the programs main class. In other words, I don't want the space objects to be interacting with the player. Why? Errr. A lot of the coding I've done thus far has had this simplicity but I'm not sure if this is a pipe dream or not for larger projects. Should I really be handling user interaction in an entirely separate class? As you can see I am quite confused about this situation. Is there some way round this?

2669738,SyncAdapter not being called depending on order of Account setup calls,"I've come across some slightly odd behaviour with my SyncAdapter. The first time I install my app (after uninstalling with adb), it launches and creates an account. Depending on the ordering of some statements (see below), my SyncAdapter's onPerformSync() will never be called; my account under ""Accounts and sync"" shows the ""sync in progress"" icon spinning indefinitely. If I then uncheck the sync checkbox next to my app's account, and then recheck it, my onPerformSync() is called immediately. This causes my SyncAdapter to never be called. ""sync in progress"" icon spins forever, unless I uncheck, then recheck the sync checkbox: With this ordering of the same statements, everything works perfectly: My guess is I'm putting the SyncManager into some inconsistent state due to it firing off a sync request instantly on account creation, and I'm changing its config under its feet. But the (barely coherent) documentation doesn't mention any issues with calling these functions whenever you like.

I'm using as the handler and to animate the width. Here is my code. The code is really really simple and works but with one very odd quirk in Chrome. When animating the elements in and out, the elements ""shake"" as if they're really cold and were shivering.

Is there any explanation for why it occurs and how I can get around it? I'm wondering if it's because I've floated the elements to the right and am animating to the left. The bug is maddening and detracts from the overall presentation a lot (at least to me). Anyone else seen this before?

2915025,"same label along MPLS label switched path, is it possible?","I am a true beginner as far as MPLS is concerned and I was wondering if this would be possible; To be more specific assume a LSP (Label Switched Path) from Host A -&gt; Router 1-&gt; Router 2 -&gt; Router 3 -&gt; Host B Each of the above routers would be a LSR (label switched router) of course having its own LIB (label information base). Now assume that Host A would like to send a packet to B, and assume that the label distribution would take place using plain LDP (Label Distribution Protocol). If I am correct, after signaling has taken place between them, router 3 will decide upon a label, suppose , to accept in its particular interface with router 2 that if a packet has will be forwarded to host B. Similarly, router 2 will set up in its LIB that for this LSP every packet forwarded to router 3 has to leave interface x with a label , and has to let router 1 know that in order to forward a packet in this LSP it has to send it over to it with . Finally, router 1 sets up its LIB in the way that when a packet going to host B enters the MPLS cloud from the interface with Host A,it will be assigned label 2 by Router 1. Therfore, the label path would be ---(No label) -&gt; Label 2 -&gt; Label 1 -&gt; ---(No label) So, my actual question is could Label 1 be the same as Label 2, thus making the most efficient use of labels (using as less as possible)? I am perfectly aware of the fact that you can use 2^20 labels (correct me if I am wrong), but assume that you have to be as efficient as possible for the sake of an exercise. I also know that you can use the same label in the same LIB for different input interfaces (i.e. it is not the label itself that matters but the pair Input Interface &amp; Label that will define how the packet will be forwarded). Any feedback would be very much appreciated. Thank you all for your time.","['Label 1', 'Label 1', 'Label 2', 'Label']",False

2978453,Best way to part answers from solutions?,"Now, if anyone could change the title into something better that would be great =) I am writing a rather long document, which contains plenty of integrals. I have a big list of integrals sorted in a three column style, as pictured below The image is a tad old. Now, I want to link both the soutions and the answers to each question using hyperref. (Where the answer means just the antiderivate, and the solution means all the small steps to compute the integral) My problem is that I do not know what the best way to do this is. Right now, I have turned every integral into a hyperlink, as the MWE shows. Question(s): What is the best way to separate the plain answer, from the solution? (Are any of the ideas below good?) Can one perhaps add a spoiler tag (Opens on click)? Make the numbers into separate links? Add seperate links next to each integral? (I think this would make it very cluttered) Oh, and is there any way to make the hyperref go both ways? That I could click on the answer, and get back to the questions?

2999083,WCF communication with several clients without IIS,"Hey, we're working on a peer to peer comm software that would allow a number of grocery stores to sync their inventory with what we call ""headquarters"". To so this, we're thinking WCF+WPF, and no IIS and web services. My experience with WCF is basically zero, so my question is whether a TCP comm solution using WCF would work. The data that's being transferred is quite limited, about 2MB for a compressed plain text file (so we're sending binary data!), and this is done once per day only. So bandwidth/load shouldn't be an issue here. The idea at this point is to have a WCF ""server"" running at HQ. Stores make themselves known to that server and then send files back and forth (simliliar to a chat application). What I'm not sure of: does every store need to have a WCF ""server"" (or endpoint)? How would the server (=HQ) send a file to one of the clients (=stores)? Every store can send a file to any other store, and the HQ, and every store can also ""request"" a file from any other store/HQ. Two limitations: None of the machines/computers involved can run Windows server for budget reasons, and as stated before IIS is a no-go.",[],False

3103609,How to find $u$ and $v$ for $(xu-yv)+i(xv+yu)=1$?,"I'm reading Beardon's Algebra and Geometry. To find the multiplicative inverse $z^{\small -1}$ of a complex number $z$ we adopt a common strategy in mathematics, namely we first assume that the inverse exists and then find an explicit expression for it. It is then quite legitimate to start with this expression (which does exist) and then verify that it has the desired properties. Given the complex number $z=x+iy$, then, we assume that $z^{\small -1}$ exists, write $z^{\small -1}=u+iv$, and then impose the condition $zz^{\small -1}$=1. This yields: $$(xu-yv)+i(xv+yu)=1\tag{1}$$ so that $xu-yv=1$ and $xv+yu=0$. Thus $u=\frac{x}{x^2+y^2}$ and $v=\frac{-y}{x^2+y^2}$. So, for any non-zero $z$, say $z=x+iy$ (where $x^2+y^2\neq 0$), we define $$ z^{\small -1}=\frac{x}{x^2+y^2}+i \left(\frac{-y}{x^2+y^2}\right)=\frac{x-iy}{x^2+y^2}\tag{2}$$ It is now easy to verify that $zz^{\small -1}=1=z^{\small -1}z$, so that $z^{\small -1}$ is indeed the multiplicative inverse of $z$; thus every non-zero complex number has a multiplicative inverse. He made $u=\frac{x}{x^2+y^2}$ and $v=\frac{-y}{x^2+y^2}$, I used that and checked that it is true but the process he used to such $u$ and $v$ is unknown to me. How to do that or how's the name of it?",[],False

We were able to mitigate this problem to some extent by discarding some frames, i.e. calling 2-3 times and discarding the results. 2) The second issue is when we timed different parts of the application, we found that clearing the buffer (calling 2-3 times and not using the results) takes about 65ms and then this line: takes about 80ms. These two parts take the biggest chunk of processing time, our actual processing takes just about 20-30ms more. Is there a faster way (a) to clear the buffer (b) to capture the frame?

When I use the adapter from EJB, the server creates a new ManagedConnection, begins a new transaction, commits it, but does not call the method and does not put it back to the pool.

The Server creates a new ManagedConnection instance first 10 times and then the connection pool reaches its maximal capacity. It is clear from tracing the logs that no single call of occurs and every connection in the pool is busy.

The SQL code works fine with admin level privledges, but for obvious reasons I'm not letting the ASP.NET account have server admin level. I have set up a SQL account that the ASP.NET C# code uses to log in, and the permissions for everything else are fine. (Read access only for the specific databases it uses.) I can't figure out what to give it access to in order to have access to read this specific dynamic management view. Would appreciate suggestions using either Management Studio, or using a SQL statement. This appears to have related information on the view in question: sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats (Transact-SQL)","['GRANT', ""DECLARE @lastupdate datetime\n     SELECT @lastupdate = last_user_update from sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats\n     WHERE OBJECT_ID = OBJECT_ID('MissingReport')\n\nSELECT \n    COALESCE(Creator, 'Total') AS 'Creator',\n    COUNT(*) AS Number, \n    '$' + CONVERT(varchar(32), SUM(Cost), 1) AS 'Cost' \n    FROM MissingReport \n    WHERE NOT( \n        [bunch of conditions that make something exempt from needing a report]\n        OR\n        (\n            DATEDIFF(day,ReleaseDt,@lastupdate) &lt;= 3\n        )\n    )\n    GROUP BY Creator WITH ROLLUP\n""]",False

3275580,Real Positive Zeros of Equation,"During my research on physical problem, I faced the following simple equation: $r^{2k+1}+ab\,r-a=0$ With: $-1\leq k\leq1\:,\:0&lt;r\:,\: a,b\in\mathbb{R}$ I need to put bounders on $a,b,k$ such that this equation will have always at least one positive root, also I need to find some rough upper &amp; lower boundary estimation for this positive zero. We see that if $b=0$ it will be very easy to solve it, anyway this zero will not give us an upper estimation because $ab$ can be positive as much as negative. Also I thought of putting : $k=\frac{m}{n}\:,\: m,n\in\mathbb{Z}\:,\: m\leqslant n\:$ and we get the polynomial: $z^{2m+n}+ab\,z^{n}-a=0\:,\: z=\sqrt[n]{r}$ And using Descartes' Sign Rule tells us only that there will be no positive roots at all only when $a,b&lt;0$ , that's not very useful for me. So my question is if you can think of any additional tricks/transforms to extract this conditions and the upper bound? also I'm wondering if there is any argumentation on checking the behavior of the polynomial roots (As I did above) and suppose that it will be also true for $k\in\{-1,1\}/\mathbb{\mathbb{Q}}$ ?",[],False

3407792,"fast, large-width, non-cryptographic string hashing in python","I have a need for a high-performance string hashing function in python that produces integers with at least 34 bits of output (64 bits would make sense, but 32 is too few). There are several other questions like this one on Stack Overflow, but of those every accepted/upvoted answer I could find fell in to one of a few categories, which don't apply (for the given reason.) Use the built-in function. This function, at least on the machine I'm developing for (with python 2.7, and a 64-bit cpu) produces an integer that fits within 32 bits - not large enough for my purposes. Use hashlib. hashlib provides cryptographic hash routines, which are far slower than they need to be for non-cryptographic purposes. I find this self-evident, but if you require benchmarks and citations to convince you of this fact then I can provide that. Use the function as a prototype to write your own function. I suspect this will be the correct way to go, except that this particular function's efficiency lies in its use of the c_mul function, which wraps around 32 bits - again, too small for my use! Very frustrating, it's so close to perfect! An ideal solution would have the following properties, in a relative, loose order of importance. Have an output range extending at least 34 bits long, likely 64 bits, while preserving consistent avalanche properties over all bits. (Concatenating 32-bit hashes tends to violate the avalanche properties, at least with my dumb examples.) Portable. Given the same input string on two different machines, I should get the same result both times. These values will be stored in a file for later re-use. High-performance. The faster the better as this function will get called roughly 20 billion times during the execution of the program I'm running (it is the performance-critical code at the moment.) It doesn't need to be written in C, it really just needs to outperform md5 (somewhere in the realm of the built-in hash() for strings). Accept a 'perturbation' (what's the better word to use here?) integer as input to modify the output. I put an example below (the list formatting rules wouldn't let me place it nearer.) I suppose this isn't 100% necessary since it can be simulated by perturbing the output of the function manually, but having it as input gives me a nice warm feeling. Written entirely in Python. If it absolutely, positively needs to be written in C then I guess that can be done, but I'd take a 20% slower function written in python over the faster one in C, just due to project coordination headache of using two different languages. Yes, this is a cop-out, but this is a wish list here. 'Perturbed' hash example, where the hash value is changed drastically by a small integer value n Finally, if you're curious as to what the heck I'm doing that I need such a specific hash function, I'm doing a complete re-write of the pybloom module to enhance its performance considerably. I succeeded at that (it now runs about 4x faster and uses about 50% of the space) but I noticed that sometimes if the filter got large enough it was suddenly spiking in false-positive rates. I realized it was because the hash function wasn't addressing enough bits. 32 bits can only address 4 billion bits (mind you, the filter addresses bits and not bytes) and some of the filters I'm using for genomic data double that or more (hence 34 bit minimum.)

I do not know whether the questioners actually use the posted codes on their apps or not. If they are then, unless the activity is portrait or landscape only, they should show the dialog by using showDialog(int id).

3584162,How to get access to MusicTracks in a MusicSequence?,"So, I'm trying to figure out the MusicPlayer API for iOS. I have been able to get a MIDI to play, so my sequence is there and populated with something useful but I can't seem to get access to the tracks (or in this case track, as there is only one music track, the other is a tempo track). If I run a MusicSequenceGetTrackCount on ""mySequence"" I get a return of 2; this is expected. If I run a MusicSequenceGetInfoDictionary, it returns 3 entries: This makes sense since all of this info matches up with my track. So, all of this would make me think if I use the method MusicSequenceGetIndTrack(MusicSequence inSequence, UInt32 inTrackIndex, MusicTrack *outTrack) I should be able to output the track so I can make some modification. Here's my code so far. If anyone could take a look and see where I'm going wrong, that'd be great. Also, if anyone has some good resources about using MusicPlayer, I'd be really grateful. Thanks.

3585273,wcf deserializing without memory allocations,"I have a WCF service handling a very large number of requests (thousands per second). Each request contains objects, so they get built inside the DataContractSerializer during deserialization. My service processes the messages, and they get cleaned up by the .net garbage collector. The problem is that garbage collections are causing problems for my service (requests occasionally taking 100+ milliseconds longer than they should). I need to minimize them. So I am looking for a way of using object pooling. In other words, I want the data contract serializer to obtain an object from my object pool (instead of getting one via GetUninitializedObject), and then when I am done processing the message, I would release it back to the pool for cleaning &amp; reuse, thereby avoiding thousands of memory allocations a second. I've seen this is possible with protobuf-net (Using protobuf-net, is it possible to deserialize a message without allocating memory?) and in fact I'm using protobuf elsewhere, but for this particular situation that is not an option",[],False

In the domain some classes have collections of children. Some children reference their parent. The problem with the is when a request is made to the server for a child object, all other children are returned with the response. In many circumstances it's very helpful to have access to the parent object from the child and I would prefer not to have to make a seperate request for the parent since that would result in more round trips. Normally Nhibernates Lazy-Loading would take care of this but the interaction with protobuf-net (or any other serialization) means all the fields are accessed to be serialised. The client has no direct access to the database. Is it possible to limit the object reference depth in either protobuf-net or Nhibernate in such a way that I can include in the request to the server a flag saying don't load more than 2 objects deep. e.g. Order - Order Item - Delivery Information. A limit of one on a request for an order would mean don't load the delivery information. A limit of 0 would mean don't load the order items. Altenatively is it possible to optionally stop references being loaded (the limit is either 0 or unlimited) this is more restrictive but possibly more viable to implement.",[],False

3931776,Java Multithreaded Client/Server Communication Trouble,"I'm writing a server-client chat program. The server proper waits for an incoming connection and creates a thread(IdentThread) to authenticate the user (asking username and password). Upon confirming the user's identity the IdentThread creates a ChatThread that handles user inputs and sends messages to other users and the client it is associated with. The client program reads from the command line via a Buffered Reader, messages are sent to the server using a PrintWriter and messages are received using another BufferedReader. This model works well enough. However, when a user disconnects and then reconnects, they pass through the IdentThread well enough, but upon entering the ChatThread, none of the messages from the server or other users are visible. The only cure that I have found is to restart the server program, which is infeasible for practical usage. The server starts a new IdentThread, passing it the socket, having it accept on the socket and starting it. The IdentThread creates a new BufferedReader and PrintWriter to handle in the I/O. These work all time time, no matter how many times a client connects and disconnects. After passing authentication, the IdentThread creats a ChatThread, passing it the socket, username, ID number of the user, the BufferedReader and the PrintWriter. This is where I run into problems. After a user has connected and disconnected once, they can no longer read any of the messages sent by the server to them, though they could read messages from the IdentThread. Messages sent by the user are visible to other users and the server properly responds to commands sent by the user. I'm not sure if the problem is caused by the fact that I never have anything bind to a socket, by the way I'm having communications work or some other issue that I don't know about. Edit: I cropped up some of my code and I've brought in the parts that deal with the communication.

To do this it creates a byte array of the message. The problem is that there are MANY (~50) different message formats, each one defined in VB6 as a user-defined type. For example. (LNG4 and INT2's are custom types) Running the VB6 code through an automated translation tool I get a C# struct: But the old VB6 code copied these to the byte array with an LSet. This depended on the assumption that the types represented a contiguous block of memory. But in C# the way stuff is laid-out by the compiler in memory is supposed to a be an implementation detail not accessible to the programmer. So what's the best way to get the contents of these different structs into a byte array?

From Wikipedia. I understand the outer loop is logV since you're joining sets. But then comes the internal loop. If you use equivalence relations to keep track of the sets, that means you're only getting the element representing the set, so you can't determine the edge with the smallest weight between the two sets because you don't have all the elements. If you modify the structure to hold references to the children you still have to get all the children of each set. That means, worse case scenario, O(V/2) = O(V) for each set. Afterwards, you still have to find the smallest edge connecting the two, which means going over all the edges connecting the two components. So you need to iterate over each node and see if its edge connects to an element in the other component, and if it does, if it's smaller than the minimum edge you currently have. Meaning, an outer loop to iterate over the nodes and an inner loop to iterate over that nodes' edges - O(V*E). Since it's inside an O(logV) loop, you get O(logV*V*E). Now, it seems as if you just have to iterate through all the edges, but how would you choose the minimum edge between the 2 components? I can tell if a given edge connects nodes in different components, but I can't tell which one connecting them has minimum weight. And if I get the one with the minimum weight, it might not connect them.",[],False

4086358,Is denormalization more efficient in this case?,"For more clarification please look my for older post here Database normalization - who&#39;s right? I appreciate those nice answers, but I want to emphasize that this system that we are making is not just for the purpose of learning. It is a true enrollment system for our school. We started about four months ago and the system went alright except for the confusion about denormalization. Like I said, his reasons are: 1. The queries may be deleted accidentally, thus making more problems. He said 2nd normal form is enough, as he did in all his systems from his past experience. People (with not enough technical knowledge) working with us cannot make queries they wanted out of from tables with not enough attributes/rows.(in my case, I decided to remove the total units because that can be easily computed from the other attributes.) Other systems such as accounting, payroll, inventory and purchasing are planned to integrate with the enrollment system. If that is the case, he said, it is good to connect each new systems database to our enrollment system database directly, without accessing the queries. He argued that all dependent rows, such as the computed average grades of each student must also be included in tables, because what we need, he said, is the physical data, not to be recomputed by means of views. More importantly, I guess, is that he wanted every transactions to be entered in the database. As in the case of debit and credit for the purpose of balancing transactions. In my case, from what Ive heard from him, he doesn't mention anything about the speed except making queries fom queries(which I believe the main reason why we need to denormalize). He simply wants everything documented in the database. My position is in the contrary of all of these. If accuracy is our concern over the speed, Normalization is perfect, by the way we are using microsoft sql server. One last thing, I remembered he wanted to include the full_name column in the students_info table. His reason? He said ""It is better to read from table than making another query. Just make sure the program can control the user input for the full_name"". Before I decide to discontinue making this system, please let me know from you, more experienced people.",[],True

Details I am switching an API project from using the built-in .NET to using Json.NET to generate JSON. In Json.NET, for a UTC , the default datetime serialization was similar to the .NET version: For non-UTC, unlike , Json.NET appends a timezone offset to the results (-6 for my area, this time of year): Here is the code I am using to switch Json.NET 4.5+ back to the format (called ): The solution seemed like it would be as simple as telling Json.NET to use a different setting. I have tried every setting for (, , , and ) and they all maintain the ""-0600"" in the output. In fact, they all produce identical results for a non-UTC . Caveat Ideally, I would have all my times in UTC already. I certainly plan to do so with the next version of this API.

4273153,Very random BSODs and BIOS hangs,"I get BSODs after the computer runs for anywhere from a minute to a couple of hours. I have had the problem for some days now, and it has become progressively worse. Sometimes, it hangs on the boot screen, and sometimes it BSODs or just reboots before Windows has started. The BSODs are most often of the kind or (I have not seen any other). Windbg reveals that a different .sys file is responsible every time. I've run HD Tune and Memtest, both with unremarkable results. A clean install of the video card driver didn't help. A diagnostic/recovery type tool (I don't remember the name) sometimes starts after a BSOD, but it always induces another BSOD. Safety mode (with network) seems to be unaffected (no BSODs), but it did hang once when starting up in safety mode. What could this possibly be, and what more can I do to diagnose it? Could it be an OS, or driver error when it sometimes hangs on BIOS? How can I find faulty hardware without buying new components and switching them? The computer is self-built with all new components in February this year. I run Windows 7 Pro. EDIT: I checked the temperatures now. In the BIOS menu, the CPU temp. was 25-30C, then in Speedfan it was suddenly 85-90C, so I spent some time remounting the fan and dusting and stuff, but nothing changed. Incidentally, 30C is 86F, can Speedfan be reading it wrong? Can the CPU temperature jump 55 degrees in the minute it takes to boot, and then cool back down in the time it takes to reboot? EDIT 2: HMonitor gives correct readings for CPU temperature, around 30C. Another temperature (CPU2 in HMonitor, AUX in Speedfan) reads in the 50s, but that shouldn't be a problem. I'm still curious as to what types of problems cause the BIOS/POST sequence to hang. Gonna try malware scan next.","['IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL', 'DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL']",False

4297905,Android Layout fade messes up buttons,"I have an layout with about 3 ""sub-layouts"" which are LinearLayouts that I set to be either isible or gone. Inside all of the layouts there are buttons that I want to switch in between. I use the layout fade animation which just fades the alpha to zero and does the magic between layouts. I set a fade on each buttonpress to another layout and to not mess up everything I have to disable all buttons on the other layouts that aren't showing. The weird thing is that it works fine when switching from the menu to another layout for options but when going to a third view I can briefly see a flash of the options view, then when going back to the menu then the buttons do not work if I'm not spamming them for occational button press recognition. Theres alot of code that isn't doing much but heres some: Thats pretty much what I do at each buttonpress, one thing to note is that I'm using only one class to handle all the buttonpresses from each layout. mainF is an view for the menu layout and optionsF is for the options layout. The setMenuBtns and optionsBtns is simply a function for button.setEnabled(enabled) and the input for each button in that layout. This is the fade animation: What I'm thinking is that if theres a limit for how many layouts one layout can handle or if the animation code needs changing. If you do not understand please ask and if you need any more code I can post it here. Thanks :) EDIT: I just tested by removing the animations and it fixed the menu buttons not working but how can that cause it? I set the menu buttons to be enabled when switching to the menu layout?

4383083,jQuery Binding & JavaScript event.stopPropagation(),"I have a TD that contains two divs. The first div contains text and is visible. The second div contains a textarea and is hidden by default. Using the code below, I've bound to the click event of the TD and swapped the visibility of the div's on click: Although this works, it created an issue with the textarea. When I attempted to put the focus on the textarea after it became visible, the div's would swap visibility again (because I'm bound to the click event of the TD). So, my solution, stop the event propagation: This works - sort of. I'm able to freely edit and click inside the textarea now, but I'm not able to range select any text (I'm assuming because of the jQuery above). It's possible that my assumption is incorrect, because I'm unable to range select text via the keyboard as well (shift + end or shift + home). Any thoughts / suggestions?

Then, if I understand this correctly, $$d_{\textbf a} f(\textbf u) = \nabla f(\textbf a) \cdot \textbf u = (1,1)\cdot (2,1) = 2+1 = 3,$$ where $\nabla f(\textbf a) = (\partial f/\partial x, \partial f/\partial y)$. But what if my assignment is to calculate $d_{\textbf a} f$? I don't know what it means. Do they want me to calculate $d_{\textbf a} f(x,y) = (1,1)\cdot (x,y) = x+y$, or something else?

4596176,Finding a maximal square from a finite set of tiles (approximation),"I have a final set of tiles in which every edge can have on of four colors. The task is to find a maximal possible square build from a given set (finite) of this tiles. Tiles can be rotated. I need to design 3 algorithms for finding a solution for this task. One complete and two aproximations. Obviously it is my task for Algorithms class so Im not asking about complete solutions (as this would be unfair) but for some directions. Im already designed a kind of complete algorithm (using backtracking - search for a square of size sqrt(n) - if it could not be found try finding smaller and so on) but I have no idea how to create aproximation algorithms. I think one will be kind of stupid which will find a good answer only in specific cases just to document that it is not a good aproach but still I need one much faster then backtracking and quite good one. Also is this problem NP-hard one? My backtracking algorithm is exponential one but it doesnt mean that there cannot be a better one... EDIT: I have complete algorithm with exponential time, could some one give me some hints how to build some kind of aproximation for this problem with polynomial time or something better then exponential? EDIT2: I have the idea that this problem can be changed to a problem of reducting a graph to square grid graph ( http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GridGraph.html ). Still there is a problem if the tiles can be arranged in such a way to build a grid, but this could be a good point to start. Are there any, for example, greedy or any other aproximation algorithms for reducting graph to square-grid graph?",[],False

4706269,The consistency of PA is falsifiable. Can the same be said of its soundness?,"The statement that 'PA is consistent' is absolutely falsifiable (a term I just made up), in the sense that if it is false, then we can demonstrate its falseness independently of any metatheory (just deduce a contradiction within PA). Can something similar be said of the statement that 'PA is sound'? I think not, because to even make sense of the claim that PA is sound, we need a metatheory (although see here). Clarification. Let me attempt to clarify what I mean by ""absolutely falsifiable."" If we're given a formal system with a recursively ennumerable set of axioms, then if someone claims that ""the string $\phi$ is not deducible in the system,"" well this is a falsifiable claim. In the sense that, if the claim is false, in other words if $\phi$ is deducible in the system, then we can verify this within the rules of the system, simply by deducing $\phi$. For instance, if I claim that ""ZFC cannot prove that the Ackermann function is defined for all inputs,"" well this is falsifiable: because, if it is a falsehood, then you can confirm that its a falsehood by using ZFC to prove that the Ackermann function is, in fact, defined for all inputs. In fact, since its already known that ZFC proves that the Ackermann function is total, you already know the claim is a falsehood. On the other hand, if I simply claim that ""the Ackermann function is not defined for all inputs"" without reference to a foundational system, well this is a more problematic claim. If its true, we can never confirm this, because we have to check infinitely many inputs to make sure the program halts. If its false, then for some input, we'll have to wait an infinite amount of time before we can verify that, indeed, its not going to halt. So the claim that ""the Ackermann function is not defined for all inputs"" is not falsifiable (and neither is its negation).",[],False

(instead of 300) That's too low to be readable by the user, I fear.

Answer: The PDF renderer in Reporting Services 2005 resizes all images that it is given at 96 DPI no matter what DPI the image is when you pass it to the renderer. That means that a 300 DPI image or even a 600 DPI image will be sized in the PDF as if it is only 96 DPI. In other words, your high DPI image may render larger than expected. Despite sizing the images as if they were 96 DPI, the PDF renderer appears to render higher DPI images at a higher quality than 96 DPI. Even if the sizing being wrong, the image actually is rendering at a higher quality. A necessary workaround is to size the image to the proper number of inches based on 96 DPI calculations. Then use Bitmap.SetResolution to set the images to at least 300 DPI. That may provide a higher quality image that is the proper number of pixels to fit properly in the report. But I don't know how to use that Bitmap.SetResolution, I'm using the classic report viewer web control and I need really a fully functional pdf export.

I recently created an SDL application, using threading and OpenGL. I have one thread running in a loop, which continually updates the state of the objects I draw to the screen. The states are very simple, it is just a boolean array (when the array value is true, I draw it, when it is false, I don't). Currently, I have no mutex lock on any of my variables and everything is working just fine. Even if only half of the state array was updated between a draw, the framerate is much higher (or at least equal to) the update rate, so it would be acceptable to have a half-updated state. Now, I initially started working on a similar idea to this on an embedded system using interrupts. Every once in a while, an interrupt would trigger, update the state array, and the execution would continue. Now that I'm on a multi-core desktop, and updating the array simultaneously, I'm wondering why nothing bad is happening, since I am technically reading and writing to the same memory location at the same time. Is it just by chance, or is there a reason there's no memory access violations happening? If it is acceptable for the state of the variable to change just before, during, or just after the value is used, should I bother using a mutex lock? Thank you for your help.

4789412,Securely connect to External DB via Java Desktop Application (External DB Credentials),"after hours of searching around, I just couldn't find a complete answer to my question. My question is: How can a Desktop Application (I'm using Java but this is global question) connect to an External DB securely and that means, without 1) hard-coding the DB credentials or 2) storing them in a file (encrypted or not) or 3) calling a server function to establish a connection A possible answer would be encrypting the actual code files (?) to avoid de-compilation in the case of hard-coding the DB credentials - and I dont know if thats still secure... Example of such application to better explain myself: User accesses the application (Possible user authentication with LOCAL Application DB but that's irrelevant) then through the application access the Web Server and Web DB with all standard actions like select/update/delete through given menu options.

4801156,Differential operator acting on the eigenfunctions of a commuting operator,"I am reading an article at the moment and there is one step that I am having trouble understanding. The article proves that if $P$ and $Q$ are commuting differential operators there is a non-trivial polynomial $f(s,t)$ such that $f(P,Q)=0$. In order to to this it considers the eigenvalue problem $Py=Ey$ for any number $E$. This problem has $n$ ($n$ being the order of $P$) linearly independent solutions by basic existence and uniqueness theorem. These span a space, $V_E$. The article takes as a basis of this space the solutions $y_i$ with $\frac{d^j y_i}{dx^j}(0)=\delta_{ij}$. If $Q$ commutes with $P$ then $Q$ maps $V_E$ into itself. Now the article claims, and this is the step I do not understand, that the matrix elements will be polynomials in $E$. Anyone who can explain this will get my gratitude. Edit: The article I am reading is ""Methods of algebraic geometry in the theory of non-linear equations"" by Krichever in Russian Math Surveys 32, 1977 . The operators the article studies are ordinary differential operators acting on $C^\infty(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C})$. Operators are assumed to have constant leading coefficient. (So $P=\sum_{i=0}^n a_i x^i$ where $a_n$ is a non-zero constant.) The theorem is Theorem 2.1 on page 9 of the pdf. It is specifically the second sentence of the proof that I have problems with. I know that there actually is such a polynomial as claimed in the article as I know algebraic proofs of this fact. I am however trying to understand the analytic proof given by Krichever.",[],False

The immediate solution appears to be to create the function as a variable and then pass it into the initial click creation and into the binding event. Like so: This, for one reason or another, seems to be causing browser crashing issues. Is it not possible to pass a function as a var in this case or am I just doing it wrong? Alternatively, is there a better way to achieve the results I'm looking for?

5003691,Indexing arrays with enums in C#,"I have a lot of fixed-size collections of numbers where each entry can be accessed with a constant. Naturally this seems to point to arrays and enums: The problem with this is of course that you cannot use an enum to index an array without a cast (though the compiled IL is using plain ints). So you have to write this all over the place: I have tried to find ways to use the same easy syntax without casting but haven't found a perfect solution yet. Using a dictionary seems to be out of the question since I found it to be around 320 times slower than an array. I also tried to write a generic class for an array with enums as index: or even a variant with a second generic parameter specifying the enum. This comes quite close to what I want but the problem is that you cannot just cast an unspecific enum (be it from a generic parameter or the boxed type Enum) to int. Instead you have to first box it with a cast to object and then cast it back. This works, but is quite slow. I found that the generated IL for the indexer looks something like this: As you can see there are unnecessary box and unbox instructions there. If you strip them from the binary the code works just fine and is just a tad slower than pure array access. Is there any way to easily overcome this problem? Or maybe even better ways? I think it would also be possible to tag such indexer methods with a custom attribute and strip those two instructions post-compile. What would be a suitable library for that? Maybe Mono.Cecil? Of course there's always the possibility to drop enums and use constants like this: which may be the fastest way since you can directly access the array.","['enum StatType {\n    Foo = 0,\n    Bar\n    // ...\n}\n\nfloat[] stats = new float[...];\nstats[StatType.Foo] = 1.23f;\n', 'stats[(int)StatType.foo] = 1.23f;\n', 'public sealed class EnumArray&lt;T&gt;\n{\n    private T[] array;\n    public EnumArray(int size)\n    {\n        array = new T[size];\n    }\n    // slow!\n    public T this[Enum idx]\n    {\n        get { return array[(int)(object)idx]; }\n        set { array[(int)(object)idx] = value; }\n    }\n}\n', '.method public hidebysig specialname instance !T get_Item(!E idx) cil managed\n{\n    .maxstack 8\n    L_0000: ldarg.0 \n    L_0001: ldfld !0[] EnumArray`2&lt;!T, !E&gt;::array\n    L_0006: ldarg.1 \n    L_0007: box !E\n    L_000c: unbox.any int32\n    L_0011: ldelem.any !T\n    L_0016: ret \n}\n', 'static class StatType {\n    public const int Foo = 0;\n    public const int Bar = 1;\n    public const int End = 2;\n}\n']",False

5065550,Converting average response times to a summable node-set,"I've been running a series of webservice tests in JMeter, and what I'd like to do is take the total sum of the average response times returned by each test. I have a way to find the average response times for each test, but no way to add the averages from the tests together. I am aware that in order to use XPath's sum() function the values need to be a part of a node-set, but from what I understand once I find the average values out of the XML they are no longer part of one. So I need to use the node-set() function, but I am fairly new to XSLT/XPath and am unsure how to get things working. Any help with this is appreciated! This is a sample XML from JMeter running with two iterations: This is an exerpt in my XSLT where the averages from each test are found.

5176460,Interesting integral some how related to $\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}x\ln(\sin(x))dx$,"I hope I used the correct tag (definite integral). I ran across an integral that is rather tough and I am wondering if anyone could give me a shove in the right direction. $\displaystyle\int_{0}^{1}\frac{\tanh^{-1}(x)\ln(x)}{x(1-x^{2})}\text{ d}x=\frac{-7}{16}\zeta(3)-\frac{{\pi}^{2}}{8}\ln(2)$ This solution is almost exactly like the solution to $\displaystyle \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}x\ln(\sin(x))\text{ d}x$, which is $\displaystyle \frac{7}{16}\zeta(3)-\frac{{\pi}^{2}}{8}\ln(2)$ I solved the latter integral by using the identity $\displaystyle -\ln(\sin(x))-\ln(2)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{\cos(2kx)}{k}$, then integrating: $\displaystyle -\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}x\ln(\sin(x))\text{ d}x-\frac{{\pi}^{2}}{8}\ln(2)=\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}x\cos(2x)\text{ d}x+\frac{\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\cos(4x)\text{ d}x}{2}+\frac{\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\cos(6x)}{3}\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot$ But, $\displaystyle \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}x\cdot \cos(2kx)\text{ d}x=-\left(\frac{1+(-1)^{k+1}}{(2k)^{2}}\right)$ Thus: $\displaystyle \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}x\ln(\sin(x))\text{ d}x=\frac{1}{4}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1+(-1)^{k+1}}{k^{3}}-\frac{{\pi}^{2}}{8}\ln(2)$ $\displaystyle =\frac{1}{2}\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(2k+1)^{3}}-\frac{{\pi}^{2}}{8}\ln(2)$ and so on. Which results in the solution I mentioned in the beginning. Sorry for all that, but I wanted to show you what I was using in order to some how relate it to the integral I am wanting to solve. I have been trying and trying to relate the aforementioned $\displaystyle \tanh$ integral with this one. The solutions are so nearly the same, I figured there has to be a way to relate them and solve the integral. Does anyone have some ideas?. I have tried the identity $\displaystyle \tanh^{-1}(x)=\frac{1}{2}\left[\ln(1+x)-\ln(1-x)\right]$, then breaking it up: Resulting in $\displaystyle \frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{1}\frac{\ln(x)\ln(1+x)}{x(x^{2}-1)}\text{ d}x-\frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{1}\frac{\ln(x)\ln(1-x)}{x(x^{2}-1)} \text{ d}x$, then I used the various series representations for $\displaystyle \ln(1+x)$, $\displaystyle \frac{1}{1-x^{2}}$, etc. I tried double integrals, but I always get stuck. I even broke it up per partial fraction expansion, but several of the resulting integrals were still nasty. Does anyone have some clever ideas?.",[],False

I don't want it completed for me, but get me started in the right direction. I'm mostly unsure of the recursive part of the program. I'm not very good at programming. problem: NorthEast paths are obtained from a two-dimensional grid by moving up and right. For example, in the figure below, there are two paths from 1,0 to 0,1. The first is (1,0), (0,0), (0,1), the second is (1,0), (1,1), (0,1). Note that there are no NorthEast paths from (0,1) to any other point. Also note that there is one NorthEast path from (1,1) to (0,1). You are to write a program that takes a number (size of grid - no larger than 10) and a starting location and an ending location and recursively computes all of the ""NorthEast"" paths. 0,0 0,1 1,0 1,1 I'm reading in the file prog2.dat which reads in the grid size first and then the starting coordinates and then finishing coordinates. for example: 5 3 0 1 3 It needs to be one files, so I'm going to use methods.

5191321,Non-interesting numbers via resource-bounded properties?,"There is an old joke about the smallest non-interesting number being interesting in itself (I have heard it attributed to Richard Hamming). This is then used to justify the argument that every number must be interesting. I have always found this induction unsatisfactory. Here is an attempt at a more precise argument. Consider a set of rules, represented as sentences of some logic. The interesting numbers are then the smallest numbers that are models of some set of sentences. In first-order logic each natural number can be distinguished from every other one, so the sentences true for any natural number will differ from those true for any other, and every number will be interesting. Now suppose our rules are given in terms of a bounded model of computation, so that only finite sets of properties can be associated with each number, and so that every property can be checked with a bounded amount of some resource (for instance, time or space). Is every number still interesting with resource-bounded properties? Edit: to clarify, resource bounds is my focus here. With unbounded resources this devolves into a question about definability and large ordinals, as discussed by Aaron and Kaveh. The idea is that each interesting number should be definable by a sentence that can be checked given a bounded amount of resources. (It might also make sense to allow some finite set of sentences as separate building blocks instead of making them into single sentences via conjunction.)",[],False

(Join and meet.) The ideals of a ring form a modular lattice. So do submodules of a module. These facts are easy to prove, but I have never seen any striking examples of their utility. Actually, in a seminar I took part in, the speaker said the modularity condition wasn't very natural and that there was an ongoing search for better ones (this was in the context of the Gabriel dimension and its generalization to lattices -- unfortunately, I didn't understand much of that). I would like to see some motivation for this notion. That is, I would like to know when it is useful, and if it is natural. At the moment, it doesn't look any more natural to me than any random condition in the language of lattices. If you could shed some light on the opinion I quote in the previous paragraph, it would be very helpful as well.

5329582,"In Gnutella,how does PUSH work through a firewall or NAT box?","I am trying to understand more about how the Gniutella P2P protocol works. I have read GnuFU and the latest protocol specification I can find (0.4), but I have some questions about how PUSH works through a firewall or NAT box. Case 1: Alice is connected to the Internet through a NAT box or firewall. She sees that Bob has a file she wants to download. Bob does not have a firewall. So Alice's client opens a TCP connection to Bob's machine and downloads the file. No problem. Case 2: Same as #1 except that Bob wants to get a file from Alice. Bob's client cannot open a TCP connection to Alice's computer because it is behind a firewall. From what I have read, Bob's client needs to send a PUSH command to Alice's machine. Alice's machine receives the PUSH, opens a TCP connection to Bob's machine, and sends the file to Bob. Do I have that correct? My questions: 1) How does the PUSH packet get from Bob to Alice? Bob cannot send it directly, because he cannot open a TCP connection to Alice, because she is behind the firewall. Does it get cached somewhere? If so, how would Alice know to look for it? 2) Does this only work if Alice's NAT box supports uPNP and/or port forwarding? If so, what if Alice and, say, Carol are behind the same NAT box -- how does the router know which computer Bob is trying to send the PUSH to? 3) Suppose Alice tries to PUSH a file onto Bob's machine, but Bob had not requested that file. Does the servent on Bob's machine receive it anyway? Or does it reject the incoming file? Thanks, Mike",[],False

5518114,Android Maps Caching Lines Drawn,"I'm developing an application that's tracing lines of highways on the Google Maps SDK Add-On. There are a lot of points painted, which inadvertently make the Maps very sluggish to navigate. It seems iOS Maps take care of this issue, as a significant amount of points can be drawn without the maps becoming sluggish. I started sampling points depending on zoom level. E.g. zoom level 7 only uses, and draws lines to, every 20th point to trace the route. But even that is still too many points and ends up with a very sluggish panning and zooming experience. Two questions: One: Is it possible to detect the current region of the map being displayed in the phone, and no longer paint points off-screen? EDIT - after some initial investigation it's easily possible to detect the clipping region and not paint points/lines. quickReject is the function I've used for this. It does not help too much with performance as all points are still being traversed to identify if they must be drawn - I'm sure it can be optimized. Two: Is it at all possible to cache, perhaps the path, being drawn (this would have to be done per zoom level, I assume, due to the projection of the point?)",[],False

5717863,Passing data between concrete states?,"I have a state machine pattern implementation that's pretty straightforward, but I've got a design problem I don't know an elegant solution to. Here's some partly pseudo code to illustrate. Basically, the event triggering the state change also is providing data that belongs in the new state, and I don't know if there's a nice way to do it besides a shared class in the parent Context object, or by mangling the constructor for this special case. Edit - in more detail I have my states setup to encapsulate state specific data as well as logic, which includes, in this case, a GUI screen belonging to the current state. This seems to be a more elegant way of handling not only separation of logic, but also state specific data. Here's what my abstract state looks like, Here's my Game class, mainly functioning as a data holder, but it also controls the game loop timer, firing main events, etc. You'll see that I opted for composite containment of the CurrentState rather than implementing pass-through methods. That was mostly because I disliked the messiness of passing through the calls when I really didn't need to. Also, the whole state stores a reference to Context, rather than passing it per method. I've got two questions/problems with the pattern. Every concrete state MUST implement in some fashion, EVERY method in the abstract State. This is ridiculous overkill, and currently most of my states only use 20-40% of the methods, leaving me with a couple pages of this: public override void HandleGameStarting() { //not handled in this state } My second issue is that each state has it's own data that only needs to exist while in that state. I don't want to store a huge conglomeration of data in the Context object when a far more encapsulated way of handling it would be putting it in the state. Looking over your example, I suppose one answer to my original question is that I could properly pass through the methods to the Current State, and just do a kind of hack with the data, class Game","['class MainRoomState:State\n\n    public override void HandleJoinSuccess(string gameName, List&lt;LobbyPlayer&gt; players)\n    {\n\n        Context.CurrentState = new LobbyState(Context);\n        //the players list needs to be in the LobbyState\n        //that data is specific to the LobbyState\n    }\n', ""public abstract class GameState\n{\n\n    public GameState(Game context)\n    {\n        Context = context;\n        Net = context.Net;\n    }\n\n    //Incoming events\n    public abstract void HandleConnected();\n    public abstract void HandleDisconnected(string reason);\n    public abstract void HandleNetworkNotification(string msg);\n    public abstract void HandleGameStarting();\n    //there's about 20 more methods not shown here \n"", 'public class Game\n{\n    public Game()\n    {\n       //...bunch of init code here\n       CurrentState = new DisconnectedState(this);\n    }\n    public GameState CurrentState\n    {\n        get;\n        set;\n    }\n\n    //more methods, etc\n}\n', 'public override void HandleJoinSuccess(string gameName, List&lt;LobbyPlayer&gt; players)\n{\n\n    CurrentState = new LobbyState(this);\n    CurrentState.HandleData(gameName,players);\n    //the players list needs to be in the LobbyState\n    //that data is specific to the LobbyState\n}\n']",False

Sometimes after five minutes or so the display will come back. Other times it has been blank for over 20 minutes, so I give up and restart the computer. It seems to happen more often when the computer has been locked for a longer period of time - I lock my computer several times a day, but the problem most happens when I come in at the start of the day. I have updated my video card and monitor drivers. I have two NEC AccuSync 75F monitors both driven by an ATI Radeon HD 2400 Pro. The computer is a Dell Optiplex 740. When the problem occurs both monitors have a green light on to indicate that they are receiving signal. I've tried unplugging the monitors from the video card and turning the monitors on and off. The screen saver is set to one that is not blank screen. The Windows power settings are set to never turn off the display. When the problem occurs there is no significant disk activity occurring.

See the text below from wiki: The C99 standard includes definitions of several new integer types to enhance the portability of programs[2]. The already available basic integer types were deemed insufficient, because their actual sizes are implementation defined and may vary across different systems. The new types are especially useful in embedded environments where hardware supports usually only several types and that support varies from system to system. All new types are defined in inttypes.h header (cinttypes header in C++) and also are available at stdint.h header (cstdint header in C++).

Yes, in onPause()/onResume() I start and stop the worker thread. Skipping to the meat of the worker, I have a loop that ends when it is interrupted and the main variable is set to null (or another worker): Now here's the mystery: the thread disappears! It just stops executing after a while! Seriously! Look at this log output: You'll notice after the last ""posted image change, is running? true"", the thread just goes away and is never heard from again! Looking at the code, there are only a few choices: I could see ""Worker interrupted"" or ""some sort of picture error"" or even ""dropped out of picture loop"". If everything goes OK, it should loop back around and say ""Ready to sleep."" But I don't see anything else from this thread! It is as if it has been suspended at the end of a loop. Surely Android doesn't just pause a thread. This is a mystery. Update: I've taken the whole worker thread out and put it in a separate local service being called by the activity. The worker thread still just disappears after a few loops. That's crazy---a worker thread is a common use for services.

Here is what I am currently doing: I was not able to do something like this without the helper template. For example simply doing did not work, because in those cases where this specialization should be used, the invalid default case was instantiated instead. However I could not find this anywhere in the new C++11 standard, which as far as I know simply is taking from for this kind of stuff.

5901203,How to increase productivity with Vim and Eclipse for PHP5.3 projects (possibly using Eclim integration with Zend Studio),"I always strive to increase my productivity when developing applications and in the span of the last few years, I can say that I have made good steps towards increasing that productivity, but I still find I need more tools or methods. I need to edit faster and learn touch typing (currently in the process) and therefore I find a need to move to Vim. It has been now over one year I have trashed Windows and moved to Linux (Ubuntu to be more precise) and I am using the IDE Zend Studio combined with Aptana Studio for developing OO PHP5.3 websites. Although the IDE does everything I would need from an IDE (which I will enumerate shortly), it lacks the editing mode Vim would give. So my question is: how would I have all the same following 'killer features' I already have within this IDE in Vim? Here is the extensive list of features I need to keep the productivity at an high level for me: Code completion for PHP5.3, not just PHP5 and not just the PHP functions, but any libraries that are added to the buildpath, such as Zend Framework and my own library. Code formatting, I don't use it much, except for XML files, but that is something I would need soon as I will start to lead more people within my company and formatters will help to keep the code coherence. I use Oxygen XML editor within Zend Studio (eclipse) for editing Docbook XML technical documentation. It has already proven of great quality to me and I would like to keep it. Syntax validation for any file extensions that can be used on the Web, mostly for me would be PHP5.3 syntax, html syntax (not that important), CSS, Javascript (that's why I have Aptana Studio integrated with Zend Studio, their javascript editor is great with JQuery support) Maybe a git integration just like EGit (eclipse plugin)? Not required but a nice addon. Debugging features (already using it through the ZendDebugger) Powerful searching within files I know that is a lot, but I am already having all this within my IDE and as I said, I feel the need to move to mode based editors like Vim to be more productive when typing and I feel the learning curve and time invested in setting up all of this will be well worth the effort. I know that there is Eclim, which integrates eclipse to its daemon and I am thinking of using just that, if anyone has feedback on Eclim used with Zend Studio that would be appreciated. Along with Eclim, if I need more vim plugins to achieve my needs, I would gladly appreciate it if someone could direct me to them.",[],False

I have created a few pages with anchor links that go to a certain div in the same page.

So then everything looks off because I am using background images that remain in the same place. So when I first go to this page its fine, until I click the link to go that section versus scrolling down on the page. I put a back to top link there as well. If you click the back to top link the alignment of everything jumps back to the way it should be. So if the user clicks the back to top link they wont see the mistake but if they choose to ignore that and just scroll to the top they will see the shift in the page. So.....when the address bar reads www.mysite.com/page.php its ok. When it says www.mysite.com/page.php#top it's ok. But when it says www.mysite.com/page.php#california the alignment is messed up and all the elements including the myaccount link at the top hugs the very top of the browser window along with the company logo etc. Where should I start looking to fix the problem?

My scores were well below those of most of the freshman (according to collegeboard.org), and in addition, the requirements for the college include a physics and calculus course. I'm currently a junior in high school. I don't feel I'm going down the wrong path in life, but I'm starting to wonder if it's going to be harder than I suspected. I don't have a guidance counselor (I'm in an independent study school, though the counselors at the school I transferred from were part of the reason I transferred) and I don't know anyone personally who has anything to do with college or a technical career.

How should I change my program so that it would still calculate the same answer?","['def myfunc(x, n, step): \n  if n &gt; 0: \n    return x**n + myfunc(x, n - step, step) \n  return 1 #In case n is 0\n']",False

6026998,ReportViewer: Combine Multiple Reports into one report,"I have a report that I need to run multiple times, with different data input each time. Each report has a page header that uniquely identifies it, the actual body of data, and then a footer that contains the page count in a [x of y pages] format. Obviously I could run each report separately, but I need the page numbers to be across all reports. So that if I'm running it two times, and the first time it has 3 pages, and the second time it has two pages, the footer shows [x of 5 pages] at the bottom of each report. I tried creating a master report and just embedding the report, but it doesn't show the page header then, I've also considered running them separately, and passing in a parameter to adjust the page number, but I would obviously need to render each report, find out the page total, then re-render each report to have the correct page total at the footer. Any suggestions? Anything I'm obviously missing?",[],False

6034001,Using Database Information to Change CSS/Appearance of Text,"Disclaimer: I'm new to web development. Goal: I'm creating an event calendar, and there will be status for each event: completed; not completed; and completed late. If an event is completed, I want it to be highlighted green. If an event is not completed, I want it to be highlighted red. If it's completed late, I want it to be highlighted yellow. Note: With this in mind, I already have everything set up that needs to be in place so far up to this point (database, etc.). Question: I'm wanting to know how I can use my current platforms (HTML/CSS/CodeIgniter/PHP/JS), to access the event condition (completed, not completed, completed late) from the database (MySQL) to highlight (or change the background color of) the event shown in the calendar. I'm wondering what resources I could look into making this possible, and complete solutions are also welcome. I will be more than happy to provide any other information omitted from this post. Thank you so much for all of your help!",[],True
