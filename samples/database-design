3463,SSD seems to stop working 5 minutes after booting,"I have a HTPC that I built 6 weeks ago. It had a faulty motherboard that was DOA which I swapped out but since then it has worked fine. That is until recently. Now when I boot up the computer (from a cold boot), everything seems fine. It loads Windows 7 fine (which is up to date) and seems to run every program fine. But it seems that about 5 minutes later, the machine 'freezes'. When it freezes I cannot alt+tab between windows or get to task manager. I can't get to the start menu, yet I can move the mouse around fine and anything running and displaying on the screen still seems to work. The CPU and memory usage don't spike. It will sit there for a few minutes, then reset. While it is resetting I noticed that it no longer detects my OCZ Vertex 2 SSD (which is the only HDD in the machine). It them says operating system missing or something to that effect as it thinks there is no system drive. If I press reset on the machine, it does the same thing again - doesn't detect the SSD, says missing operating system. However if I turn off the machine and cold boot then it boots into Windows fine and starts all over again (freezes after 5 minutes). The problem still occurs if I boot into safe mode. If I boot up with an Ubuntu live CD and don't use the hard disk at all then I don't have a problem, it seems to work without a hiccup. Unfortunately I do not have a spare drive or PSU to test with, but is anyone able to shed any light? I suspect it is either the SSD or the SATA controller on the motherboard. The PSU is kind of suspect, but after removing all other components (extra case fans, optical drive etc) I still have the exact same problem. I wouldn't think that an SSD would draw that much power anyway. All of my drivers/software is up to date (and I have tried restoring to previous states).",[],False

15377,Java code that determines the headers in an mp3 file,"I've been writing a program that can determine any and every data about an mp3 file. Based on the info on this webpage (http://www.multiweb.cz/twoinches/mp3inside.htm), my program reads the whole mp3 file into a byte array, then checks for Tag v2 at the start and Tag v1 at the end of the file. My problem is with the data that you can get from the headers. As far as I understand, I need to search for bytes that are 1111_1111 and the next one is 111x_xxxx. There are a fair few matches for this criteria that aren't headers, just random coincidence, so I've made an MP3Header class, that has all the fields mentioned on the above webpage (ID, layer, bitrate etc..) and overriden the equals method to return true if ID, layer, and frequency match(I use the first header that I find as the base, and compare every other one after it to that one). This method seems to work perfectly for CBR mp3 files, however some VBR ones are giving me a hard time. The first header I find is incorrect, and from that point on, the whole comparison is screwed (I'm not checking bitrate for equality so that can't be the reason). The only valid explanation I can come up with, is that the Tag at the start may contain characters from the extended ASCII table, and since Java doesn't have unsigned int, a 1111_1111 (255) byte might be interpreted as -1 when converted to int. My question is, how can I make sure that the bytes I find are indeed a proper header? Or should I store everything that matches the criteria, and check which one is the most frequent, and go with that? Thanks, István P.S: I know this could probably be solved with only a few lines of code if I used JMF, however I'm enjoying the challenge of writing it like this.",[],False

148151,Security with JSP/JavaBeans/Servlets/MySQL,"Background A html page will ask the user to type their username and password. These are credentials for a MySQL database (i.e. they will be used in JDBC connection so that no password is physically stored in the files). On submit a servlet will be called which tries to connect to the database. If it can, the credentials are correct and a JSP page will load. If not, an error will be displayed. If the login was a success, the web application will then use servlets perforimng SQL queries/updates on the database and returning Java Beans to JSP pages. Questions For memory purposes I'm guessing the JDBC will need to be closed meaning subsequent pages will need to restart the connection using the credentials provided earlier. Obviously the user doesn't want to be providing a password everytime so it's going to have to be stored anyway. If they are stored in a Java object/bean for that session (considering it would have to be plaintext so it could be retrieved and used)...are they susceptible to attack?

The reasons for Linux is that it is lightweight I could allocated more memory to the VM rather than having a host like Windows consume it. Do you think this type of setup would be good to dev on?

209412,How to save and load different types of objects?,"During coding I frequently encounter this situation: I have several objects (, , ...) with the same base type , which has abstract methods and . Each object can (and has to) save some specific kind of data, by overriding the method. I have a list of objects which contains various objects. I walk the list and the method for each object. At this point I think it's a good OO design. (Or am I wrong?) The problems start when I want to reload the data: Each object can load its own data, but I have to know the concrete type in advance, so I can instantiate the right and call the method. So the loading method has to know a great deal about the concrete types. I usually ""solved"" this problem by writing some kind of marker before calling , which is used by the loader to determine the right . I always had/have a bad feeling about this. It feels like some kind of anti-pattern... Are there better ways? EDIT: I'm sorry for the confusion, I re-wrote some of the text. I'm aware of serialization and perhaps there is some next-to-perfect solution in Java/.NET/yourFavoriteLanguage, but I'm searching for a general solution, which might be better and more ""OOP-ish"" compared to my concept.","['ConcreteType1', 'ConcreteType2', 'AbstractType', 'save', 'load', 'save', 'AbstractType', 'ConcreteTypeX', 'save', 'ConcreteTypeX', 'load', 'save', 'ConcreteTypeX']",False

My Computer shows nothing new nor does the disk management tool. The server's dock works with other hard drives and this hard drive is also still usable by my laptop.

315527,Blending values on the number line,"If we consider a portion of the number line, say on the interval $[0,100]$, and split that into regions e.g. split at $80$ to create $2$ regions. Now I want to subdivide the two regions. The region $[0,80]$ has $m$ partitions and the region $[80,100]$ has $n$ partitions. If $m = 2$ and $n = 10$ (for example), and the subpartitioning was done by splitting the region up equally, when we go from the first region to the second, the partition size is very different. What I want to do is blend the divisions between regions. Suggestions on how I can do this (bearing in mind I'm not that good at maths) welcome! EDIT: Sorry for being unclear. Picture should help. In this pic there's 2 regions divided into 2 and 4 (I couldn't easily draw 10 divisions!). The upper part shows equidistant splitting which is ignorant of what's happening in a neighbouring region. The lower part of the picture is roughly what I want. A key requirement is the nodes in the interval $[80,100]$ go from having larger spacing to smaller spacing the further they get away from the interval $[0,80]$. If there was 10 nodes within $[80,100]$, they'd be mainly bunched up towards 100 and the gaps between the nodes would get progressively smaller. The larger spacing is because of the large division size in the neighbouring interval. The number line could be split up into any number of regions, and the number of divisions on each region is not chosen by me, but imposed on me. One region would affect adjacent regions only.",[],False

However, the cuda c programming guide mentions that kernel calls are asynchronous ie. the CPU does not wait for the first kernel call to finish and thus, the CPU can also call the second kernel before the 1st has finished.

With using hotkey + input simulation, the problem is that modifier is usually still held down when key hit is simulated, and thus it gets processed differently (usually — ignored) by most applications. I did find one solution for that (see ompldr.org/vN2U3MA/pgrebind.tar for example files), but there is still two problems: First, either the modifier has to be pressed for each arrow press, or (in scripts above) there is a chance that it will be considered by the system as pressed if the key was immediately released. Second, it is slow. So, is it possible to do this better? Is there something that can be used already (xkb doesn't seem to be able to do such), or how hard it would be to wrute such?",[],False

One interesting one I've found is that Master of Engineering in Professional Practice. It looks more useful and practical than a MBA in project management.

The university I'm looking at does not have a Software Engineering major in the school of engineering. I'm not interested in architecture astronomy, but I am interested in helping my company succeed and being able to communicate technical information at a high and effective level as well as being able to lead my co-programmers toward a more robust end product.

Oh, and how do I get past the fact that a masters degree would make me more qualified to be the project manager than... the project manager? (who is my supervisor)",[],False

It should be simple but I'm having trouble proving it. Let $H$ be a separable Hilbert space, and $B:H \rightarrow H$ a positive trace class (covariance) operator. The sentence I can't prove is the following on page 3: Consider the covariance operator $B$ restricted to the range of $B$, i.e., $$B:\mathcal{R}(B) \rightarrow \mathcal{R}(B),~~~~~~~~~(15)$$ then the (self-adjoint) inverse $B^{-1}$ exists on this subspace since $B&gt;0$, and hence $B^{-1}&gt;0$ on $\mathcal{R}(B)$. This seems somewhat counterintuitive - how do we know that there isn't an element outside $\mathcal{R}(B)$ that gets mapped into $\mathcal{R}(B)$, thereby preventing invertibility? My first thought was to use the existence of a square root operator $B^{\frac{1}{2}}$ and just unwrap the definitions of inverse functions, positivity of operators, etc. However, I was unsuccessful in this endeavor, and I think a more sophisticated approach may be required.",[],False

556964,What considerations are there when buying a polarising filter?,"I have an Olympus EPL1 with two lenses: the micro 4/3rds 14-42mm and the 4/3rds 40-150mm. At the beach today, I could see the sea creatures in the rock pools but couldn't take a picture of them. The reason I could see them was because I was wearing polarised sunglasses. Sticking the sunglasses in front of the lens didn't work. A passing professor of physics told me that it was because my sunglasses are prescription glasses! So I'm considering getting a polarising filter, but have absolutely no idea what to get or what to look for (I've never even used filters before, let alone thought about buying one). Reading around on the internet, I see that there are two types: circular and linear. How do I decide which to get? I've also read that I probably shouldn't bother with a filter for the 14-42mm because the front of the lens rotates when it focusses. (This isn't true of the 40-150mm, I just checked.) As a first foray into the realm of filters, would I be really hampering myself by only getting a filter for the 40-150mm lens? What's a reasonable price to pay for a filter? Given that I'm only dipping a toe in this particular water, I don't want to pay a great deal for something that might turn out to be not as useful as I thought, but I do want to give it a fair go. Looking on a certain website, named for a South American river, I see a circular polariser filter of the right size for my lens (\phi 58) with a RRP of 70UKP but on sale for 14UKP. Don't touch with a bargepole? Or reasonable for the experiment? My most likely use would be shots through water, and scenery shots with the sun low on the horizon (happens a lot in Norway).",[],False
571933,Any way to override .blur() if .submit() is called upon in jQuery?,"I'm writing up custom code for a CMS for a website. When a user clicks on the submit button (created with jQuery UI), it calls the click event on the button, which in turn calls a submit event, which submits the form. Said form also checks specific fields to see if they have text, and will show error messages and deactivate the submit button until the issues are resolved. To do this, I currently use .focus(), which has a .blur() function inside it which checks to see if the error was fixed and removes the notice if so (and if there's no other errors, re-activates the button). Now, the issue I have is that if the user edits one of the fields being checked at any time, if they don't click out of it and try submitting the form data, the .blur() function takes control (as it should by how this is coded), so it takes a second click to submit the form data. Is there a way to have .submit() take precedence over .blur() in jQuery so this issue can't occur (for now I can simply tell the users using this to not do the steps to cause it)?

What I want is a database where I can add properties to products dynamically. The only thing I can come up with is the following: One product table with an ID, a Name and a Description. One properties table with an ID, Product_ID, Property and a Value. This way I would potentially get a gigantic, I-suppose-not-so-efficient, table of properties.

724770,"Question about Ruby on Rails, Constants, belongs_to & Database Optimization/Performance","I've developed a web based point of sale system for one of my clients in Ruby on Rails with MySQL backend. These guys are growing so fast that they are ringing close to 10,000 transactions per day corporate-wide. For this question, I will use the transactions table as an example. Currently, I store the transactions.status as a string (ie: 'pending', 'completed', 'incomplete') within a varchar(255) field that has an index. In the beginning, it was fine when I was trying to lookup records by different statuses as I didn't have to worry about so many records. Over time, using the query analyzer, I have noticed that performance has worsened and that varchar fields can really slowdown your query speed over thousands of lookups. I've been thinking about converting these varchar fields to integer based status fields utilizing STATUS CONSTANT within the Transaction model like so: Is this the best route for me to take? What do you guys suggest? I am already using proper indexes on various lookup fields and memcached for query caching wherever possible.

728094,Matching the width of a table column to text in a fixed width table (HTML/CSS),"I have a table of log entries that I want to display with two columns: the timestamp, and the log entry itself.

At the moment I'm not worried about only running jobs on a single node in a cluster of rails servers. Rufus scheduler looks good but I'd have to write code to persist the jobs and restart them when rails restarts. Delayed_job deals with persistence but I can't see how to run jobs on a regular schedule, except possibly in rescheduling a job at a new time when it runs resque with resque-scheduler seems very close but I'd like to avoid having to add redis to our stack and I'd likely end up trying to reimplement some of the UI in rails so that users can add / remove / manage jobs and it would great if it could use the same ActiveRecord backend as the rest of the application.",[],False

816281,"system function call, any suggestions?","I have a build a website where users need to login to, and the authentication is based on SESSION variables and DB. To simplify, let me describe it like this: I have simple users who belong to groups, and I have group managers. All of them own a subscription. When a group manager decides to upgrade a service, it is done for all his users immediately. I would need to update all subscriptions and I would need to go and charge for each subscription individually. So. What I need to do is go to the DB, and start going one by one: The thing is, that when a group manager is updating the service, I would need to fire a batch process, which might take a while to complete, but if the group manager closes the browser for some reason (presses the stop button, power goes out, zillion other reasons the connection goes out), the action wouldn't complete. And users will be left untreated. I thought the way to go about this would be to start a shell command with a PHP script. I would send the parameters to the script like system(""php batch.php?ID=$group_id?process=all"") which in turn would probably get the job done. My issue is, that I am used to authenticating my users and the data throughout the website, as said, by SESSION parameters etc. But in this case (calling a system command), I cannot really go and check who actually fired that script. It could be a user, it could be the script I intended. I would like to prevent users accessing that script, and I want that script to be completed after it has been issued. How can I accomplish that ? Any other suggestions ? Thanks!",['1. charge\n2. receive status from cc company.\n3. update the DB entry accordingly.\n4. repeat for next simple user\n'],False

I thought of using like this: But this does not work! As I said the connection is provided by a residence(which is actually just forwarding the university connection).

887053,"What's causing this background-image to display ""incorrectly"" in Opera and Firefox?","I know this is something I'm probably doing wrong, so please don't incinerate me for the thread title. I'm trying to put together a small personal website using HTML 5/CSS3. I've checked with the w3c validator and the site and CSS file fully conform according to the validator (However the validator has a warning attached that it might not be perfect). I'm not sure how to explain it without a picture, so here's a comparison of Chrome/Opera/Firefox: So, you can sorta see how in Chrome the background image is in one non-repeating piece, whereas in Opera/Firefox the image has, oddly, been broken up and placed slightly differently. I'm confident this is due to an error on my part, but I've had no luck at all figuring out why the image is being mangled in Opera and Firefox. Here's the CSS that's relevant to this issue: And the HTML: Can anyone see what I'm doing wrong?

The thing is that since my site is new, and it goes up and down, I'm pretty sure that almost no request is made to it except for those from my own testing. My tests usually last about 10 - 20 mins, and I shut down the servers behind HAProxy when finished and leave HAProxy running. In other words, the extra 1% of memory is probably caused by handling my requests during the tests, but shouldn't HAProxy release them when the servers is shut down and no one is making requests anymore?

961592,Caching Function Results in SQL Server 2000,"I want to memoize function results for performance, i.e. lazily populate a cache indexed on the function arguments. The first time I call a function, the cache won't have anything for the input arguments, so it will calculate it and store it before returning it. Subsequent calls just use the cache. However, it seems that SQL Server 2000 has a stupid arbitrary rule about functions being ""deterministic"". INSERTs, UPDATEs, and regular stored procedure calls are forbidden. However, extended stored procedures are allowed. How is this deterministic? If another session modifies the database state, the function output will change anyways. I'm steaming mad. I had thought I could make caching transparent to the user. Is this possible? I don't have the permissions to deploy extended stored procedures. EDIT: This limitation is still in 2008. You can't call RAND, for God's sake! The cache would be implemented by me in the DB. A cache is any data store used for caching... EDIT: There are no cases where the same arguments to a function will yield different results, outside of changes to the underlying data. This is a BI platform, and the only changes come from scheduled ETL, at which time I would TRUNCATE the cache table. These are I/O intensive time series calculations, on the order of O(n^4). I don't have the mandate to change the underlying table or indexes. Also, a lot of these functions use the same intermediate functions, and caching allows those to be used. UDFs are not truly deterministic, unless they account for changes in database state. What's the point? Is SQL Server caching? (Ironic.) If SQL Server is caching, then it must be expiring on changes to tables that are schema bound. If they're schema bound, then why not bind tables that the function modifies? I can see why procs aren't allowed, although that's just sloppy; just schema bind procs. And, BTW, why allow extended stored procs? You can't possibly track what those do to ensure determinism!!! Argh!!! EDIT: My question is: Is there any way to lazily cache function results in a way that can be used in a view?",[],False

The last 2 we've used a D-link dir-655 router with their modem and my wireless router served access to a 23 room house without issue for those 2 years. I live in Western Mass. We had tornadoes here beginning of November. Power/cable were down for 7 days. After all was back to running, we had wireless access that wasn't as quick but it was working for a couple of weeks. Suddenly it stopped working. I couldn't get a wireless signal any more. The laptop next to the modem couldn't connect because the network card hadn't worked in a long time. The desktop downstairs is 6 months old and was connected wirelessly. I even ran a network cable all the way downstairs to my desktop and that didn't work in any of the 4 ports out of the router, either. I even have a network cable tester that showed the cable was good. We decided to ask the cable company to replace the modem with a modem/router so we wouldn't have to buy a new one. The tech came, installed a Netgear and everything was fine for about 4 hours. Then the wireless connectivity issues started again. Every computer, wireless printer, magicJack, web-tv, Apple TV and cell phone (12 devices) had intermittent connectivity issues. Rebooting the Netgear would give us about 2 hours of uninterrupted bliss and them it would start again. The speedtest.net was running download speeds between 2 and 10. Charter sent another tech who said the Netgear device was not a good model and replaced it with a Netgear Docsis 3.0. This brought my signal through his diagnostic programs back up to where they should be, he told me. Even while he was there, I showed him that the speedtest.net was still bringing me inconsistent and slow speeds. He finally put in a powered signal booster splitter on my inside line. We reboot everything and all was good for about 5 hours again. After that, we had the same issues. This time, however, even rebooting everything would only last a few minutes of uninterrupted signal. ALSO, hardwiring the computer downstairs would only give me moments of connectivity and then I'd have to seesaw back and forth through the device manager with the wireless by switching off and on the ethernet and the wireless cards and this would only work ONCE in a while. By the way, each time a technician was here, they said they checked the outside lines and said they showed only strong signals coming into the house and that the last modem/router was showing history of good signals. Can ANYONE think of something that might be the cause of this issue? I mentioned the tornado because it's after that when the signal didn't work exactly the same and then stopped working entirely after a while.

1084082,Windows Service Increasing CPU Consumption,"At my job, I have a clutch of six Windows services that I am responsible for, written in C# 2003. Each of these services contain a timer that fires every minute or so, where the majority of their work happens. My problem is that, as these services run, they start to consume more and more CPU time through each iteration of the loop, even if there is no meaningful work for them to do (ie, they're just idling, looking through the database for something to do). When they start up, each service uses an average of (about) 2-3% of 4 CPUs, which is fine. After 24 hours, each service will be consuming an entire processor for the duration of its loop's run. Can anyone help? I'm at a loss as to what could be causing this. Our current solution is to restart the services once a day (they shut themselves down, then a script sees that they're offline and restarts them at about 3AM). But this is not a long term solution; my concern is that as the services get busier, restarting them once a day may not be sufficient... but as there's a significant startup penalty (they all use NHibernate for data access), as they get busier, exactly what we don't want to be doing is restarting them more frequently. @akmad: True, it is very difficult. Yes, a service run in isolation will show the same symptom over time. No, it doesn't. We've looked at that. This can happen at 10AM or 6PM or in the middle of the night. There's no consistency. We do; and they are. The services are doing exactly what they should be, and nothing else. Unfortunately, that requires foreknowledge of exactly when the services are going to be maxing out CPUs, which happens on an unpredictable schedule, and never very quickly... which makes things doubly difficult, because my boss will run and restart them when they start having problems without thinking of debug issues. No, they're using a fairly consistent amount of RAM (approx. 60-80MB each, out of 4GB on the machine). Good suggestions, but rest assured, we have tried all of the usual troubleshooting. What I'm hoping is that this is a .NET issue that someone might know about, that we can work on solving. My boss' solution (which I emphatically don't want to implement) is to put a field in the database which holds multiple times for the services to restart during the day, so that he can make the problem go away and not think about it. I'm desperately seeking the cause of the real problem so that I can fix it, because that solution will become a disaster in about six months. @Yaakov Ellis: They each have a different function. One reads records out of an Oracle database somewhere offsite; another one processes those records and transfers files belonging to those records over to our system; a third checks those files to make sure they're what we expect them to be; another is a maintenance service that constantly checks things like disk space (that we have enough) and polls other servers to make sure they're alive; one is running only to make sure all of these other ones are running and doing their jobs, monitors and reports errors, and restarts anything that's failed to keep the whole system going 24 hours a day. So, if you're asking what I think you're asking, no, there isn't one common thing that all these services do (other than database access via NHibernate) that I can point to as a potential problem. Unfortunately, if that turns out to be the actual issue (which wouldn't surprise me greatly), the whole thing might be screwed -- and I'll end up rewriting all of them in simple SQL. I'm hoping it's a garbage collector problem or something easier to deal with than NHibernate. @Joshdan: No secret. As I said, we've tried all the usual troubleshooting. Profiling was unhelpful: the profiler we use was unable to point to any code that was actually executing when the CPU usage was high. These services were torn apart about a month ago looking for this problem. Every section of code was analyzed to attempt to figure out if our code was the issue; I'm not here asking because I haven't done my homework. Were this a simple case of the services doing more work than anticipated, that's something that would have been caught. The problem here is that, most of the time, the services are not doing anything at all, yet still manage to consume 25% or more of four CPU cores: they're finding no work to do, and exiting their loop and waiting for the next iteration. This should, quite literally, take almost no CPU time at all. Here's a example of behaviour we're seeing, on a service with no work to do for two days (in an unchanging environment). This was captured last week: Day 1, 8AM: Avg. CPU usage approx 3% Day 1, 6PM: Avg. CPU usage approx 8% Day 2, 7AM: Avg. CPU usage approx 20% Day 2, 11AM: Avg. CPU usage approx 30% Having looked at all of the possible mundane reasons for this, I've asked this question here because I figured (rightly, as it turns out) that I'd get more innovative answers (like Ubiguchi's), or pointers to things I hadn't thought of (like Ian's suggestion). So does the CPU spike happen immediately preceding the timer callback, within the timer callback, or immediately following the timer callback? You misunderstand. This is not a spike. If it were, there would be no problem; I can deal with spikes. But it's not... the CPU usage is going up generally. Even when the service is doing nothing, waiting for the next timer hit. When the service starts up, things are nice and calm, and the graph looks like what you'd expect... generally, 0% usage, with spikes to 10% as NHibernate hits the database or the service does some trivial amount of work. But this increases to an across-the-board 25% (more if I let it go too far) usage at all times while the process is running. That made Ian's suggestion the logical silver bullet (NHibernate does a lot of stuff when you're not looking). Alas, I've implemented his solution, but it hasn't had an effect (I have no proof of this, but I actually think it's made things worse... average usage is seeming to go up much faster now). Note that stripping out the NHibernate ""sections"" (as you recommend) is not feasible, since that would strip out about 90% of the code in the service, which would let me rule out the timer as a problem (which I absolutely intend to try), but can't help me rule out NHibernate as the issue, because if NHibernate is causing this, then the dodgy fix that's implemented (see below) is just going to have to become The Way The System Works; we are so dependent on NHibernate for this project that the PM simply won't accept that it's causing an unresolvable structural problem. I just noted a sense of desperation in the question -- that your problems would continue barring a small miracle Don't mean for it to come off that way. At the moment, the services are being restarted daily (with an option to input any number of hours of the day for them to shutdown and restart), which patches the problem but cannot be a long-term solution once they go onto the production machine and start to become busy. The problems will not continue, whether I fix them or the PM maintains this constraint on them. Obviously, I would prefer to implement a real fix, but since the initial testing revealed no reason for this, and the services have already been extensively reviewed, the PM would rather just have them restart multiple times than spend any more time trying to fix them. That's entirely out of my control and makes the miracle you were talking about more important than it would otherwise be. That is extremely intriguing (insofar as you trust your profiler). I don't. But then, these are Windows services written in .NET 1.1 running on a Windows 2000 machine, deployed by a dodgy Nant script, using an old version of NHibernate for database access. There's little on that machine I would actually say I trust.",[],False

My language of choice is C#, but I chose to use Ruby for this exercise to get some familiarity with it. The log file is somewhat predictable. Most lines (99.8%, to be specific) match the following pattern: However, in a few places in the log there much are complicated queried that, for some reason, span several lines: Two things to point out about these entries is that they appear to cause some sort of corruption in the log file, because they end with unprintable characters, and then suddenly the next entry begins on the same line. Since this obviously rules out capturing data on a per-line basis, I think the next best option is to match everything between the word ""TIME:"" and either the next instance of ""TIME:"" or the end of the file. I'm not sure how to express this using regular expressions. Is there a more efficient approach? The log file I need to parse will be over 1.5GB.

Determine the formula for $R_3$ using the linear system for the loop currents. Here is the given image: I know that the point of balance (when $r = 0$) is $R_3/R_1 = R_4/R_2$. Thus, $R_3 = R_4R_1/R_2$. Using Kirchoff's Current Law, I started getting a linear system. $$I_1 R_1 - I_rr - I_3R_3 = 0$$ $$I_2 R_2 - I_4R_4+I_rr = 0$$ Which would also represent the point of balance.

So if I'm creating a new Person, I need to make sure it has all the component objects populated off the bat, and if I'm retrieving a Person from the database, I need to make sure that any objects that aren't populated from the database get populated with empty objects. First question, of course -- am I correct in my assumptions above? It does seem that if I try to bind to person.contactInfo.homeAddress.street and there is no ContactInfo, I get a null pointer exception. Second, what's the best way to initialize my object. I can think of a couple of approaches. One is to initialize all member objects at declaration: and so forth. Another approach is to have a PersonFactory that initializes everything (or to have a factory method Person.getInstance that initializes everything). In the case of retrieving a Person from the database, the first approach will solve the issue (i.e. if this particular person doesn't have an address in the database, the object will still have an Address), but this will mean creating each object twice. Not sure how to handle this otherwise, except to make the DAO explicitly populate everything even if nothing has been retrieved from the database.

Good relational db theory would create the two entities (Q and V) as separate relations, requiring a join then a sum or count aggregate call. Another possibility is to break normal form and occasionally materialize the aggregate value of votes as an attribute in Question (e.g. Question.votes). Performance is gained on reads, however, depending on how stale you are willing to let your ""votes"" data get, it requires a lot more rights to that Question record... in turn hindering performance. Other techniques involving caching, etc. can be used. But I'm just wondering, performance wise what's the best solution?

I have about 2 years coding experience and I need to get this fixed once and for all because my boss is really pissed now. I have multithreaded parsers which parse data feeds and create xml output files of that data feed in a new schema. With each post I get in the feed I select a unique id for that post, delete it after getting it and then check if it already exists. The impact this has had on the DB is severe. It seems like the timeouts which occur quite often but I work around it by retrying the insert or update whatever it is. Recently I found that the parsers get stuck on the db connection statements when trying to make a new connection. Is it better to create one open connection for each parser and let it do its work or as I have it now which is as follows: get data feed post parse fields and create a connection to db and post table and open connection go get a unique id from a table within the same db delete the id from the table (this causes some timeouts) make a new connection to another DB on the same server and verify if id exists close that connection create new schema insert record into table in same DB close first connection if anyone is willing and has the time to view my code and give a critical review, then please let me know and I can email it to you.

1450622,MSI uninstall not executing Installer class tagged with [RunInstaller],"We are developing a MSI installer solution (based on VDPROJ, unfortunately) that will install an instance of our server application. The installer has all been designed to support the concept of installing multiple instances. This means we've written a small utility that takes a 'stub' MSI and then outputs a configured MSI with a unique Product Code, Product Name etc amongst other things. The Product Code is updated in both the Property table and Summary Information stream. Everything seems to work fine on the install step. Our two test instances, AcmeCorp and ZurgCorp, are installed side-by-side just fine. Their Windows Services are all registered and function as expected. However, we have encountered a very strange issue when it comes to uninstalling one of these instances. It doesn't matter which instance we uninstall first. But which ever one we choose, the uninstall will proceed very quickly - but so quickly that it actually misses out calling our .NET Installer subclass (tagged with RunInstaller and being called by the CustomAction). The uninstall will be 'successful' and the MSI will be gone from Add/Remove Programs list. But the Windows Service remains behind because the MSI uninstaller never run our assembly to remove it! Now if we go ahead and uninstall the second instance as well, this one will uninstall just fine including the Windows Service. So what on earth is going on here? It smells to me of some form of reference counting. But where? We've followed the book on this when it comes to making sure the Product Code's are different.

1474330,No solution in CPLEX with very small change in inputs,"I'm using CPLEX in C++ to solve a hub location problem, a MIP, and I've recently found a very precise set of inputs that CPLEX thinks is infeasible (i.e. CPXMIP_INFEASIBLE) even though the problem is certainly feasible. The problem appears to diverge in CPLEX during MIP Presolve; normally at that point the problem is reduced to a null problem, but not in the infeasible input set. I've found that making almost any slight adjustment in the input data can toggle CPLEX's ability to find a solution. For instance, changing 250.242566 to 250.242567, or even just rounding each input value to the nearest integer, will give me a perfectly valid solution. Softening the two slack constraints I have will also allow a solution, but these constraints should not be broken given the input data. The value of these constraint variables after a solution is approximately 0 but slightly negative, e.g. -0.7e-10. (This is suspect since the values should be above 0.) What is going on? I'm clueless. I've tried adjusting some of the CPLEX variables relating to precision (i.e. CPX_PARAM_NUMERICALEMPHASIS, CPX_PARAM_EPOPT, CPX_PARAM_EPMRK, CPX_PARAM_EPRHS) but nothing has helped. The input data itself does not require too much precision--the smallest value in the inputs is 1.412 and the largest is 1520.984907. I'd appreciate any advice or suggestions! UPDATE: I've noticed that the infeasible problem is diverging from the feasible problem during MIP's Presolve. Checking CPXgetprestat for both problems, one notable difference I can see between the two problems is in the pcstat vector one variable cannot be aggregated out in the infeasible set (i.e. the value is 0 in the infeasible problem vs. -4 in the feasible problem). Also, CPXgetprestat's ocstat and orstat vectors have one non-zero value each in the infeasible problem (the feasible problem has none because it has been reduced to a null problem), but I am unsure what to do with these two values. If orstat[0] == 7 and ocstat[0] == 1, does that mean that something is notable in the 7th row and the 1st variable of the problem before Presolve? How would I check this? I have compared the output of CPXwriteprob in both problems and nothing is different other than the input value that I changed by 0.0001 to make the problem infeasible.",[],False

1534153,"Not sure which event to use, to determine when a user control is closing or being navigated away from","We're writing a new app, basing our architecture upon an application the Billy Hollis shared at the December 2012 VS Live conference in Orlando. Billy's app is called BasicNavShell (perhaps there's some who will read this post, who were there and knows what I'm talking about). In our app and implementation of his architecture, we have user controls which are hosted in Billy's SimpleWrapper class. (His SimpleWrapper class inherits the HeaderedContentControl class and implements a custom interface he called IShellNavigation.) Each one of these user controls, hosted in SimpleWrapper, are related to some tables in a database. We call each of these user controls ""sections"" because of the data that is presented to the user and saved. What we want to happen is, when the user navigates from one section to another section, then the data for the section that's being navigated away from, is automatically saved on the user's behalf. I thought that using the Loaded event would work for fetching the data for that section when it first came up. Going back to the BasicNavShell architecture, what Billy did is once a new user control is instantiated, he puts it into a dictionary. Thus, if the user selects the first user control, it is instantiated, placed in the dictionary and displayed to the user. If the user then selects the second user control, it is instantiated, placed into the dictionary and displayed (again, using SimpleWrapper to display the user controls). And if the user then decides they want to return to the first user control, it is retrieved from the dictionary and displayed; it isn't instantiated again. OK, I had thought that the Loaded event for our user controls would be sufficient to retrieve the data that we want to retrieve. That's what we did. Then in order to handle saving the data when the user moved to a different section, we put the saving functionality into the LostFocus event for the user control. Also, in the event that the user closes the application without saving it, we also put the saving functionality into the Unloaded event for the user control. However, in testing this with the VS 2012 debugger, I was surprised to see what actually happens. Here's what I discovered. The user clicks on the first section, the Loaded event fires. The user makes some changes and then clicks on the second section. What happens next is the first section's Unloaded event fires (which surprises me!), then the first section's Loaded event fires (which totally surprises me!!), and then the second section's Loaded event fires. So here's what I'd like to understand: 1) Why did the first section's Unloaded event fire? As far as I understand how WPF's user control events goes, the user control isn't being unloaded, so why did that event fire? 2) Why did the first section's Loaded event fire? It's not being instantiated again; it should (and is) in the dictionary. What's going on here??? Are we going about this wrong? Should we be using some other events other than Loaded (to fetch the data for the first time) and Unloaded (both to save the data when the user goes to a different section and when the application is closed by the user)?",[],False

But when I expand the record, other records appear on their own headers, not the headers of master view. My question is how to make detail rows showing in the same header of master row because they have the same member. It's no need to create another view for them! Is there any option or something else to do that? P/S: My trial period is expired, so I cannot ask DevExpress team for support!

If you are using pretty permalinks in your blog already, then subdirectory sites will work as well. Sub-domain sites It works using wildcard subdomains. You must have this enabled in Apache, and you must also add a wildcard subdomain to your DNS records. (See Step 2 how to set up.) Some hosts have already set up the wildcard on the server side, which means all you need to add is the DNS record.

1731170,JQuery - on the fly CSS animation change only happens when I Ieave browser window and return,"I've been working on this all day as part of a much larger self-project and have come across a slight problem: http://jsfiddle.net/GYv22/2/ I am trying to change the speed of the ball on the fly using the faster/slower buttons. This used to remove the current CSS animation style (with the old speed), however I found it works as expected without doing this, and now just appends a new style (with the new speed), the animation is using keyframes utilising the translate3d property. Not sure if this is the best way to do it, but I thought it was better suited than using classes as I am dynamically changing the animation speed constantly. This works as expected in Firefox (albeit slightly jittery, but speed changes are in real-time i.e. when you click the buttons the ball gets faster/slower!), in Chrome I have to leave the tab and return to see the speed change (???), and in IE 10 the ball animation works, but there is no speed change at all, even when leaving/returning to the tab or in real time. I think the issue is that the animation style is being appended to #horizontal, and I also want it to affect its child element, #ball. This is necessary for future styling changes I am adding, as I want to have other elements moving alongside the ball at the same speed, all moving within 'horizontal'. However, it seems that the child element is not being updated property e.g. until I leave the tab and return. In chrome if I use 'Inspect Element' to inspect the ball directly, the div outline which appears when hovering over the code for #ball is moving independently of the ball on screen! EDIT: I think it's an issue with translate3d and Chrome not using the GPU by default, set in about:flags. I will test and post an update. EDIT: Update: http://jsfiddle.net/GYv22/3/ It would appear to work using -webkit on Chrome with translate rather than translate3d. This is a shame, and feels like a rather hacky method as the tutorial I was following recommended translate3d for GPU power. I tried enabling GPU settings on Chrome at about:flags, but this did not solve my issue either. At least this seems to be a temporary workaround. I also found a solution about adding/removing the animation from child elements directly here, just in case this is of use to anyone else: webkit translate3d issues (peek-thru) but I'm not sure how to implement that for my repeating animation.","[""function animate(x, y) {\n        $('#xSpeed').html(x);\n        $('#ySpeed').html(y);\n\n        var horizontalCSS = 'updown ' + y + 's infinite linear';\n        var ballCSS = 'leftright ' + x + 's infinite linear';\n\n        $('#horizontal')\n            .css('-webkit-animation', horizontalCSS) /* Chrome */\n            .css('-moz-animation', horizontalCSS) /* Firefox */\n            .css('animation', horizontalCSS); /* IE */\n\n        $('#ball')\n            .css('-webkit-animation', ballCSS)\n            .css('-moz-animation', ballCSS)\n            .css('animation', ballCSS);\n    }\n"", ' @-webkit-keyframes leftright {\n    0%, 100% {\n        -webkit-transform: translate(0px, 0);\n\n    }\n    50% {\n        -webkit-transform: translate(545px, 0);\n    }\n}\n@-webkit-keyframes updown {\n    0%, 50%, 100% {\n        -webkit-transform: translate(0, 0);\n    }\n    25% {\n        -webkit-transform: translate(0, 150px);\n    }\n    75% {\n        -webkit-transform: translate(0, -135px);\n    }\n}\n']",False

1921746,Stack overflow from native DLL called from managed application,"I'm getting the infamous (stack overflow) exception from my application when I call into a native DLL. This is being done from a managed C# application on Windows CE 5 (SH4 processor). Compiling the same DLL for Windows XP using the same managed application and everything works fine (no overflow). The routine in the DLL is doing some very complex recursion which is ultimately what is causing the overflow, but again, it works fine on a PC. It seems like I may just need to adjust the stack size when building the DLL? I believe the default stack size for both CE and XP are both 1MB when using the Visual C compiler (I'm using Visual Studio 2005, if that matters). If they both default to the same size, I'm not sure why one would overflow and the other would not, however. I tried adjusting the stack size with the /F compiler flag and the /STACK linker flag but that didn't seem to do anything. It is also not entirely clear to me that I can specify the stack size in a DLL, but rather the executable must set it.

I have some extra memory I could use on increasing the table_cache size, but my sense is that the 900 tables already available aren't doing anything, and increasing it will just waste more energy.

2083293,Firing UI control events from a Unit Test,"As a beginner to TDD I am trying to write a test that assumes a property has had its value changed on a PropertyGrid (C#, WinForms, .NET 3.5). Changing a property on an object in a property grid does not fire the event (fair enough, as it's a UI raised event, so I can see why changing the owned object may be invisible to it). I also had the same issue with getting an AfterSelect on a TreeView to fire when changing the SelectedNode property. I could have a function that my unit test can call that simulates the code a UI event would fire, but that would be cluttering up my code, and unless I make it public, I would have to write all my tests in the same project, or even class, of the objects I am testing (again, I see this as clutter).

2089039,WCF Web API UriTemplate Elements Found in Multiple Methods,"Let's say I am using the new WCF Web API to build a RESTful service and, in my service, I have a section of the URI that will describe the target resource, but is used on (nearly) all methods of the contract. For example, if I have a User service that deals with eCommerce and may look like: If I have to continually load the organization and test for null, this will bog down my code and is not very DRY. (So tempted to spell out DRY...) What I would like to do is load up a property in the MyUserService class that is populated when {OrganizationName} is included in the URI and throw a WebFaultException otherwise. Because this is apart of the URI, what would be the best way to accomplish this? EDIT: For those that may be interested, here is an example of the HttpOperationHandler I came up with. There doesn't seem to be a whole lot of information out there covering this. I also found more information about Processors that will be coming with the WCF Web Api suite and it looks like they will handle this sort of thing better replace HttpOperationHandlers and it seems they may be easier to use.

I am creating the database for this and have the following design in mind: Members Table: Contains the information about the users using their FB ID as the primary key. Preferences Table: Contains the information about the preferences that the user wants. There are going to be approximately 20 fields which the user can specify a preference in but all of them will be optional. I am unsure about the best way to structure my ""preferences"" table and I currently have two ideas: Solution 1: Use a foreign key of the facebook ID and have a new column for each field which can be matched on. A problem which I can see is that there will be a lot of ""null"" values in the database for fields which a value has not been specified. Do ""null"" values in a database occupy space or cause any other problems? Solution 2: Use a foreign key of facebook ID again, but in the next two columns use a key-value pair approach - so one column would contain an ID for a user preference and the other would contain a value for it. For each user preference I would have a record with structure: ""user ID"" - ""preference ID"" - ""value"". problem with this is that the type of value in the ""value"" column will depend on the contents of the ""preference ID"" column My question: Which approach is better?

What I have tried so far is: 1)I have a tabbarcontoller which has its first tab set to to a generic view controller. 2) On load the view controller calls the view with the 5 buttons so application is starting correctly 3) Clicking on (News, events, offers) opens another view controller which has a UIWebView and displays the proper url. There are buttons on top which allows them to switch between 5 functionality. When the user clicks on maps or feed, two different views are loaded as subviews accordingly. However, if i try doing that from the parent page, the views dont appear To add to my problem if i click on the main tabbar (Home, photos or setting) the tabs are switching views but when I revert to the home tab, it should display the parent view with the 5 buttons. The first view is being displayed but it is slightly moved up. In the bottom between the view and the tab bar there is small space where the last viewed UIWebview can be seen. So its not removing the previous views. Also navigating using one of the five buttons again opens the view again but the main tab bar is now hidden :( Can anyone offer some help. cheers,","['-Clicking on News, events,offers launches a UIWebview and changes the loadString via the application delegate.

If a hypersphere happens to actually contain the coordinate then the distance becomes negative. Ergo: given some hyperspheres of the same distance to my coordinate the biggest hypersphere wins. The total count of hyperspheres is guaranteed to stay the same over time. My first thought was to use a KDTree but it won't take the hyperspheres' non-uniform volumes into account. So I looked further and found BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchies) and BIH (Bounding Interval Hierarchies), which seem to do the trick. At least in 2-/3-dimensional space. However while finding quite a bit of info and visualizations on BVHs I could barely find anything on BIHs. My basic requirement is a k-dimensional spatial data structure that takes volume into account and is either super fast to build (off-line) or dynamic with barely any unbalancing. Given my requirements above, which data structure would you go with? Any other ones I didn't even mention? Forgot to mention: hypershperes are allowed (actually highly expected) to overlap!",[],False

Now onto my problem: when I run these, I get an ""OpenGL error 0x0502 in -[EAGLView swapBuffers]"", the 3D view being properly displayed but with a completely pink screen otherwise.

Lets say a solution is presented for this and is applied on my localhost but cant be reproduced to that github repo, is it possible to clone that repo, rollback to the first commit perform the trick and push it (or does that mean that git will still have a history of all those commits? - aka. 6MB).

2285068,Working without stored procedures or triggers,"We have been working on a complex database and client interface for the last 18 months. We are regularly adding new functionnalities to this application, and it is now used by tens of users on a daily basis in all our offices, including sites and overseas. This is just to tell you it is a REAL application with a REAL database. Until now, we still did not have to write any stored procedures, except on a temporary basis to solve minor issues between client versions and updated database model (where the old client version will not properly update the newly created field, until everybody installs the newest version). In the same way, we still did not need any triggers. In fact, the only SPs and triggers are the system ones, or the ones added for replication purpose. I have the strange feeling that SPs and Triggers are mainly used to compensate for database design defaults and/or attempts to bypass database design rules, when developers consider that database optimisation has to oppose database normalisation. The problem is that these tools are time-consuming (for both development or maintenance). Each developer shall then be very carefull using them, keeping in mind that they are the most ""expensive"" items to maintain in a database. Could we consider that having none or few stored procedures / triggers in a database is a good indication of its normalisation level and/or its code maintenance cost? EDIT: Some of you have supplied fair arguments for the use of both triggers and SPs. But I keep on thinking that most of the time these tools are used in an improper or excessive way. How many triggers are set to make some fancy updates between table fields, or to recalculate totals or other aggregated data? How many SPs are used to build temporary tables for reporting issues? These are 2 among many situations where developers use these tools, and I think this usually illustrate database design/normalisation flaws. Some others admit that use of SPs and triggers should be strictly controled. I find it necessary too. I must confess that I am trying to find some upholding arguments, where all these SQL geeks working on our other databases look down at us, telling their friends ""You know what? they do not even use SPs and Triggers!

2443493,Small select subquery slows down the whole query about 10 times,"I have the following MySQL table: is_cover is a field I created to choose only one picture for each : it is set to 1 when the picture has been choosen as a cover and to otherwise. I need to the table to another one, let's call it ; there may be multiple rows in the table for each entry (there is a referential integrity bound on ), but in this case I must extract only one row from the table, hence the need for the coulmn and all the indexing (every other solution I tried produced queries lasting anywhere from 10 to 50 seconds). Even in this case, though, queries are very slow and each takes anywhere from 5 to 8 seconds of execution on a data pool of about 10000 elements in the table and 30000 in the table. Selecting from the table where = 1 is pretty fast and straightforward, but when put in a larger query everything breaks up. (the strings you see with _ prepended are actual numerical values) EXPLAINing the query produces the following result: It looks like the index is being ignored by MySQL (, id 4) but the same happens when I run the small select against the table and everything happens very quickly. I can't find the bottleneck in this query, removing the JOIN to makes everything way faster but the JOINed subquery itself is quite fast and so is the rest of the big query - even with the math-computing code at the beginning it never goes much past 2 seconds of execution. Does anybody know where the bottleneck is, and how to get around that?","[""CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `pics` (\n  `id` mediumint(8) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment,\n  `bnb_id` mediumint(7) unsigned NOT NULL,\n  `img_path` varchar(128) NOT NULL,\n  `img_path_gallery` varchar(128) NOT NULL,\n  `img_path_thumb_small` varchar(128) NOT NULL,\n  `img_path_thumb_large` varchar(128) NOT NULL,\n  `img_path_thumb_grid` varchar(128) NOT NULL,\n  `title` varchar(80) NOT NULL,\n  `order` tinyint(2) NOT NULL,\n  `upload_date` datetime NOT NULL,\n  `state` enum('LOCAL','S3') NOT NULL default 'LOCAL',\n  `is_cover` tinyint(1) unsigned default NULL,\n  PRIMARY KEY  (`id`),\n  UNIQUE KEY `bnb_id_2` (`bnb_id`,`is_cover`),\n  KEY `bnb_id` (`bnb_id`),\n  KEY `is_cover` (`is_cover`)\n) ENGINE=InnoDB  DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 AUTO_INCREMENT=30371 ;\n"", 'bnb_id', 'NULL', 'LEFT JOIN', 'bnb', 'pics', 'bnb', 'bnb_id', 'pics', 'is_cover', 'bnb', 'pics', 'is_cover', 'SELECT subbnb.*, \n            3956 * 2 * ASIN(\n                SQRT(\n                    POWER(\n                        SIN((_LAT - abs(lat)) * pi()/180 / 2), \n                    2) +\n                    COS(_LAT * pi()/180 ) * \n                    COS(abs(lat) * pi()/180) * \n                    POWER(\n                        SIN((_LNG - abs(lng)) * pi()/180 / 2), \n                    2) \n                )\n            ) AS distance,\n            prices.price,\n            pics.img_path_thumb_grid,\n            reviews.count reviewsCount,\n            likes.count likesCount\n        FROM \n            (SELECT\n                bnb.*,\n                bnbdata_a.*,\n                pos.lat,\n                pos.lng\n\n                FROM bnb\n\n                JOIN bnbdata \n                    ON (bnb.id = bnbdata.bnb_id)\n\n                JOIN positions pos\n                    ON (bnb.id = pos.bnb_id) \n            ) subbnb\n\n            LEFT JOIN (\n                    SELECT *\n                    FROM pics \n                    WHERE is_cover = 1\n                ) pics\n                ON (subbnb.id = pics.bnb_id)\n\n\n            LEFT JOIN (SELECT price, bnb_id FROM prices WHERE category = ""DAILY"") prices\n                ON (subbnb.id = prices.bnb_id)\n\n            LEFT JOIN (SELECT COUNT(*) AS count, bnb_id FROM reviews GROUP BY bnb_id) reviews\n                ON (subbnb.id = reviews.bnb_id)\n\n            LEFT JOIN (SELECT COUNT(*) AS count, bnb_id FROM likes GROUP BY bnb_id) likes\n                ON (subbnb.id = likes.bnb_id)\n        WHERE\n            lng BETWEEN _LNGA AND  _LNGB\n            AND lat BETWEEN _LATA AND  _LATB\n        HAVING distance &lt; 10\n        ORDER BY distance\n        LIMIT 0, 25\n', 'id  select_type table   type    possible_keys   key key_len ref rows    Extra\n1   PRIMARY &lt;derived5&gt;  system  NULL    NULL    NULL    NULL    0   const row not found\n1   PRIMARY &lt;derived6&gt;  system  NULL    NULL    NULL    NULL    0   const row not found\n1   PRIMARY &lt;derived2&gt;  ALL NULL    NULL    NULL    NULL    10522   Using where; Using temporary; Using filesort\n1   PRIMARY &lt;derived3&gt;  ALL NULL    NULL    NULL    NULL    7040    \n1   PRIMARY &lt;derived4&gt;  ALL NULL    NULL    NULL    NULL    1   \n6   DERIVED likes   index   NULL    PRIMARY 6   NULL    1   Using index\n5   DERIVED reviews index   NULL    bnb_id  5   NULL    1   Using index\n4   DERIVED prices  ALL NULL    NULL    NULL    NULL    1   Using where\n3   DERIVED pics    ref is_cover    is_cover    2       11760   Using where\n2   DERIVED pos ALL PRIMARY NULL    NULL    NULL    10543   \n2   DERIVED bnbdata eq_ref  PRIMARY PRIMARY 3   db.pos.bnb_id   1   \n2   DERIVED bnb eq_ref  PRIMARY PRIMARY 3   db.pos.bnb_id   1   \n', 'is_cover', 'Using where', 'pics', 'pics']",False

2479886,Linked Tables not Updating in Access 2007,"I am running into an issue with a pair of linked tables in Access 2007. My intent is to create a new record on the one and have it generate a new one on the other. Perhaps I am over-estimating the ability of relationships in Access, but I have them set up as follows: So the relationship between the tables 'Contracts' and 'States' is one-to-one, set to enforce referential integrity, cascade update related fields, and only include where equal (I have also tried to use an include only from [Contracts] to [States]). I have a form for the user to enter Contracts.ContractID (and other info), but the States.ContractID isn't updating (the form control does update Contracts.ContractID), or rather there isn't a new record being created on the table.

2481017,error handling for jquery editable plugin,"[See update for a more precise specification ...] I recently started using the jquery jeditable plugin for my asp.net mvc app. So far so good. The last post at http://forums.asp.net/p/1541654/3789265.aspx has been incredibly useful and I ended up using it almost verbatim. However, the modeled error behavior is not quite right for my application. In case of an error, they throw away the change, revert the editable region to plain text, and pop up the error message as an alert. That's fine for short input but unacceptable for longer textarea input. My question: how can I change the onerror function to revert the editable area to a form seeded with the rejected input to allow for continuous edits? I guess as a starter I should remove the call to original.reset() but I am not sure what else to call to throw out the placeholder and revert the form. Thanks, Duffy [Update] Looks like the trick involves to avoid setting an indicator, then during onerror refocus on the input field. Unfortately my partial solution for onerror only works on IE. On firefox, focus() gets caught up in an ""ajaxError"" event. Question: how to I prevent the focus and ajaxError events from getting tangled up?

2811091,How can I make all Core Data objects inherit from my class rather than NSManagedObject?,"I created my own class that I want Core Data to use instead of : I can't use a category since this declares an ivar. All of my Core Data objects use concrete classes rather than being instances of . I use the code generator to generate these files. Here's an example of what a object might look like: I know that I can manually change to in this generated code, but I will need to do this every time I regenerate the code. Is there any way to make it automatically use my own class? Additionally, the in any solution might be a problem. Ideally I want it to use rather than , since is located in a library and the header needs a folder prefix to be accessible (e.g. ). I tried creating a dummy object in the file with the same name and specifying that all objects inherit from it, but there are two problems. The first is that it is using , which it can't find due to the reason I specified above. The second problem is that I'm not sure it's a good idea to fool Core Data into thinking the class is inheriting from another Core Data object... even if I'm not generating the code file. I'm guessing that Core Data might be doing some unnecessary things behind the scenes because it believes there is an extra class which my classes are inheriting from. I guess I can solve the first problem using another layer of classes. For example, I would specify that the objects inherit from and create a file in my project: ... and now my auto generated files will look like this: ... which will work. The only problem is the second one I mentioned above about extra code running behind the scenes in Core Data. Is this something to worry about or should I ignore it?

2914795,Bool field as a unique index,"Can a Bool field become a unique index and used for a foreign key relationship in conjunction with another table's index? I don't think it can become primary key but what about unique index? Every time I try to make it into a unique index it converts it into a tinyint. EDIT So I have a SQL relationship problem. Lets say I have a database where I want to keep records of information about individuals. Now I have setup a table to take on that information. Okay so far so good. Often times duplicate information can be discovered in the table and it would be removed. A record is considered a duplicate if a particular field has the same value as another field in another row. Example: Duplicate emails. Now I want to create another table in the database to keep track of every duplicate that is ever discovered and deleted. My first thought into this was to create a Foreign Key relationship. So I created and then connected a dupes table to my persons table. The relationship was a simple Foreign to Primary key relationship with an on delete constraint. Now while that may have worked at first the problem arose that the dupes table was receiving records that were deleted even if they were not deleted because they were dupes. This was a problem because even if I decided to delete a person from the persons table just because I did not like them, they would stored in the dupes table anyway. Then I thought, why not create a disposition field in the persons table and connect that as a unique or primary key to my dupes table's index foreign key.

2930232,Have MVC4 main site authenticate for web application/virtual directory,"I have an MVC4 (using razor) main site and then an asp.net webforms store that runs as a web application in a virtual directory. Can I have a forms authentication page in my MVC4 main site, authenticate the user and then upon authentication send them to the store AND if they try to browse directly to the virtual directory without yet being authenticated have it redirect them back to the MVC4 forms authentication page? So for instance: They go to www.mysite.com/account/login wherein it displays my nice log-in page running on MVC4 and part of the main site. After they successfully log-in it takes them to www.mysite.com/store/ (a web application/virtual directory) and since they've successfully authenticated it displays the store. And then on the flip site, if they're NOT YET authenticated and try to go directly to www.mysite.com/store/ (the web application/virtual directory) it redirects them back to the main site's forms authentication page at: www.mysite.com/account/login I have it authenticating the user just fine on my MVC4 forms authentication page (I've tested this and verified it works), the problem is that when I then redirect them to the store, the store doesn't see them as logged in and asked them to log in using the forms authentication page that the store contains (which has been built in web parts). I want to use the forms log-in page on my MVC4 site (as it's pretty looking and easier to control/update/code, etc). Is this a session issue?",[],False
2931307,Blacklist Shipping Address Logic,"I need some ideas for the logic behind a project I want to implement. Basically we have been having a problem with a few (under 10) ""customers"" using fraudulent credit cards. What happens is they use the credit card, (which is valid) to buy items and have them shipped to them. Then, the real card owner sees what was bought on their statement and disputes it leaving us to cover the cost of the goods we shipped. The ""customer"" in question uses different email addresses and different accounts everytime so its impossible for me to block his account. But he does use the same shipping address. So I was thinking maybe that was the best way to block him. Do you think the easiest way would be to create a table in the database with addresses we know are being used for fraudulent orders and cross check the address on every submit order. Or would there be an easier way to do this. We already verify credit cards upon entry but like i said before the cards are still valid-they aren't being reported as stolen.",[],False

When user logs in ip : members ip on registration/logins activationkey : i use md5 and a salt to create a unique activation key; length is always 32 chars gender : either blank or male/female and nothing else. websiteurl: can add they site url; msn : can contain msn email address (use regular expression to match this) aim : aim nickname (use regular expression to match this) yim : yim nickname (use regular expression to match this) twitter : twitter username (use regular expression to match this) suspended_note; first_name; last_name; date_time; ip; gender; websiteurl; msn; aim; yim; twitter can be null because on registration only username, email and password is required so those fields will be null until filled in (they are basically optional and not required) apart from ip which is taken on signup/login.

Username is unique and indexed like id as most of my selects compare have username in it with LIMIT 1 on my querys. UPDATE: Hi, im on mobile at moment so can't do much but wanted to ask if i changed to enum for example how would i do a select and compare query for example in php for enum? i did look online but cannot find any example queries with enum being used. Also if i changed date_time for example to timestamp do i still use time() in php to insert the unix timestamp into date_time column database? reason i ask is i was reading one tutorial online that says when the row is queried, selected, updated etc mysql automatically updates the timestamp for that row; is this true as i rather insert the timestamp using php time() in timestamp field. i use php time() already for date_time but use currently use varchar not timestamp. Plus server time is in US and in php.ini i set it to uk time but i guess mysql would store it in the time on the server which again is no good as i want them in uk time.

I have found far fewer examples where the next state is journalled and used to complete the transaction after a failure.

Is this the way it's supposed to be done? What if an application is already built and working and one simply wants to protect it all?

Shortly after though, I started noticing a 15 second delay between my requesting a page and its appearing in the browser. I asked their customer service people what was going on. They immediately blamed me and my PHP code. I carefully went over my PHP and improved some things and the delay appeared to go down to 5 seconds--still unacceptable. Then after a while, they delay went back up to 15 seconds. At some point, I tried accessing a basic HTML file that I had on their server and, lo and behold, the delay was something like 10 seconds. That's 10 seconds from plain HTML page request in the browser to its appearing in the browser. I called back and got the runaround, same as before, with them issuing demands that I tell them precisely when it was happening and promising to fix it. When I later offered that information, of course they did nothing about it and I canceled the service. This was my first experience using a hosting service and it really turned me off. My question is, what caused this huge delay? Is there a feature of Apache that permits putting a delay in there, or did they just overburden their servers? Mind you I did ask to be switched to a different server and they refused to allow it. Then I have a secondary question as to why this happens: I still have domains with this GoDaddy reseller and I've noticed that every once in a while, their domain masking service spits out an empty HTML file rather than providing the that would show my page-- which is hosted on my ISP's servers for free.

When tapping the icon the web site shows up in full screen mode (yay). To prevent all links on this web site to open up in safari and thereby go away from the full screen mode, I'm overriding the click event of all html anchors. This works great, but not on .NET linkbuttons, probably because they need to make a postback. This is my code: As you can see I'm trying to prevent this special behavior if the href contains ""doPostBack"" (which Linkbuttons do), or if they contain ""javascript"" (this is for links with e.g. onclick='xxx()'). This doesn't work though. Links created with Linkbutton doesn't respond, and I have no idea why. Any help at all is much appreciated.

3442569,Database Trigger Usage - Best Practices,"Brief Background: I currently maintain a fifteen year old inventory management system. In an effort to provide real-time quantity on hand for both single items and kits (possibly nested down to the Nth level), inventory is allocated to orders on the fly when a page is requested (allocation priority is determined by date received and date expected). Depending on how many orders are in the system, and more specifically, how many of those orders contain nested kits, performance can be an issue. The Question(s): We're currently in the process of designing a new inventory management system using SOA principles. Instead of allocating the inventory on the fly, we would like an allocation table to be updated after every insert, update, and delete occurs that could affect the items allocation data. There is some debate as to whether the allocation table should be updated by triggers in the DB, or by the C# order service. Which method would best adhere to SOA principles? Which method would be more performant? Is this the proper use of a trigger? Is either method generally accepted by the community at large as the ""proper way to do things""?

If I 'head' the file, it looks proper except for a ""&yuml;&thorn;"" at the beginning of the first line. If I open up the file in nano, however, I see the ""&yuml;&thorn;"" at the start and then ""^@"" before every character (even newlines and EoF). short.txt), this special encoding is preserved. I copied the first ten lines out of vi (which displays it properly) into my Windows clipboard via my SSH client, then pasted it into a new text file, test.txt. This file is visually identical when opened in vi (and similar through 'head', minus the ""&yuml;&thorn;""), although it's roughly half of the filesize.

3523609,Using Microstrategy on Highly Normalized SQL Server database,"I am interested in comments and insights relating to using Microstrategy to report against a complex snowflake SQL Server database comprising of several transactional, normalized (3NF) tables. Specifically, what is the best approach or the challenges on reporting in such an environment? Currently, there are some complex views that serve as analytical fact tables using complex SQL joins between the several transactional tables. The transactional tables also have their own dimensions, and so on. The views seem to work fine in SSRS. However, I have read that Microstrategy is not ideal for reporting against such a complex database (not due to performance of the tool, but more so because of the complexity of the SQL in building these metrics in Microstrategy). What would be the best approach on reporting in such an environment? Would building an SSAS cube on the current data warehouse be a good idea? Should reporting be done on the database, or should a new database or mart be created, specifically to be used by Microstrategy, with only the relevant views for basic reporting?

3659150,License validation and calling home,"I am developing an application that, when bought, can be activated using a license. Currently I am doing offline validation which is a bit troubling to me. I am aware there is nothing to do against cracks (i.e modified binaries), however, I am thinking to trying to discourage license-key pirating. Here is my current plan: When the user activates the software and after offline validation is successful, it tries to call home and validate the license. If home approves of the license or if home is unreachable, or if the user is offline, the license gets approved. If home is reached and tells the license is invalid, validation fails. Licensed application calls home the same way every time during startup (in background). If license is revoked (i.e pirated license or generated via keygen), the license get deactivated. This should help with piracy of licenses - An invalid license will be disabled and a valid license that was pirated can be revoked (and its legal owner supplied with new license). Pirate-users will be forced to use cracked version which are usually version specific and harder to reach. While it generally sounds good to me, I have some concerns: Users tend to not like home-calling and online validation. Would that kind of validation bother you? Even though in case of offline/failure the application stays licensed? It is clear that the whole scheme can be thwarted by going offline/firewall/etc. I think that the bother to do one of these is great enough to discourage casual license sharing, but I am not sure. As it goes in general with licensing and DRM variations, I am not sure the time I spend on that kind of protection isn't better spent by improving my product. I'd appreciate your input and thoughts.

However this usually requires the framework to include a CSS selector parser, because they need to support selectors, that the browser natively doesn't, foremost the frameworks own proprietary extensions. I would think that these parsers are large and slow. Wouldn't it be more efficient to have something that doesn't require a parser, such a chained method calls? Some like: instead of Are there any frameworks around that do something like this? And how do they compare with jQuery and friends in regard to performance and size?

I have a hierarchical table (e.g., ) and need to generate a sub-tree for an . This is trivially done with a recursive CTE. The difficulty is that, for each node, I need to compute a running bitwise-OR of a set of corresponding values, and then bit-OR that result with the same value for the parent node. This means every node inherits its parent's bitmask and may set its own additional bits. I can compute this value in the anchor member of the CTE using and a technique mentioned in an earlier question I asked. Unfortunately, I can't compute it the same way in the recursive part of the CTE because it uses and aggregates are not allowed there. Is there a way to restructure this to do what I want?

3767596,A characterisation of quadratic extensions contained in cyclic extensions of degree 4,"Let $D$ be a squarefree integer. I am trying to prove that $\mathbb Q[\sqrt D]$ is contained in a Galois extension of $\mathbb Q$ with Galois group $\mathbb Z/4$ if and only if $D$ is the sum of two squares, $D = a^2 + b^2$ with $a,b\in \mathbb Q$. The hint in the exercise in Dummit and Foote suggests considering the extension $\mathbb Q[\sqrt{s + s\sqrt D}]$ for the forward direction. However, I am unsure how to show that this extension is Galois, much less that its Galois group is cyclic of order 4. For the reverse direction, I expressed the given Galois extension as $\mathbb Q[\sqrt{a+b\sqrt D}]$ for some $a,b\in \mathbb Q$. I showed that this extension has $\mathbb Q[\sqrt{c^2 - d^2 D}]$ as a subfield for some $c,d \in \mathbb Q$. From this, I deduced that the $\sqrt D$ and $\sqrt{c^2 - d^2 D}$ generate the same extension, so $\sqrt D = x \sqrt{c^2 - d^2 D}$ for some $x$, and hence that $D = \frac{x^2 c^2}{1 + x^2 d^2} $. It seems that there should be a way to decompose this as a sum of two squares, but I did not see how. I did not tag this as homework as I am studying it independently.",[],False

3791373,Performant way to clone rather large subtree in database?,"Currently I'm trying to performance-optimize a code in a Windows Forms .NET 2.0 application that does copy operations on hierarchical database objects. Here is an example structure: Each object in a tree is represented by a database table row. In addition, for each object there are also several ""side-objects"" associated. E.g. a test case object also has 1..n permissions 1..n attributes 1..n attachments ... These ""side-objects"" are stored in separate database tables. Copying trees The user of the applications can select a tree element, right click and select ""copy"" then paste it later at another position in the tree. This operation copies all child objects and all ""side-objects"" to the new location. From a database perspective, this can be several hundred or even thousand and statements, depending on the size of the child tree to copy. From a user perspective, a progress dialog is being shown to keep the UI responsive. Beside that, most users complain that it takes way too long to do ""...a simple copy and paste..."" operation. Optimizing performance So my goal is to speed up things. The current algorithm goes something like this: Read an object from DB. Store this object as a new entry to DB. Do the same for all ""side-objects"" for the object. Recursively do the same for all child objects of the object. As you can imagine, for a large number of objects this quickly sums up to a large number of database operations. Since I have had no clue so far on how to optimize (batch operations? but then how and for which object?), my question is as following. My question Can you give me any hints/pattern/best practices on how to clone a large number of hierarchically related objects as described above?

This table has columns: an example of that data would be: id is auto incremented, is in text format (this is where I think i will be losing performance once the database is large)...

3811164,Canvas label and scroll issues,"I have been working on two different approaches to create a graphical canvas with html5 code, allowing graphical representation and horizontal scrolling of the graph. the canvas represents a timeline of sorts. as we scroll horizontally, the idea is to represent several years in the format of a timeline... example: say the historical development of computers... I m plotting points on the graph in reference to xy co-ordinates. this is currently se manually. later on I plan to make it based on sql queries. then as i scroll more, points plotted in future years/past years are displayed accordingly...giving it a continuous timeline feeling. I have been trying to attempt this with 2 approaches in html5 canvas..some have suggested using SVG, silverlight, GDI +.... approach 1:- http://jsfiddle.net/7KaKf/1/ method - a grid is created, points are plotted on the grid with a variable list, click mouse on the canvas - triggering is activated, drag canvas to scroll horizontally, click again on the canvas and scrolling is disabled. advantage to this approach - horizontal scrolling works like a charm!!! however, the issue in this approach is that i am not sure how to bind y axis lables on this grid such that every scrollable frame has a consistent label for both x axis and y axis. note: you can view my next approach to see what i mean by labels. approach 2:- http://jsfiddle.net/WNpKE/10/ The issue with the 2nd approach, is mostly like in the function that capture the mouse scrolling/dragging event and tries to repaint the canvas elements:- Another issue could be, even though timeline() is being recalled as the canvas scrolls, the grid is painted statically, between x = 65 and x = 930/ hence no other grid is being drawn. Although labeling is possible with this approach (which was proving to be difficult with the first approach), the grid is not consistent and once i scroll out of the first frame, the grid dissappears.... although the plotted points in the future are still visible when we scroll. In my first approach I use a grid that keeps repeating itself as we scroll on the canvas...however labeling becomes difficult with that...and in the 2nd approach, i label, however creating that style of repeating grid becomes difficult. I have come to quite the roadblock. somehow I need to combine both methods to create the solution. Can anyone help ? If someone could also give me links to cool canvas related theory material.

3835313,Cannot write to Apache www directory LAMP,"I've got Fedora 16 running Apache, PHP &amp; MySQL. I want to do 2 things: Share a directory within the www directory over Samba Use CMS systems that have automatic install/configure scripts I've successfully gotten apache running &amp; serving up webpages while still sharing the www directory over samba on a previous machine running the exact same version of Fedora, but this machine seems to be very stubborn. I had an issue sharing a different directory over Samba and figured out it was an SElinux issue. I had to change the SElinux label to ""samba_share_t"" in order to get that share to work. But the SElinux context for the www directory and subsequent directories is ""read all http scripts and the daemon"" so I'm pretty sure if I change that to the Samba Share, http will no longer work properly. So without the samba share working (and without FTP running) I'm having to place the files on the server through the physical box itself. As my local user I created a directory in www and placed files for a CMS system in there using fedora's file manager no problems. However when I go to run the install script for the CMS in the browser, I get errors saying ""cannot create file, check permissions"". The first was a CMS I had never used before so I figured it might be an issue with the CMS, however I tried installing another CMS and I get a similar error. With both tries I manually set the permissions for the www directory and all files enclosed all the way up 777, and set the owner to my own user (instead of root). Everything else required by the CMS (Apache, MySQL, PHP) is running fine and combined with the error I get when trying to access my /var/www samba share ""You do not have permission to access \SERVER\share"" I'm going with it's a permissions issue. What I don't understand is how I can still have a permissions issue when I've chmod'd the directory recursively all the way to 777?",[],False

The spreadsheet has about 10 different inputs (values a human enters in different cells of the spreadsheet) and then it outputs 5 independent calculations (in 5 different cells) based on that input. Their calculation is using some pre-entered data in the spreadsheet (about 100 different constants) and doing some look-ups on them. I would like to use this whole spreadsheet as a formula on a different spreadsheet to calculate a set of input values and produce the corresponding set of output values. Imagine this as creating different table with 10 columns for the input variables and 5 columns for the outputs, then copying each input into the other spreadsheet and copying back the output in the results table. For instance: A1, A2, A3,... A10 are cells where someone enters values through a series of calculations B1, B2, B3, B4 and B5 are updated with some formulas Can I use the whole series of calculations from A1...A10 into B1...B5 without creating one massive huge formula or a VBA macro?

This seems unsafe, but regardless if someone wanted to abuse it they could just go through the registration process and keep submitting incorrect CC numbers.. costing me money right? I dont remember if we put an IP limit on it, or again if that is even 100% safeguard. I am pretty sure we did something where if they enter mastercard with their number(temporarily stored) and it gets sent back as invalid it will match that and not allow them to keep entering the wrong 16 digit number. Should i just leave the page accessible without specific pages allowing access and worrying about IP limits instead?

4098059,GWT Spreadsheet Cell,"I am trying to reproduce the behavior of a spreadsheet cell using GWT. I was able to make a Composite widget called ""Cell"" which is by default a ""Label"" widget.

It would probably be easiest to just make my ""Cell"" a ""TextBox"" and just change the appearance to the user via CSS (according to whether they are entering data or not). However, I think that this will affect rendering time and so I revert to a ""Label"" widget whenever input is not necessary.

So as far as I can tell the only answer is to have an additional map which functions as an interner that I can check to see if a data object is still in memory: and the load function would be revised: However, using two maps instead of one for the cache seems inefficient.

The following new source file (compilation unit) will be generated: I'd like to copy all top-level import statements and static members and not static members of prototype-class.

Similarly I need to filter out @MyAnnotation annotation, and again it is represented with Tree.Kind.IDENTIFIER or Tree.Kind.MEMBER_SELECT.

Sadly we cant just switch to git as the mental capacity for some might be to overwhelming, so I was looking into git-svn to see if I could practically use that to solve the issue. Sadly that directly ends up in a bad situation as I want to break down each project into one git repo, and I don't want to have to recreate the git-svn checkout on each computer I work on. so I though perhaps there is an possibility to create some sort of transparent git ←→ svn proxy/gateway, so that an push to that repo ""commits"" to the svn repo, and an commit to the svn repo updates the git repo.

4303225,JQuery Mobile 1.0 - Self-posting pages causing duplicate dialogs or history entries,"If you go to http://jsbin.com/ibozun/2, hit ""Add Item,"" and then hit ""Save,"" you will see that a second dialog is opened on top of the first one. The form in the dialog is posting to itself (no action defined) - this is by design. Because the dialog has duplicated itself, now you have to hit ""Cancel"" 2 times to get it to close. The use-case for this setup is a MS MVC3 page with unobtrusive JQuery validation on it. The default scripts (in other words, I have no custom validators - the scripts are straight from MS) cause an ajax call to the server, and JQM treats that the same as a self-posting form - so you wind up with a duplicate dialog if validation fails. A similar thing happens if the second page as a page, rather than a dialog - the form posting to itself results in a second history entry in the browser, so to get back to page 1, you have to hit back 2 times. I believed this be a bug in JQM, but after submitting a bug on GitHub, I was told that this is the expected behavior. So, assuming this behavior that will not be changing in the framework, how do I prevent this from happening for my instance (preferring NOT to edit the framework JS)? Do I have to write my own ajax calls for validation so that I can prevent JQM from knowing that anything has happened? That seems unfortunate... One idea I had was to detect that the nextPage and current page are the same on ""pageHide"", and manipulate the dialog/history myself, but have had no luck. Thanks in advance!",[],False

4352865,"Which is better for repeated user notifications: A series of broadcasts, a started service or a bound service?","I'm currently developing an android application that will repeatedly ask a question to the user in randomly determined time intervals. This means it will wake up the device if nessecary, pop up an Activity, make a sound or vibration and let the user choose one of the options. The user will be able to turn the series of pop ups on or off. The user will also be able to temporarily turn it off for a self-determined period of time. Lastly the user will be able to specify designated times of the day in which the series of pop ups will turn on or off automatically. I already know how to schedule Activities and BroadcastReceivers with AlarmManager. I also know how to wake the device up by looking at the source code for the alarm clock on android. My question is how to best implement it with the Android framework. When the pop up series start my application needs to randomly determine in which interval the next pop up will occur. When the time has come for the notification to be displayed. The Activity will pop up (already implemented) and immedeately the next pop up time will be randomly calculated. When the user has not answered the question in the pop up when it is already time for the next pop up, the application must know that. The application must also be able to determine when is has to start and stop its pop ups as specified by the user. At all these points something must be called. I'm wondering if I could best do all this with a BroadcastReceiver receiving a series of different actions by Intent. Or should I use a Service doing all the work. And if I use a service is it best to send it different commands through or should I rather bind to it and call the methods through the Binder? I found the source for the alarm clock rather confusing on this matter and I'm unsure which method is the best. They all seem to have their strong and weak points. Services can have 'states', but the system may decide to destroy it to free memory, thus losing this data. Scheduled BroadcastReceivers will be remembered by the AlarmManager, but they are 'stateless'. With bound Services you can communicate both ways, but it takes some time to accuire the Binder. Started services can be given quick commands through , but cannot directly communicate with Activities. The decision remains hard...","['onStartCommand()', 'onStartCommand()']",False

Getting the column names in sqlite is easy enough, but I'm not sure if I should store the resulting names (and longer descriptions) as another table in the db or in a list of some sort in the application. If it were another table in the db, I think I would have to store the column name as a string... unless there is some way to reference a column in SQL?

4432989,Is it *really* possible to directly steal a private key if it uses no passphrase?,"I've read in various places, such as in this question that using an ssh key pair without a passphrase allows attackers to steal your private key if they gain access to your account. I assumed that by ""steal"" it meant they could fairly easily do a brute-force attack to try every possible private key until they found one that matched the public key stored in your account. But the accepted answer on the question above assumes that the private keys are essentially stored in plain text somewhere. This is contrary to what I've always understood to be the case: that since (normally) you wouldn't store your private key on the server--only your public key--the main security risk posed by not using a passphrase is that someone could steal the private key off of your local machine and then use it without needing to also know the passphrase.

(Here.) Now I think I have a more difficult question. There is a theorem (easy to prove) which says For a module $M$ and its endomorphism $f,$ $f$ is a von Neumann regular element of $End(M)$ iff $\ker f$ is a direct summand of $M$ and at the same time $\operatorname{im} f$ is a direct summand of $M.$ I would like to know if there are any useful (or even less useful) necessary and/or sufficient conditions for $\ker f$ is a direct summand of $M;$ $\operatorname{im} f$ is a direct summand of $M.$ I understand that this is technically open-ended and I can't know exactly what the scope of it is, but based on my (not that great) mathematical experience, I believe this is not a real issue here. However, if I am wrong and this is a very broad subject, please just give me some references and a short outline of the most important facts if it's possible. I would be especially grateful for a condition that would be equivalent to (a) but didn't use the standard notion of a kernel, but used the notion of the kernel being an equivalence relation (congruence).

4665278,Keeping reference of Controller in View or using listener,"I am reading what I think a seminal article about Model-View-Controller (MVC) using Java (lots of people on here already referred to it when discussing about MVC). http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/javase/mvc-136693.html Basically, it presents a modified MVC flow, with the Model sending notifications to Controller (not View, as in the traditional way). Controller then passes the notifications on to View for interface updates, or inteprets user interactions' commands and send back to Model. I have a question regarding the way Controller and View work in tandem. In this article, the author kept a reference to Controller in both of his Views, and directly called methods of Controller in these Views. I was wondering about the rational behind it. Why didn't he implement some ActionListeners in Controller, and let interaction widgets in the Views send signals to these listeners? Thanks for your help.",[],False

4731529,Create Management VLAN on SAN switch,"We have a virtual stack set up in the following manner (simplified for brevity): SAN. In working with VMWare support, they couldn't stress enough that we have all our SAN traffic separated from everything else. So all the management, vMotion, and VM traffic stays on that first set of switches. The only traffic on the SAN switches is the ports assigned to the iSCSI adapter and to the SAN controllers. The SAN traffic is on 192.168.10.0/24 and everything else is on 192.168.11.0/24. I've now realized that I can't log in to manage the SAN switches unless I physically plug into it, or if I create a VM on the same vSwitch that the iSCSI adapters are on, which in both cases mixes ""normal"" traffic with the iSCSI traffic. So they suggest setting up a separate VLAN on the SAN switch for management. And that's where I have the problem. I picked a port on the SAN switch, created a new VLAN 10, and tagged the port for that vlan. This automatically marked it as Forbidden for the default vlan, so it's now separated from the iSCSI traffic. I also configured vlan 10 to have an IP address in the 192.168.11.0/24 network (the same as everything else on switch 1). I then place an uplink from that port up to switch 1, create the same vlan, set the port to ""General"" mode (is this a Dell thing?), have it untagged for the default vlan 1, and tagged for vlan 10, with the PVID set to 10. I then plug my my laptop in to another port in switch 1, make it tagged for VLAN 10... but nothing. I can't ping nor pull up the admin portal for the SAN switch. What part of the vlan tagging am I not understanding? On the SAN switch, it's set to Access and Tagged with vlan 10, so that should be the only traffic allowed on it. Then on the uplink on switch 1, I assigned it to General mode, untagged default, tagged vlan 10, and pvid 10. So this should allow access from any port from vlan 1 or 10, if it comes in untagged, it tags it as 10, and it should be able to forward the data when I request the IP of the vlan on the SAN switch. But obviously it's not, so where am I going wrong?",[],False

4874298,How do I access information from multiple associated models in the Controller in an effiecient manner?,"First, some background. My application models are like so: Subscription is a join table used to store information such as state (:active, :inactive, :failed, :passed, :unpaid) as well as serve as a connector to all the information that comes with taking a course (such as the Grade model(not yet added), the Payment model(work in progress), etc). I want to add the Payment model to store a history of payments on a subscription. Each payment can be for one or more subscriptions. So far, I've tried a , but I'm having trouble with the controller logic and I'm thinking maybe there's a better way to associate the models for ""a Payment from a User on a Subscription to a Course."" Technically speaking, in a payment show action, I would need information from each of these models (course.name, user_id of user who paid, payment.amount, all of which are connected to a Subscription) and in a Payment.create action, I'd need to set the state of the subscription (that I can do). If this is a logical/efficient way to associate the various models, how do I access the needed information(some information from each model course, user, payment, and subscription) in the Payment show action with minimal database calls? I'm using and would like to stick with ActiveRecord/ARel instead of straight sql statements. I'm open to ""you're doing it wrong"" answers as well. If changing the associations will make it more efficient to access the tables from the controller, I'm open to that as well.","['  User has_many :subscriptions; has_many :courses, :through =&gt; :subscriptions\nSubscription belongs_to :course, :user\n  Course has_many :subscriptions; has_many :users, :through =&gt; :subscriptions\n', 'Payment has_many :subscriptions', 'Rails 3.2/Ruby 1.9']",True

I have done alot on searching online and found methods for doing countif etc.. but nothing deal with formula entry for the Custom criteria. Is anyone able to help? Thanks, J Thanks for the quick reply DanB but its not exactly what I am trying to achieve. My end goal is that my application can pass a value into the file (Column A Row 1 [If easier for formatting it can go into each row in coloumn A which is populated but not required]) and the file will be saved locally. The user will then be entering details in Column B, C, D, E, etc... on their local machine, saving it and processing the file again. I want the application to check Row 1 Col A for the value and decide on how to process the remainer of the file based on this value (the reading the values in the file works already). Because each time my application generates a file it will be unique I want to try do the Data Validation using a formula in the cell so that I can write it using my application and not have to manually apply settings to the file. Is it possible to do this kind of validation using only formulas in the cell when populating it? Thanks again, J","['Data &gt; Data Validation &gt; Custom &amp; enter """"']",False

I assume this happens because on postback, the controls are all rendered, the nodes are then again expanded, and only at the end of the process, the scripts are executed, at which point method RememberClickedState() does not see the correct nodes anymore.

One of the things I have set up is a wildcard subdomain for my main site, which are later mapped to userspace. However, I also have static subdomains. I am under the impression that the static subdomains need to live above the wildcard in my configuration so if one of the static subdomains is accessed, apache uses the correct virtual host instead of hitting the wildcard.

4948115,Migration strategy of source code from one project to another using GIT,"I like to reuse some code of a GIT maintained project for another project. The working code is a good kickstart to the new project, despite most of it would come obsolete for the new needs. So the question is what would be the best practice for handling that?

After stripping the code to match the needed basic funcitonality of the new project do the first commit to keep it's history clean from useless things. Maybe it takes some time to conform this goal. Also, there is no way to merge enhancements done in the old project. Branch the old code and adapt it to it's new job step by step. That means the two projects will stay entangled inside one repository, that has one name, one README on GitHub etc. Create the new project, beginning with a minimal main part, and another library project, serving as a common collection for both the old and the new project.

On next load, it checks to see if the key is set, and if it is, it grabs data from it, instead of DB. Except it doesnt always do that... it still runs the query, about 1/2 the time, regardless of the key being set or not. They keys that are set, dont always expire when they are set to expire either either. And the command that deletes a key from the cache, doesn't always do that either.

This means that it can't authenticate to our TFS deployment when executing ""tf.exe view"" to utilize our Source Server for debugging. Team Explorer manages to authenticate to TFS using a UI prompt, however I suspect that it's because we supply it with the TFS deployment's URI, and it's designed to display a prompt to facilitate workgroup scenarios; i.e. it's not like we're getting it for free.

5212195,Good Mercurial workflow for a team of 15 developers,"I'm in a team of 15 developers currently using Allfusion Harvest. We're not happy with it and looking around we've decided to switch to Mercurial due to the available frontends TortoiseHg and MercurialEclipse. We're currently using a twelve year old release of Harvest and I find our current workflow hard to translate to Mercurial. I have previous experience with ClearCase where we used a model similar to: Where the left trunk is unstable, middle is test and right is stable. Now I have no problem recreating this branching model in Mercurial (in one central repository). The idea is that the developers then clone this repository, branch out from unstable, do their work and then merge with unstable. Reading on the web I've yet to see a Mercurial work flow aimed at teams larger than three developers so I'm unsure if this is a good workflow. So two questions: Is this a good working model? How do you work with Mercurial and how many are there in your team?",['A  A  A\n|  |  |\nB  C  |\n| /|  |\nC  |  E\n|  | /  \nD  E\n| /\nE\n'],False

My question is: what is the smallest number of elements that $W$ may contain (as a function of dim$(X) = n$) ? Quite simply, we can observe that $n + {n \choose 2}$ would form an upper bound for the minimal cardinality of $W$.

5234668,How to show a NULL value instead of deleting the entire row when the selected variable isn't there,"I'm trying to link two tables in the same database using a third.

5296187,Virtualization versus simple consolidation of a web infrastructure,"After talking to a friend who works for a virtualization firm, I started to think whether it could be of benefit to my small company. Right now we have our IIS web server on one server, and our SQL database on another. What he was saying is that with virtualization you could put both operating systems and application stacks onto one piece of physical hardware and then just get a massive big server with lots of CPU, RAM, and RAID 5 or 10 for redundancy. This saves us on the costs of buying essentially duplicate amounts of hardware to backup each IIS and database server (I think?) This all sounds fine and dandy, but what is the difference compared to me simply installing IIS onto my SQL Server and serving websites/data on the same box with 1 operating system? To me I save the overhead of having a virtualization environment, but achieve the same goal. Also, are there not performance concerns with having all your eggs in one server-basket? One disadvantage that I could see is that it would be more difficult to split those two ""logical"" servers at some point down the road.

The fact is, when I change the assembly name from ASSEMBLY_XXX to ASSEMBLY_YYY and register it using RegAsm, the former one is still registered (if not explicitly unregistered) and the new one is added on top. This sucks as Excel get mixed up between assemblies when the same classes are exposed via COM.

The startup time is kinda long (mostly due to many database requests to a remote server, which take 5 - 10 seconds, and even more since my users usually have too much applications running...) and I'd like to set up a way to hide &amp; show my application when needed. Exit). All users are launching an installer which is checking the version installed, then the version available online, and update the app if needed before launching it. Now, I'd like it to first check on the process monitor (the one found in Task Manager, Processes tab), and if a process is already running for the application, it'll just show the window again. Otherwise, if no process is running, we can process the classic-check-for-update-then-launch steps. This would especially remove a lot of stupid customer requests I regularly have (""hey, your application takes too long to load, so I clicked on it again 5 times and it launched 6 instances!!!!"" :/ ) and therefore save me a lot of useless time spent asking them to stop launching 50 instances of the same application cause it won't make it any faster...

And am kinda burnt out thinking about the naming convention to follow for API's. I am looking for suggestions and ideas for improving the naming convention.

Selects a vehicle and add's a journey. This journey has various parameters like start gps, end gps, start time, end time. A subscriber, add's his user details. And performs a search, and gets a list of journey's. Selects one journey and ""calls a SubscribeToThisJourney"". If the subscriber needs to list the providers he has subscribed to, he calls ""SubsribeToThisJourneyList"" The provide who received his subscription request, can call, ""SubscriberList"". And selects one or many subscribers using ""AcceptSubscription"". And call ""AcceptSubscriptionList"". The subscriber calls SubscribeToThisJourneyList with .isAccepted to know if the request was accepted by the provider. I am also about to release JSON endpoints, so the impact will be huge for changing anything at a later point Now all this provider, subscriber can be very confusing for developers.

5930914,Constructing a Tangent Space Functor,"This is a follow up of this question I asked some time ago regarding the tangent space functor. I am wondering though if there is a simpler way that this situation can be characterized without formally invoking all of the machinery of vector bundles. Given any manifolds $M$ and $N$ and $p \in M$, any smooth map $F$ between $M$ and $N$ induces a linear map, the pushforward, $F_{*}:T_pM \rightarrow T_{F(p)}N$ between tangent spaces such that $F_*(X_p)f = X_p(f \circ F)$ for all tangent vectors $X_p \in T_pM$ and smooth functions $f \in C^{\infty}(N)$. The pushforward satisfies the functorial properties $(G \circ F)_{*} = G_{*} \circ F_{*}$ and $(1_M)_* = 1_{T_pM}$. As I understand the situation, the only thing needed to turn this setup into a functor is a way of assigning each point $p \in M$ to the tangent space $T_pM$. The tangent space $T_pM$ is an element of the tangent bundle $TM$ considered as a disjoint union of all tangent spaces to $M$. Furthermore, at each point $p \in M$ we can use the natural inclusion to assign $M$ its tangent space $T_pM$. It seems this assignment with the pushforward comprises a functor between smooth manifolds and tangent spaces. Is my understanding of the situation accurate? By construction, I realize that this isn't precisely the same tangent functor that Lee defines in Introduction to Smooth Manifolds but is my assement accurate that it is, in fact, a functor?",[],False

5988542,Writing contents of NSMutableArray to plist file,"So theres a page in my app where a large textfield appears, and the user inputs text and hits the save button. When the save button is hit, an NSMutableArray called savedPosts, which is declared in the AppDelegate file, saves the text content of the textfield to this array. This saving code is being called from some other view controller, not the AppDelegate, even though the actual array is declared in the AppDelegate. I'm not sure if that's a bad idea, but that's still not the issue. Anyway, I want it so that every time the user hits the save button on a new or existing post, it adds another object to the array and saves that same object to the plist. What would be the best way to set up this whole thing-to save posts from a textfield to an array which saves it automatically to the plist. How do I make it add an object to the plist file every time it is added to the array. Where should the array be declared and allocated?",[],False
