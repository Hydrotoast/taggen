1002,SQL 2005 Security - Users: What are they used for? (and other various questions),"I am not a DBA and so dont really know anything about SQL 2005 security settings, etc. I am attempting to set up an empty copy of our database by generating the full database from SQL Management Studio generated scripts. Unfortunately I don't know what many of the options do and the MSFT documentation of this processes isn't great. There is an option to generate script for Schemas, Tables, Views and Users. It is the users I am confused about, because I don't understand how they affect the usage of the database. We have some developers in the team who are in this list and some who are not, yet everyone can do anything on the database, at least when they are hosting it on their own machines. Do I need to keep these Users in my new generated database and what do they do? We also have a dbo User who is a db_owner and owns many of our schemas. What is this dbo User? What is the significance of a user Owning Schemas? We use Schemas as ""namespaces"" to group logically related tables in our database but I take it there is more to them than that? There is also a username tied to this dbo User, its the windows NT login of one of our developers, but he doesn't have his own User object in the list...is there any significance to this? Is this a bad thing? Other Users are guest, INFORMATION_SCHEMA and sys, but I think these are all defaults? Sorry but I am a SQL admin ignoramus and usually left these things to the DBA in my previous job! Thanks for any help.",[],False
2061,Foreign key constraint with UTF-8,"I recently converted my database to UTF-8, which it should have been in the first place.

I've made a good 12 failed attempts but the account doesn't seem to be locking. Could someone list each view, model, controller, etc. that needs to be modified and how to modify it?

211576,advice on nested Java try/finally code sandwiches,"I would like some advice on a technique I bumped onto. It can be easily understood by looking at the code snippets, but I document it somewhat more in the following paragraphs. Using the ""Code Sandwich"" idiom is commonplace to deal with resource management. Used to C++'s RAII idiom, I switched to Java and found my exception-safe resource management resulting in deeply nested code, in which I have a really hard time getting grip on the regular control flow. Apparently (java data access: is this good style of java data access code, or is it too much try finally?, Java io ugly try-finally block and many more) I'm not alone. I tried different solutions to cope with this: maintain the program state explicitly: , ..., and cleanup conditionally: ... But I shun duplicating the program state in explicit variables - the runtime knows the state, and I don't want to care for it. wrap every nested block in functions - results in even harder to follow control flow, and makes for really awkward function names: , , ... And finally I arrived at an idiom also (conceptually) backed by some research paper on code sandwiches: Instead of this: Using a helper construction, you may arrive at a more linear construct, in which compensation code is right next to the originator. And the nested code becomes linear: I was delighted: no matter how many exceptional paths, the control flow stays linear, and the cleanup code is visually next to the originating code.

234631,"Single PHP ""exit;"" statement prevents HTML5 video in Safari","Bizarre bug: in a PHP script that serves video files, I have a few test conditions (authenticate token, make sure file exists, etc.) before sending a ""video/mp4"" header and outputting an MP4 file. If any of the tests fail, is given a non-false value. At the end of the tests there's this statement: This code works as expected in Chrome, but not in Safari. However (and believe me, I've tested this every which way), if I simply comment out , as in: ... the code works perfectly in Safari — the video immediately starts loading. I'm sure that that block is never entered, otherwise the script would stop executing, and I wouldn't be seeing the header (not to mention, it wouldn't work in Chrome). Further, whatever PHP is doing behind the scenes should be totally transparent to the browser. I thought maybe there was some issue with output, but I would have received a warning if I had outputted anything before the headers. I've been seeing this behavior consistently for days — I've checked it probably 25 times in disbelief. Surely there's something I'm missing? UPDATE To clarify the problem, I changed the code a bit: Now we're guaranteed to hit the statement, and output ""Fail"". Here are the headers, as seen by Safari: (""Fail"" is outputted as expected, too.) Now, when I comment-out , the headers change to: But the video still won't play! (QuickTime logo with a question mark over it.) I think that's evidence enough that remains false, and that is never executed. Now, get this: if I again comment out (functionally equivalent to ), so that my final code is: ... the video plays in Safari! UPDATE 2 If I change the code to: ... to absolutely guarantee that is , it plays in Safari! This behavior makes no sense to me, b/c if was being set due to one of my verification conditions, then it would never output the header, as when I explicitly set to — and instead it would output a page with the word ""Fail"" — right? UPDATE 3 Here's all of the relevant code, just to be totally clear: HOPEFULLY THE LAST UPDATE / SUMMARY This question is probably already too long, but I thought I'd try one last time to summarize how weird this is. There are 3 distinct responses: 1) If I hardwire a before , just so I have a baseline for failure, I get a header, and the word ""Fail"" is outputted as expected. 2) If I leave the code as it is above, I get a header, but a broken video in Safari (it will play in Chrome). 3) Finally (and this is based on new testing I did today), if I comment out in the token-verification conditional, I get a header, and the video plays in Safari. Now, I figured there must something wrong with the token verification — but when I hardwire in another test to echo the value of $fail after the test, it's still false! The conditional is never entered (I also just put a straight instead of — and I still get a header). I simply cannot believe that commenting out code that never gets executed could cause a distinct response — and furthermore, that it would play in Chrome, but not in Safari; whatever's happening server-side with PHP should be completely transparent to the browser. Crazy. AHA! I added some logging to my script, and it turns out that when serving HTML5 video, the browser makes two requests. Here's the two (successful) requests from Chrome: And here's the two from Safari (first successful, 2nd fails): I have to go out right now, but I'm almost certain this behavior is the root of the bug. For some reason, the 2nd Safari request can't find the token.","['$fail', 'if', 'if ($fail) {\n    exit;\n}\n', 'exit;', 'if ($fail) {\n    //exit;\n}\n', 'if', 'video/mp4', ""$fail = true;\nif ($fail) {\n    die('Fail');\n}\n"", 'die()', 'Connection:Keep-Alive\nContent-Type:text/html\nDate:Thu, 24 Jun 2010 23:31:28 GMT\nKeep-Alive:timeout=10, max=29\nServer:Apache/2.2.15 (CentOS) mod_ssl/2.2.15 0.9.8l DAV/2 mod_auth_passthrough/2.1 FrontPage/5.0.2.2635\nTransfer-Encoding:Identity\nX-Powered-By:PHP/5.2.13\n', '$fail = true;', 'Connection:Keep-Alive\nContent-Length:47406944\nContent-Type:video/mp4\nDate:Thu, 24 Jun 2010 23:32:58 GMT\nKeep-Alive:timeout=10, max=30\nServer:Apache/2.2.15 (CentOS) mod_ssl/2.2.15 0.9.8l DAV/2 mod_auth_passthrough/2.1 FrontPage/5.0.2.2635\nX-Powered-By:PHP/5.2.13\n', '$fail', 'die()', 'die()', 'exit', ""//$fail = true;\nif ($fail) {\n    //die('Fail');\n}\n"", ""$fail = false;\nif ($fail) {\n    die('Fail');\n}\n"", '$fail', 'false', '$fail', 'video/mp4', '$fail', 'true', 'text/html', ""// verify\n$fail = false;\n$token = false;\n$file_name = [rest assured that $file_name is correct];\nif (!$file_name) {\n    $fail = true;\n} else {\n    $file_name = '../video/'.$file_name;\n}\nif (!isset($_REQUEST['ts'])) {\n    $fail = true;\n}\nif (isset($_POST['token']) || isset($_GET['token'])) {\n    $token = isset($_POST['token']) ? $_POST['token'] : $_GET['token'];\n} else if (isset($_COOKIE['token'])) {\n    $token = $_COOKIE['token'];\n}\nif ($token != md5(SALT_HASH.$_REQUEST['ts'])) {\n    $fail = true;\n}\nif (((int)($_REQUEST['ts']) + 60 * 10) &lt; mktime()) {\n    $fail = true;\n}\nif (!is_file($file_name)) {\n    $fail = true;\n}\nif ($fail) {\n    die('Fail');\n}\n\n// output\n$file_size = (string)(filesize($file_name));\nheader('Content-Type: video/mp4');\nheader('Content-Length: '.$file_size);\nreadfile_chunked($file_name);\nexit;\n"", '$fail = true;', ""if ($fail) die('Fail');"", 'text/html', 'video/mp4', '$fail = true;', 'video/mp4', ""die('!');"", '$fail = true;', 'video/mp4', 'Fri Jun 25 17:41:22 2010 Browser: [Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_4; en-US) AppleWebKit/533.4 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/5.0.375.86 Safari/533.4] Fail: [0] Token: [83e50b519c0ed4662b6b7fabb8f6671e] Timestamp: [1277509282]\nFri Jun 25 17:41:22 2010 Verification passed\n\nFri Jun 25 17:41:22 2010 Browser: [Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_4; en-US) AppleWebKit/533.4 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/5.0.375.86 Safari/533.4] Fail: [0] Token: [83e50b519c0ed4662b6b7fabb8f6671e] Timestamp: [1277509282]\nFri Jun 25 17:41:22 2010 Verification passed\n', 'Fri Jun 25 17:41:32 2010 Browser: [Apple Mac OS X v10.6.4 CoreMedia v1.0.0.10F569] Fail: [0] Token: [6374fba3d9eac7d94de9741db76953c6] Timestamp: [1277509291]\nFri Jun 25 17:41:32 2010 Verification passed\n\nFri Jun 25 17:41:33 2010 Browser: [QuickTime/7.6.6 (qtver=7.6.6;cpu=IA32;os=Mac 10.6.4)] Fail: [1] Token: [] Timestamp: [1277509291]\n']",False

I have found this MVC framework: http://blogs.msdn.com/priozersk/archive/2008/10/10/mobile-mvc-framework-part-1.aspx Is this the current hotness? Our needs include: - support for different langauges - support for different resolutions (QVGA, VGA, but possibly 640x200, 800x600) - editable grids - preferably having a local database on the devices, perhaps SQL Server CE - it has to be fast, so the infrastructure needs to come with a minimal amount of gunk - is the best backend still an asmx web service? WCF does not seem to support very many bindings for Compact Framework out of the box. I would like an MVC approach so we can replace the views if needed.

354416,Mercurial: Why do I sometimes need to merge after a pull rather than simply updating?,"When I first started using hg, update seemed to have an almost magical ability to take newly-pulled changes and integrate them into my local repo. Lately, however, I notice that even if my local changes are non-conflicting with the newly-pulled changes from somewhere else, I always have to merge, resulting in an extra changeset that duplicates a bunch of changes I already have in one of my local codelines (heads). I want to understand what it is that provokes hg to require a merge, instead of just smooshing all the changes together with update. A conflict should clearly require a merge. What else?",[],False

403040,Is Lindeberg's condition satisfied when variances of the sequence of r.v.'s are bounded from above and below?,"This question is related to my previous question but I think it's sufficiently different to warrant a separate one. Suppose I have a sequence of independently distributed positive random variables: $X_1\sim A_1,X_2\sim A_2, \ldots, X_n\sim A_n$, where $A_i$'s have support over $[0,\infty)$. Furthermore, suppose that, for each $X_i$, variance $\sigma_{lb}^2&lt;\sigma_i^2&lt;\sigma_{ub}^2$, that is variances of $X_i$'s are bounded from below and above. Does Lindeberg's Condition: $$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{s_n^2}\sum_{i=1}^n\int_{\{|x-\mu_i|&gt;\epsilon s_n\}}(x-\mu_i)^2f_i(x)dx=0$$ hold in this case? Here $s_n^2=\sum_{i=1}^n\sigma_i^2$ and $s_n=\sqrt{s_n^2}$. My intuition tells me that it does, for the following reason: suppose that it doesn't hold. That means there is some random variable $X_i$ in the sequence most of whose mass isn't centered in an interval about the mean $[\mu_i-\epsilon s_n,\mu_i+\epsilon s_n]$. However, this interval gets larger as we add more random variables to the sequence, since their variances are bounded from below. Since the variance of $X_i$ is upper-bounded, at some $n$, the interval $[\mu_i-\epsilon s_n,\mu_i+\epsilon s_n]$ should ""consume"" most of $X_i$'s mass. However, I am not sure how to prove (or disprove) it. One problem may arise if the interval $[\mu_i-\epsilon s_n,\mu_i+\epsilon s_n]$ does not increase fast enough... Not sure if I need additional conditions on higher moments of $A_i$ or not...",[],False

420756,Python to emulate remote tail -f?,"We have several application servers, and a central monitoring server. We are currently running ssh with ""tail -f"" from the monitoring server to stream several text logfiles in realtime from the app servers. The issue, apart from the brittleness of the whole approach is that killing the ssh process can sometimes leave zombie tail processes behind. We've mucked around with using -t to create pseudo-terminals, but it still sometimes leaves the zombie processes around, and -t is apparently also causing issues elsewhere with the job scheduling product we're using. As a cheap-and-dirty solution until we can get proper centralised logging (Logstash and RabbitMQ, hopefully), I'm hoping to write a simple Python wrapper that will start ssh and ""tail -f"", still capture the output, but store the PID to a textfile on disk so we can kill the appropriate tail process later if need be. I at first tried using subprocess.Popen, but then I hit issues with actually getting the ""tail -f"" output back in realtime (which then needs to be redirected to a file) - apparently there are going to be a host of blocking/buffer issues. A few sources seemed to recommend using pexpect, or pxssh or something like that. Ideally I'd like to use just Python and it's included libraries, if possible - however, if a library is really the only way to do this, then I'm open to that. Is there a nice easy way of getting Python to start up ssh with ""tail -f"", get the output in realtime printed to local STDOUT here (so I can redirect to a local file), and also saving the PID to a file to kill later? Or even if I don't use ssh with tail -f, some way of still streaming a remote file in (near) realtime that includes saving the PID to a file? Cheers, Victor EDIT: Just to clarify - we want the tail process to die when we kill the SSH process. We want to start ssh and ""tail -f"" from the monitoring server, then when we Ctlr-C that, the tail process on the remote box should die as well - we don't want it to stay behind. Normally ssh with -t should fix it, but it isn't fully reliable, for reasons I don't understand, and it doesn't play nicely with our job scheduling. Hence, using screen to keep the process alive at the other end is not what we want.",[],False

462979,How to write a very basic compiler,"Possible Duplicate: Best Online resources to learn about Compilers? What would be the best way to learn about compilers, and executable formats? Advanced compilers like compile codes into machine readable files according to the language in which the code has been written (e.g. C, C++, etc). In fact, they interpret the meaning of each codes according to library and functions of the corresponding languages. Correct me if I'm wrong. I wish to better understand compilers by writing a very basic compiler (probably in C) to compile a static file (e.g. Hello World in a text file). I tried some tutorials and books, but all of them are for practical cases. They deal with compiling dynamic codes with meanings connected with the corresponding language. How can I write a basic compiler to convert a static text into a machine readable file? The next step will be introducing variables into the compiler; imagine that we want to write a compiler which compile only some functions of a language. Introducing practical tutorials and resources is highly appreciated :-)",['gcc'],False

464018,IOI 2003 : how to calculate the node that has the minimum balance in a tree?,"here is the Balancing Act problem that demands to find the node that has the minimum balance in a tree. Balance is defined as : Deleting any node from the tree yields a forest : a collection of one or more trees. Define the balance of a node to be the size of the largest tree in the forest T created by deleting that node from T For the sample tree like : 2 6 1 2 1 4 4 5 3 7 3 1 Explanation is : Deleting node 4 yields two trees whose member nodes are {5} and {1,2,3,6,7}. The larger of these two trees has five nodes, thus the balance of node 4 is five. Deleting node 1 yields a forest of three trees of equal size: {2,6}, {3,7}, and {4,5}. Each of these trees has two nodes, so the balance of node 1 is two. What kind of algorithm can you offer to this problem? Thanks",[],False

598675,"What does the 'new' keyword actually do in Java, and should I avoid creating new objects?","I signed up a few moments ago, though I've been making great use of this site since I took up computer programming, which I've been teaching myself and consider a little hobby of mine. I did look up for similar questions, but in fact I couldn't find the answer I was seeking for. Now, being aware that, in Java (that's the language I was suggested to start off with), it is considered good programming practise to declare and instantiate variables as you need them, please consider the following lines: Now, suppose I invoke myMethod(), say, 10 times while running my program, how does that work? Is a new object create every time? Is the myObject variable reallocated every time? Does the complier skip that like of code as it sees that the object has already been created and the variable myObject already been assigned to such object? In a nutshell: should I write code like that only if I plan to invoke that method only once? I know... shame on me for asking such a stupid question, but please give me a chance!

And wow that confused me, a lot, I guess that's due to the fact that I've been teaching myself so... Anyways, isn't it useless to create a Object for the variable every time? I mean, if i want to use the myObject variable throughout my program, shouldn't I declare it Once And For All? maybe in another method, that I'm going to invoke only once? Because as far as I understand, every time i invoke a new object is creating, thus overriding myObject's own properties aka variables or am I just talking nonsense? --------------------------- edited ----------------------------- My doubts came after reading this code from some website I can't remember right now: I mean, why not declare FileWriter, FileReader, BufferedReader and BufferedWriter at the top of the class as they did for the other variables? and why not initialise them as well maybe in the constructor?

The basic idea is that when internal, authenticated users in the domain accesses a page, it will be as per normal. However, should external users try to access it, it will direct them to a login page, interface with Active Directory, and redirect them to the page upon correct authentication. In order to make it work, I have tried to modify Web.xml to allow form authentication with the built-in ""j_security_check"" servlet. Upon logging in, it will greet the user ""Hello, !"" with a simple function or . Based on the examples found here, I modified my Web.xml details as below: Under my login.jsp, I have a simple form that does the logging in. Under my index.jsp, it greets the users with a simple request. I am facing three issues here. Importance ranked as it is. 1) Error 403 The redirecting and logging in page works. When I try to access index.jsp, I am redirected to login.jsp. When I enter an incorrect uid:pwd pair, I am greeted with error.jsp. When I log in correctly, I am redirected back to index.jsp but I am greeted with an Error 403: The Website requires you to log in. I am sure I have logged in because I am previously unable to access the built-in snoop page, but after logging in, I can.

The codes as shown in the index.jsp should be correct as I copied it out from snoop sample codes found on the internet. request.getRemoteUser() does not work on my index.jsp but works on the snoop page. There must be something I am not calling before performing the request? 3) Security (not important, yet) I think this j_security_check is under Spring Security. I am trying to encrypt both the sending and the receiving side as well as the transport channel. This is because for authentication, I believe the password must not be sent or stored in clear text.

In the below query, you can see that I retrieve from user_profile table some attribute value ids, the education is one attribute for example. When I have value id for attribute education, I retrieve label name for this id from array (php code) where id is array key. Similar is with about 10 other attributes. Otherwise my query would be even more complex, I would need to create table attribute_id_label and make for each attribute another join to retrieve label name for value id of each attribute. This means extra 10 joins which could slow query. But still this would be the correct way. So my question is: If table attribute_id_label have only about 500 records. Will 10 joins with this table make any big difference since the table is very small? Even if the table user_profile is very big and the query is already quite complex as you see? And here is my query: Most attributes won't be filled by user and since you advise non-NULLable, what would be the best to use for those unfilled attributes? I can use for each attribute extra field No answer. Each attribute would have extra value No answer. Let's give attributes education and want for example. Attribute education have id 1, want is 2.

Currently, my objects are represented in this way: The goal is that I should be able to pass everything around as a and then discover the type of the object by comparing the attribute. For example, to cast an integer for use I would simply do the following (assume that is of type ): The problem is that, as far as I know, the C standard makes no promises about how structures are stored. On my platform this works. But on another platform might store before and when I accessed in the above I would actually be accessing , which is obviously bad. Portability is a big goal here. There are alternatives to this approach: The problem here is that the union uses up as much space as the size of the largest thing that can be stored in the union. Given that some of my types are many times as large as my other types, this would mean that my small types () would take up as much space as my large types () which is an unacceptable tradeoff. This creates a level of redirection that will slow things down. Speed is a goal here. The final alternative is to pass around s and manage the internals of the structure myself. For example, to implement the type test mentioned above: This gives me everything I want (portability, different sizes for different types, etc.) but has at least two downsides: Hideous, error-prone C. The code above only calculates a single-member offset; it will get much worse with types more complex than integers. I might be able to alleviate this a bit using macros, but this will be painful no matter what. Since there is no that represents the object, I don't have the option of stack allocations (at least without implementing my own stack on the heap). Basically, my question is, how can I get what I want without paying for it? Is there a way to be portable, have variance in size for different types, not use redirection, and keep my code pretty?

909365,PHP Web Design: Using Smarty vs Rest feeds with jQuery,"I've been trawling SO for a couple of hours tonight looking for some answers, but I've not found anything that really answers what I'm after. My apologies if it has, in fact, been answered already. I'm designing a new website and I'm trying to decide on the architecture to use to serve the content. In the past, my websites have used PHP feeding data into Smarty templates. However, recently at my work, I've been working on a Java web application where jQuery was used to retrieve the data from a RESTful API (which returned JSON), where HTML template pages were used as the base and javascript was used (utilising jQuery) to fill in the content. My question: The website I'm designing will be in PHP, but would it be better to construct (or use an existing) RESTful API or to continue on as I've done before feeding the data into Smarty templates? Are there real benefits to one or the other, or does it just come down to developer preference/experience? If it helps, the website will be for a church, where the content types will be CMS-like; news/announcements, wiki-like pages, and a limited type of social networking (for the minister to communicate with parishioners).",[],False

It seems like the approach should involve getting this as the error term of the Taylor expansion of a function that we know something about? I'm having trouble making much more progress than that. Updated Progress: From the definition of the error term of the Taylor expansion we have: $$E_n (x) = \frac{1}{n!} \int_a^x (x-t)^n f^{(n+1)} (t) dt$$ Alternatively, we may express this in the Lagrange form of the error term (derived from the weighted mean value theorem of integrals): $$E_n (x) = \frac{f^{(n+1)}(c)}{(n+1)!} (x-a)^{n+1} \qquad \text{where } a &lt; c &lt; x.$$ Now, let $a = 0$, $x = 1$, $n = 30$, $f^{(n+1)}(t) = \dfrac{1+t^{30}}{(1+t^{60})(1-t)^{30}}$, and set the two alternative expressions of $E_n(x)$ equal to each other: $$\begin{align*} \implies &amp; \frac{1}{n!} \int_a^x (x-t)^n f^{(n+1)}(t) dt &amp; = &amp; \dfrac{f^{(n+1)}(c)}{(n+1)!} (x-a)^{n+1}\\ \implies &amp; \frac{1}{30!} \int_0^1 (1-t)^{30} \dfrac{1+t^{30}}{(1+t^{60})(1-t)^{30}} &amp; = &amp; \dfrac{1}{31!} \dfrac{1+c^{30}}{(1+c^{60})(1-c)^{30}}\\ \implies &amp; \int_0^1 \dfrac{1+t^{30}}{1+t^{60}} &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{31} \frac{1+c^{30}}{(1+c^{60})(1-c)^{30}}. \end{align*} $$ I cannot seem to get from here to $=1 + \dfrac{c}{31}$.

989098,"Need Oracle query for a BOM IMPLOSION or BOM ""WHERE-USED"" on Oracle 10g","Working with Oracle DB 10g. I am tasked with writing an Oracle query for a BOM IMPLOSION commonly known as BOM ""WHERE-USED."" Essentially, given an item or part, I need to provide a list of parent items that contain that item or part, if any. I have recently coded a BOM EXPLOSION using the following SQL which utilizes the START WITH and CONNECT BY syntax to create a heirarchy downward from a parent item. I found inspiration for the BOM EXPLOSION query at http://www.confluentminds.com/Trainings/SCM/Topic1.1_Ch1_Part5.html Current BOM EXPLOSION code: Now, I need go from any child item and list all parent items that contain that child item. I have searched for ""oracle bom implosion"" and ""oracle bom where used"" but nothing is obvious to me. The BOM IMPLOSION seems far less straightforward than the BOM EXPLOSION. Any help or advice is greatly appreciated. Clint Van Zee EDIT 02-NOV-2011: Yes, I want to traverse up a BOM heirarchy and list those items or components where a specified component is used in the bill. Based on your answer, I looked into the ""connect by"" relationship and ""start with."" I think I have a way to do this. I may have been close to the answer without knowing it. Craig, here is your mock-up with modifications added to prove this out. I also modified the ""connect by"" and ""start with."" It {should!} start with the child component and go ""upwards"" to list those models or components that ""use"" the specified starting component. To do this, I also removed the ""prior"" keyword. This produces the following result: Looking at the mock data, component 5 is ""used by"" component2, component4, and topmodel2. So, this change seems to do what I intend.

1006739,HBase scan with compare filters has long delay when returning last row,"I have HBase running in standalone mode and encountered some problems when I query the tables using the Java API. The table has several million entries (but might grow to billions) which have the following row key metric : I use two compare-operation filters to query a specific row range which represents a time interval. When I call the ResultScanner#next() method everything works fine until it gets to the last row of the key range which is specified through the filters. It takes up to 40 seconds until the ResultScanner returns the last row, which is lexically smaller than the upper row range limit. When I change the order of the filters in the filterList from to it takes the scanner up to 40 seconds until it starts to return any results but there is no more delay on returning the last row, so I figured that the delay comes from the CompareOp.LESS - filter. The only way I know of to get around this delay is to omit the upperRowFilter and check manually if the row keys are out of range but I am sure there has to be something wrong, because I found nothing on that problem searching the internet. I also already tried to get rid of that with caching, but when I use a cache size which is less than the number of rows returned it doesn't change anything and if I use a cache size bigger than the number of rows returned the delay is still there but again before any results are returned.

The problem is, the webbrowser control captures the drag gesture and it is impossible to scroll the listbox once the webbrowser control is expanded. If the content of the webbrowser is too long, the user is stuck and cannot scroll anymore as the webbrowser fill the entire screen. Now, the webbrowser only needs to respond to simple tap events (buttons). The webbrowser control captures all touch gestures and events internally, but it seems that there is a element where touch events can be intercepted before the touch gestures reach the and is gone forever: Border border = WebViewer.Descendants&lt;Border&gt;().Last() as Border; To capture the touch gesture, I added a ManipulationDelta event to the border as it does not allow me to add a Gesture Listener event like , , . Now I need to get this ManipulationDelta event data to the scrollviewer inside the listbox where the browser is located. Is this a valid conceptual approach and is somebody able to help me on how to get this running? P.S.: I tried it the other way around (sending tap gesture events from a canvas overlay to a javascript inside the webbrowser control page and simulate a tap on the page) but this does not seem to work very well as the touch coordinates and the javascript coordinates have a unknown offset.

1106255,How to expose view-model properties as externally bindable dependency properties?,"I'm writing a WPF user control which internally uses MVVM. In order to work out-of-the-box, it creates its own view-model (this part is not relevant to the question). My control exposes a number of dependency properties. The host view (whoever uses my control) can set these DPs or bind to them. Some of these DPs have corresponding view-model properties. This is what I want to achieve (see diagram): the DPs in my control's view are bound to the corresponding properties of the view-model. Additionally, the host view needs to be able to set or bind these DPs, too - the same way you use any other control. However, as soon as the host view sets or binds the DP's value, the original binding (binding it internally to the control's view-model) is lost. This is because every DP can only have a single binding set. So this doesn't work: One solution is to make the view-model a DependencyObject and its properties DPs. This way, I could bind the control's view-model to its view rather than the other way around, effectively reversing the left arrow. However, for various reasons, I want my view-model to use plain C# properties and INotifyPropertyChanged. Any ideas on how to expose view-model properties as externally bindable dependency properties? Edit: To clarify on the requirements: the view does not in fact create the view-model itself (I realize that would violate the separation of concerns); rather, it uses a view-model locator to do so. (It's a terribly modular enterprise application.) I know this is not a typical approach (see Rachel's answer). However, accepting the described set-up, is there any way to achieve the desired result?",[],False

To avoid a misunderstanding: I'm not talking about finding a supplied pattern in multiple locations. Repeating patterns can also be understood to mean repeating images. The definition of pattern here isn't abstract. Imagine, for instance, a brick wall. The wall is composed of individual bricks. A picture of the wall is composed of the repeating image of a brick. The solution must preferably find the largest repeating pattern. Large in this context can be defined two ways: pixel area or number of repetitions. In the above example, you can cut the bricks in half. In order to make a brick, you can rotate a segment and attach the halves. While the complete brick is the largest repeating image in terms of pixel area, there are 2x more repetitions of half blocks. Any thoughts?",[],False

Under ZFC, there is a Lebesgue-nonmeasurable set, and under ZF, it is consistent that every subset of the reals is Lebesgue-measurable. There is no definable Lebesgue-nonmeasurable set. How does one formalize or prove this relationship, either in general or for particular cases such as these? It makes some intuitive sense to me that the sets described in the axioms of ZF can all be described via comprehensions (i.e. $\bigcup X=\{x|\exists y\in X:x\in y\}$, $\{a,b\}=\{x|x=a\vee x=b\}$, $f(X)=\{x|\exists y\in X:x=f(y)\}$, and so on), while the choice function described in AC is inherently not definable given only its domain, so facts which are provably dependent on AC must also inherit this nonconstructive nature, but I have no idea how to prove any of that.",[],False

For example, the date ""Wed Mar 04 05:09:06 GMT-06:00 2009"" is properly parsed with python-dateutil: but the following Joda time call doesn't work: And creating your own DateTimeFormatter defeats the purpose, since that seems to be the same as using SimpleDateFormatter with the correct format string. Is there a comparable way to parse a date in Java, like python-dateutil? I don't care about errors, I just want it to mostly perfect.","[""import dateutil.parser\nprint dateutil.parser.parse('Wed Mar 04 05:09:06 GMT-06:00 2009')\n"", '    String date = ""Wed Mar 04 05:09:06 GMT-06:00 2009"";\n    DateTimeFormatter fmt = ISODateTimeFormat.dateTime();\n    DateTime dt = fmt.parseDateTime(date);\n    System.out.println(date);\n']",False

Prove that every triangular region is measurable and its area is one half the product of its base and altitude.

If the rectangle has length $h$ and breadth $k$ then $a(R) = hk$. 6) Let $Q$ be a set enclosed between two step regions $S$ and $T$ so that $S \subseteq Q \subseteq T$. If there is a unique number $c$ such that $a(S) \leq c \leq a(T)$ for all such step regions $S$ and $T$, then $a(Q) = c$.

I want to express $\Delta f$ in terms of derivatives of $\varphi$. I first looked at the partial derivatives of $f$: $$\partial_i f = \frac{x_i}{\|x\|} \cdot \varphi &#39; (\|x\|)$$ $$\partial_i^2 f = \left ( \frac{1}{\|x\|} - \frac{x_i^2}{\|x\|^3} \right ) \cdot \varphi &#39; (\|x\|) + \frac{x_i^2}{\|x\|^2} \cdot \varphi &#39;&#39; (\|x\|)$$ That's what I get applying chain- and product rule. So: $$\Delta f = \sum_{i=1}^n \partial_i^2 f$$ but this is still a very ugly sum. I tried to simplify it as far as possible and if I didn't make any mistake, I ended up with: $$\Delta f = \frac{1}{\|x\|^2} \cdot \left ( \varphi &#39; \cdot \left ( \sum \left ( \frac{\|x\|}{x_i^2} \right ) - \frac{1}{\|x\|} \right ) + \varphi &#39;&#39; \right )$$ And I think I can rewrite the sum with something like: $$n \cdot \|x\| \cdot (x_1^2 x_2^2 ... x_n^2)^{n-2}$$ But this doesn't look any better. I know that I have to arrive at something similar to: $$\Delta f = \varphi &#39;&#39; (\|x\|) + \frac{n-1}{\|x\|} \cdot \varphi &#39; (\|x\|)$$ Does anyone have an idea how I could further simplify my term or where I went wrong, or whether there is an easier way to simplify the first sum such that I arrive at the wished result?

1374388,Streaming data for state machine playback,"I have a state machine design that needs to support playback. We have states that perform actions and sometimes need to generate random numbers. In case the program shuts down while in the middle of the FSM's execution, the program needs to playback the whole FSM using the same random numbers as before. For a basic example, let's say I had three states: A, B, and C. The FSM will call a state's Execute() function. At the end of the function, the state will post an event, and the FSM will determine which state to go to next. In state A, it will call rand(). If the number is even, it will post an event to go to state B, otherwise state C should be the next state. If the random number is 69, then it should go to state C. While in state C, it's possible that the program might quit. When the program starts up again, it should playback the state machine. Obviously, for this to work correctly, it can't generate a completely new random number, it needs to use 69 again for accurate playback. I have a file stream interface that I can use for saving data to a file, but the code is a little ugly: My only problem with this solution is that I don't care for having to check the stream for data first and then conditionally write to the same stream. I thought about hiding it like this: Inside IStream, operator&amp; (probably not the best use of overloading) would actually try to read an int from the stream. If that stream was empty, it would then write it instead. Like before, the behavior would be: read first until the end of stream, and then start appending. So I guess my question is: is there a common idiom for this type of playback that I might be overlooking? Does anyone have alternate suggestions? I feel like I'm starting to over-complicate the design a bit.

1486163,C Programming - Class project,"http://pastebin.com/uws2Ts96 - my program so far I'm attempting to write a C program for my class where the program will display a menu giving 3 options, option 1 will lead to the function named ExtractLargestDigit, and option 2 will lead to DigitOccurrence, and option 3 will end the program. The problem I'm having is that i want to make it so if the user enters any value other than 1 2 or 3 the program will print out WRONG OPTION and reprint out the menu and ask for another option. I thought the way I was going about it was correct but every time I run the program it crashes. I believe there's a problem with my while loop. I also am having problems with the 2 functions: For the first function I want to have the user enter in a number, for example 123456, and have the program go through each digit of the number and print out the largest digit, and at what position did it occur in the number. For example in this number (123456) the largest digit is 6 and it is in the ones digit position. For the second function I want the user to enter in 2 numbers (123423) and (452313) and have the program break the numbers down into their digits, assign them to an array, count the number of times each digit occurs and print out a list from 1-0 with the number of times the number occur along side it. Any thoughts on these problems would be greatly appreciated.",[],False

1487659,JTable with a complex editor,"I have many custom editors for a JTable and it's an understatement to say that the usability, particularly in regard to editing with the keyboard, is lacking. The main reason for this is that my editors are always created with a similar (though often more complex) situation to this: I.E a panel with more than one component inside. The actual text editor is a descendant of the component being returned as the editor. So, rendering issues aside, from what I can tell, the JTable is focusing the component that is returned by the method so when you press a key with a cell highlighted it passes focus and the key press to the panel, thinking that's the editor. Is there anyway I can inform JTable that the ""real"" editor is the JTextfield? Adding a hacky on the correct component is insufficient as the key press won't get passed on.","['@Override\npublic Component getTableCellEditorComponent(JTable table, Object value, boolean isSelected, int row, int column) {\n  JPanel container = new JPanel();\n  container.setLayout(new BorderLayout());\n  container.add(field, BorderLayout.CENTER);\n  field.setText((String) value);\n  container.add(new JButton(""...""), BorderLayout.EAST);\n  return container;\n}\n', 'getTableCellEditorComponent', 'requestFocusInWindow']",False

AFAIK, Subsonic doesn't support FullText, so I ended up creating a simple UDF function (Table Function) which takes 2 params (keywords to search and max number of results). Now, how can I inner join the main table with this FreeTextTable? InlineQuery is not an option. Example: table ARTICLE with fields Id, ArticleName, Author, ArticleStatus. The search can be done by one of more of the following fields: ArticleName (fulltext), Author (another FullText but with different search keywords), ArticleStatus (an int). Actually the query is far more complex and has other joins (depending on user choice). If SubSonic cannot handle this situation, probably the best solution is good old plain sql (so there would be no need to create an UDF, too).

1587353,updating and creating from different places in ruby on rail 3,"I bet others have had this problem, but I have not seen a good solution. In a rails app you might want to do stuff with one model from different places. Say, you have a Projects page where you list all the projects and have a form for making new ones. This form also serves as a update form if the (:id) is present. Lets say you also have a customers show page where you also list all the projects for a spesific customer. Here you also want to edit and create projects( for this customer) When the controller gets this it will send the user to the page spesified in the respond_to block. But, sometimes you want to go back to the projects page and other times you want the customer show page. When submiting with ajax. For the projects page you fill it with javascript and ERB, that does not necessarry fit the customers show page. Is there an elegant way to handle this without a ton of if statements? Edit I have been experimenting a bit on a testapp with two scaffolds projecs and todos. I don't think this is elegant. To many if statements and not very DRY.

1640199,What is the best Scheme implementation for (sys-admin) shell scripts?,"I've gone through the academic Scheme stuff (read SICP, The Little Schemer, The Seasoned Schemer, TSPL) and been playing with Scheme as a toy for a while. But I want to get practical. Today I needed to write a shell script to do some batch file processing, and thought ""why not do it in Scheme?"". I did, and it was a joy. Now I'm forced to wonder what the best implementation is for shell script type stuff. I know all implementations differ in terms of what they implement beyond R5RS. (Basically, they differ in all the useful and practical extensions you'd want in a scripting language). So I'd like to pick one implementation and stick to it. I'm looking for something that: Is cross platform (Linux, OS X, Windows). Has extensions that are useful in day-to-day shell scripting, and those extensions are part of the base install. Is easy to install. (e.g. there are a number of pre-built binaries, and/or it is a standard package on many distros.) Is actively developed, with an active community. Has Unicode support. I've been using Gambit so far. It seems to satisfy the above constraints. PLT seems like overkill. Wondering about Guile, MIT/GNU, etc.",[],False
1642941,PHP script or API for filtering inappropriate content,"I run a website where aspiring writers post their writing. Naturally, some of this writing can be of a 'sensitive' nature. Sometimes it contains a lot of swear words, sometimes it's malicious, sometimes it's suicidal. It's not the norm, but it exists. Of course, we want our users to feel free to post what content they like, but the issue arises with advertisers. Namely, Google Adsense, which routinely sends us warnings about a piece of content that contains too much swearing or is defamatory. The latest is a piece someone wrote about cutting themselves which Google has deemed too 'tragic'. I've generally been able to write scripts too look through the text and detect a lot of swear words or racist terms or anti-gay rhetoric, etc. But I can't for the live of me figure out how to detect 'tragic' text. So, the question is 2 fold. Is there some sort of PHP class/function/API that is good at detecting inappropriate content? Any idea on how to automatically detect suicidal or self-harming content?",[],False
1645296,Rotating body from spherical coordinates,"Is it possible to rotate body which has its vertices defined in spherical coordinates. Currently I am doing collage project in VHDL and is about rotating dodecahedron and presenting over VGA. I applied pinhole camera model equations and that required just two sin/cos calculation and two multiplication per vertice. I was just thinking about rotating around 3rd axis using 3 steps over two angles but i am unable to figure out proper equations and even if this is possible. Edit I think I got it. Rotating over 3rd axis which is in same direction as camera is just 2D transform of camera coordinates once you you compute them. That mean than for rotating in 3 axes (ok two axis and one inclination) you need to apply total of 4 sin/cos computations and 4 multiplications.

1658291,Android WebView not loading second page from cache,"I have an Android app that simply houses a website. I would like the app to cache the pages of the website for offline use. I'm doing a simple test to see if the cache is working but unfortunately it is failing to load a page i have previously loaded in online mode, when offline. To make things clearer i load the following 2 pages when in online mode. . I am hoping that the ""why-bmi.php"" page is loaded into the cache as well as the subsequent page http://www.bmimobile.co.uk/. The latter page has a link on it which refers to the first page. If i then come out of the app and turn the network adapter off then go back into the app the ""http://www.bmimobile.co.uk/"" page DOES display but when i click the ""why-bmi"" link that page DOES NOT display. I short toast message displays saying ""error loading page"". Can anyone tell me why the webview is not caching loaded page for later offline use? Here's the main activity and i've extended the Application object defining the appcachepath. Thanks in advance Matt . .This is the logging when the app is first loaded in online mode . This is the logging when i've come out of the app turned off the network adapter then gone back into app in offline mode. [edit1] Actually on closer inspection of the logging, it seems to have changed when loaded in online mode. below is the logcat in omline mode. There seems to be a problem with the cache storage. . [notes] if i click on the why-bmi button when in online mode then come out of the app, turn the adapter off then click the why-bmi button again then it shows the ""error loading page"" message. If i however change to the following urls, my SO page is displayed. If i click the link to my bounty page(this page), then go offline, the SO page is display as you would expect but if you click the bounty link in offline mode then it DOES display. so there are differences between the SO site and the bmi site.

1696261,Fluent NHibernate Many-to-many mapping with auto-generated pk instead of composite key,"I'm working on a RoleProvider in .NET, using Fluent NHibernate to map tables in an Oracle 9.2 database. The problem is that the many-to-many table connecting users and roles uses a primary key generated from a sequence, as opposed to a composite key. I can't really change this, because I'm writing it to be implemented in a larger existing system. Here is my UserMap: And my RoleMap: Yet, this is giving me the error: Type 'FluentNHibernate.Cfg.FluentConfigurationException' in assembly 'FluentNHibernate, Version=1.0.0.593, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=8aa435e3cb308880' is not marked as serializable. Is there a simple fix to allow this HasMayToMany to use my PersistentObjectMap extension? I'm thinking I may have to add a convention for this many-to-many relationship, but I don't know where to start with that, since I've just started using NHibernate and Fluent NHibernate only recently. I've been working on this problem for a while and I can't seem to find a solution. Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks. EDIT: I think I've found a possible solution here: http://marekblotny.blogspot.com/2009/02/fluent-nhbernate-and-collections.html I'll try the above method of creating an entity and a class map for the linking table and post my findings. EDIT 2: I created a linking entity as mentioned in the above blog post and downloaded the newest binaries (1.0.0.623). This helped me discover that the issue was with setting lazy load and trying to add roles to the user object in a completely new session. I modified the code to move OpenSession to the BeginRequest of an HttpModule as described here. After doing this, I changed my data access code from wrapping the open session in a using statement, which closes the session when it is finished, to getting the current session and wrapping only the transaction in a using statement. This seems to have resolved the bulk of my issue, but I am now getting an error that says ""Could not insert collection"" into the USR_ROLE table. And I'm wondering if the above code should work with a UserRoleMap described as: Hibernate's documentation for many-to-many relationship suggests creating an object to maintain a one-to-many/many-to-one, as in an ERD. I'm sure this would be much easier with conventional naming standards, but I have to stick with certain abbreviations and odd (and not always properly-implemented) conventions.","['        public UserMap()\n        {\n            this.Table(""USR"");\n            HasMany(x =&gt; x.Memberships).Cascade.All()\n                .Table(""MEMBERSHIP"").Inverse().LazyLoad();\n            HasManyToMany(x =&gt; x.Roles)\n                .Table(""USR_ROLE"")\n                .Cascade.SaveUpdate()\n                .ParentKeyColumn(""USR_ID"")\n                .ChildKeyColumn(""ROLE_ID"")\n                .Not.LazyLoad();\n        }\n', '    public RoleMap()\n    {\n        this.Table(""ROLE"");            \n        Map(x =&gt; x.Description).Column(""ROLE_NAME"");\n        Map(x =&gt; x.Comment).Column(""ROLE_COMMENT"");\n        HasManyToMany(x =&gt; x.Users)\n            .Table(""USR_ROLE"")\n            .ParentKeyColumn(""ROLE_ID"")\n            .ChildKeyColumn(""USR_ID"")\n            .Inverse();\n    }\n', '    public UserRoleMap()\n    {\n        this.Table(""USR_ROLE""); \n\n        /* maps audit fields id, created date/user, updated date/user */\n        this.PersistentObjectMap(""USR_ROLE""); \n\n        /* Link these tables */\n        References(x =&gt; x.Role).Column(""ROLE_ID"");\n        References(x =&gt; x.User).Column(""USR_ID"");\n    }\n']",False

The page tries to send to itself, then is suppose to check if the method was post and various validation checks, the usual stuff. But then, the http response is a 404 not found page.

Clearly the web server did not even try to execute index.php, but decided based on the request headers somehow that the response should be a 404. Now I've done my own debugging, and played with the article I'm sending. I tried to append the article paragraph by paragraph and see on what paragraph the bug triggers. The form submits fine until a certain paragraph, at that point I said Bingo! I thought I isolated the problem and tried to submit the form using that paragraph alone, but then the form submitted.

1738370,creating many to many relationship between documents in different lotus notes databases,"I am doing ""traditional"" lotus notes programming (same since R5) and need to implement linking between 2 document types (forms) residing in different databases. Document of type (A) in database (A) can reference several documents of type (B) in database (B). And document (B) should also display its relationships with document (A), as document (B) can be related to different documents (A). We have Many to Many relationship. At the moment it is implemented on one side only (one to many): Form of Document (A) contains embedded view of special ""link"" documents residing in database A. This link documents are created by lotusScript when user selects documents from database (B). When user clicks on an item in this embedded view, it opens document (B). Client wants to be able to edit this relationship on any side, so that if he edits it in form (A), form (B) is updated. Form (B) is supposed to have the same kind of embedded view or a list of associated documents of type (A) What is the best way to implement it? Client's infrastracture is Lotus Domino 8.5.2 + Lotus Notes 8.5.2, so theoretically, composite applications approach may be an option. The reason why I ask this question is that as far as I understand there is no good way in Notes to embed a view from another database. The requirement is that the database should be present on workspace to be displayed in some sort of dodgy list. It would be great to be able to specify target database for embedded view by server and replicaID, but instead we have a weird list of random workspace databases.",[],False

1886164,Proving a family of orthogonal functions is complete over a certain interval,"I'm reading Applied Partial Differential Equations by DuChateu and Zachmann, and the first couple of chapters contain quite a bit of review of Fourier series, as well as theory about L2 integrable functions and orthogonal/orthonormal basis sets of functions. Some of the exercises require showing that a particular family of functions is not a complete orthogonal or orthonormal family over a certain interval. The definition given by the book which I am able to remember is that a family of functions is not complete in L2 if $\exists$ a non-zero function $g \in L^2: (g, u_k) = 0$, $\{u_k: k = 1, 2,\ldots\}$ The full definition of a complete family of functions is here. There don't appear to be any exercises on how to prove a family of functions is complete; it would seem this is a more difficult task. For example, the family of functions $(\frac{2}{\pi})^{\frac{1}{2}}\sin(kx)$ is stated to be complete and orthonormal on the interval $L^2(0, \pi)$; IIRC the family of function $\sin(\frac{n\pi x}{L})$ is complete and orthogonal (but not orthonormal) on the interval $(0, L)$. I don't think the definition in 2 would be much help, certainly one can't evaluate every possible piecewise continuous function on the interval in question? The (perhaps simpleminded) approach I had in mind (assuming the converse of the the above definition of a function not being complete is true) would be to go from there with a proof by contradiction, or else somehow show that if there is some function g that purports to make the inner product $(g, u_k)$ zero on the interval, that this function by necessity would have to converge to $u_j, j \neq k$ at all points on the interval to make the inner product integral go to zero. I haven't gotten very far in my attempts, though, and any further advice on how to go about this would be appreciated.",[],False

1994296,TFS and Subversion,"I have the following goals: Shared source control with continuous integration The ability to check in incremental changes that may or may not build (i.e., breaking changes) without affecting other team members The ability, without days of work, to get a report of the incremental changes checked in (not a report of the FACT that a check in was made, but an actual diff report - late edit: I now know this to be a ""unified diff"") One possible solution is to use TFS as the primary source control with continuous integration and then use personal subversion implementations on top of that for tracking and checking in incremental changes that could break the build. I understand TFS has the shelve option, but I don't think TFS has a nice summary report of check-in diffs (see below), nor is there a way that I know of to easily see a diff for a shelveset. So, the questions are: Does anyone know how to get an SVN report of check-ins with something like this for each file (or, for that matter, how to get something like this out of TFS): Does anyone have experience with overlapping source control? And finally, does anyone know how these goals could be accomplished using only TFS or only SVN (or something else)?

2031103,"Could someone explain gtk2hs drag and drop to me, the listDND.hs demo just isn't doing it for me?","As the title says, I just don't get DND (or rather I understand the concept and I understand the order of callbacks, I just don't understand how to setup DND for actual usage.) I'd like to say that I've done DND stuff before in C, but considering I never really got that working... So I'm trying (and mostly succeeding, save DND) to write a text editor (using gtksourceview, because it has built in code highlighting.) Reasons are below if you want them. Anyways, there's not really a good DND demo or tutorial available for gtk2hs (listDND.hs just doesn't translate well in my head.) So what I'm asking is for code that demonstrates simple DND on a window widget (for example.) Ideally, it should accept drops from other windows (such as Thunar) and print out the information in string form. I think I can take it from there... Reasons: I'm running a fairly light weight setup, dwm and a few gtk+2 programs. I really don't want to have to pull in gtk+3 to get the current gedit from the repos (Arch Linux.) Currently, I'm using geany for all of my text editing needs, however, geany is a bit heavy for editing config files. Further, geany doesn't care for my terminal of choice (st;) so I don't even get the benefit of using it as an IDE. Meaning I'd like a lightweight text editor with syntax highlighting. I could configure emacs or vim or something, but that seems to me to be more of a hack then a proper solution. Thus my project was born. It's mostly working (aside from DND, all that's left is proper multi-tab support.) Admittedly, I could probably work this out if I wrote it in C, but there isn't that much state in a text editor so Haskell's been working fine with almost no need for mutable variables.",[],False

The Server/clients will be deployed over a LAN (potentially WAN, but definitely customer-managed, not centralized server). I'm considering these two options: Client and Server can be different versions. This way, the WCF interface between them has to support versioning - if one has been updated and not the other, app still needs to work. Server pushes updates to client, client auto-installs update before communicating. No versioning required, as the server won't communicate with an out-of-date client. The client is a Window service that's running as LocalSystem, so there are no permissions concerns with an auto-update. #2 seems cleaner, as there's no interface versioning to keep track of, but I'm afraid I'm missing a really obvious reason to not do this in favor of #1.

Note this happens infrequently and is not something that can be reproduced easily or each time a specific url is accessed. I have seen various answers posted both here on SO and on google but there does not seem to be any definitive reason as to why this error occurs. Maybe this is because the error is fairly generic but the most common answer seems to be due to circular import errors. Another answer I've seen is that model FK field references have not been the correct case (e.g. applabel.model instead of applabel.Model) but all my model FK fields are correct. The cause of the error seems to point to one of my admin.py files. This file did originally import custom form classes from a forms.py file. Both the admin.py file and forms.py file imported the same models from a models.py file. Therefore I moved the form classes to the admin.py file in case there was a circular reference occurring here but I still occasionally get these errors. Could anyone shed any light as to why this error occurs and why so randomly? I always ensure the relevant services are restarted after a code update.

2131320,How to pass a pointer to a dynamic array to a void function?,"Updated question to reflect answers and my research Thanks casablanca and wallyk for answering. Success!! I ended up having to edit my strcpy and strcat as well as changing my Displayname(char c_fullname) function and researching some more about the additional errors (both complier and runtime) I was getting, but now I have working code!! Thanks to everyone for your help and patience. My final problem was that I was supposed to write my function declaration and implementation (but not my function call) as ""Displayname(char* c_fullname)"" not ""Displayname(char *c_fullname)"". Simple mistake but definitely a costly one as my program was not passing the strings completely. Again thanks to everyne for their help. I know I would have gotten this far without it. I am posting my completed working code below for anyone else who may have the same issue: Hey everyone, Thanks for your previous help. I have another assignment (past due) that is giving me problems. I think the assignment is to pass a pointer of a dynamic array to a function which then will display the strings. My instructions is to "" pass the constructed array to a function called void DisplayName(char * Name)"" However, I keep getting errors. My code is: my error is: error C2664: 'DisplayName' : cannot convert parameter 1 from 'char' to 'char *' I have tried to change several parts to make it work, all of which give me other errors. At this point I am really stuck, so looking for some advice.

2143807,WPF Combobox not updating ViewModel,"I have a really weird issue with Combobox in WPF. I have used it before in a simpler implementation and thought I knew how it works, but apparently not. The scenario is as follows... I have three classes which are in a parent/child relationship, I have a list of a type AnswerViewModel which I populate in a Combobox. I want the IsSelected property on the class to be the value that is get/set in the Combobox. Below is some of the code, hopefully enough to see what I am referring to. These are the models. These are the ViewModels QuizViewModel.cs QuestionViewModel.cs AnswerViewModel.cs These are the XAMLs Quiz.xaml Question.xaml The Combobox is populated correctly (It is bound to the Collection of AnswerViewModel), but when I make a selection what I expect is to see at the breakpoint is two events. One for the false on the item no longer selected, and true for the new item selected. But instead it never gets hit. So I scour the web looking for help and found some interesting information and tried a number of things but, so far nothing seems to be complete. For example: But this only selects the correct item in the Combobox when drop-down. Which I understand is correct for this markup. So, in short, I would like to have the IsSelected Property on the AnswerViewModel updated when I select an item in the Combobox. Any help would be greatly appreciated. If more information is required just let me know. Thank you, Obscured ** Update ** Ok, I think I actually resolved it, but still If anyone has suggestions, or thoughts on this, I would still like to hear them. Here is what I did, I only changed the Combobox xaml as follows: Basically this sets the selectedvalue to the current item, and since the itemcontainerstyle handles the case when drop-down it binds the IsSelected property of the combobox to the IsSelected property of my ViewModel. And this appears to do the trick.","['public class Quiz\n{\n    public string QuizName {get;set;}\n    public List&lt;Question&gt; Questions {get;set;}\n}\n\npublic class Question\n{\n    public int QuestionId {get;set;}\n    public string QuestionText {get;set;}\n    public List&lt;Answer&gt; {get;set;}\n}\n\npublic class Answer\n{\n    public int AnswerId {get;set;}\n    public string AnswerText {get;set;}\n    public bool IsSelected {get;set;}\n}\n', '// This will create QuestionViewModel for each question.\nObservableCollection&lt;QuestionViewModel&gt; Questions {get;set;}\n', '// This will create AnswerViewModel for each answer\nObservableCollection&lt;AnswerViewModel&gt; Answers {get;set;}\n', 'Answer answer;\n\n// ctor\npublic AnswerViewModel(Answer answer...)\n{\n    this.answer = answer;\n    ...\n}\n\npublic string AnswerText \n{\n    get { return answer.AnswerText; }\n    set\n    {\n        answer.AnswerText = value;\n        NotifyPropertyChanged(""AnswerText"");\n    }\n}\n\npublic bool IsSelected \n{ \n    get { return _answer.IsSelected; }\n    set \n    {\n        answer.IsSelected = value;\n        NotifyPropertyChanged(""IsSelected""); // &lt;--- Breakpoint\n    }\n}              \n', '&lt;ItemsControl ItemsSource=""{Binding Questions}"" /&gt;\n', '&lt;ComboBox x:Name=""answerCombo""\n    ItemsSource=""{Binding Answers}""\n    DisplayMemberPath=""AnswerText""\n    SelectedValue=""{Binding Path=IsSelected}"" \n    SelectedValuePath=""IsSelected""/&gt;\n', '&lt;ComboBox x:Name=""answerCombo""\n    ItemsSource=""{Binding Answers}""\n    DisplayMemberPath=""AnswerText""\n    SelectedValue=""{Binding Path=IsSelected}""\n    SelectedValuePath=""IsSelected""&gt;\n    &lt;ComboBox.ItemContainerStyle&gt;\n        &lt;Style TargetType=""{x:Type ComboBoxItem}""&gt;\n            &lt;Setter Property=""IsSelected"" Value=""{Binding Path=IsSelected, Mode=TwoWay}""/&gt;\n        &lt;/Style&gt;\n    &lt;/ComboBox.ItemContainerStyle&gt;\n&lt;/Combobox&gt;\n', '&lt;ComboBox x:Name=""answerCombo""\n    ItemsSource=""{Binding Answers}""\n    DisplayMemberPath=""AnswerText""\n    SelectedValue=""{Binding Path=ItemsSource/, RelativeSource={RelativeSource Self}}""&gt;        \n    &lt;ComboBox.ItemContainerStyle&gt;\n        &lt;Style TargetType=""{x:Type ComboBoxItem}""&gt;\n            &lt;Setter Property=""IsSelected"" Value=""{Binding Path=IsSelected, Mode=TwoWay}""/&gt;\n        &lt;/Style&gt;\n    &lt;/ComboBox.ItemContainerStyle&gt;\n&lt;/Combobox&gt;\n']",False

When I refresh the page the list is always in the correct order and the updates have been made in the db.

2400344,C# - EasyHook CoCreateInstance,"I'm working the open source library EasyHook. What I'm trying to do, is hook into when a VB6 app calls CoCreateInstance from ole32.dll on a particular CLSID, return my own C# implementation for the object rather than the true COM object. My C# implementation derives from the same interface that tlbimp.exe spits out for the COM object I want to replace. My hook works, and I'm able to hook into calls, log data about the call, and then p/invoke CoCreateInstance from C# to allow the VB6 application to run as normal. I'm noticing that the COM object that I want to replace isn't passed through my hook. Does anyone know how VB6 loads ocx files under the hood? Am I hooking into the proper native api call? Or is what I'm trying to do impossible due to the nature of .Net? UPDATE: An alternate solution is to write a COM object to replace the old one, but we cannot get this to work. Here is an old post that I closed on the subject: Replace COM object UPDATE: After further inspection, we are able to regsvr32 /u the old ocx file and use regasm to register our .Net dll. We put a MessageBox in the constructor of our COM object and the VB6 app loads and pops the box, but it crashes as soon as it makes the first method call on the object. I suspect that we have some method signatures wrong, also we are using what tlbimp.exe gave us when we ran it on the target ocx we want to replace. Is it possible that tlbimp is making changes to the signatures that is preventing VB6 apps from loading our assembly? For example sometimes COM signature will look like: And tlbimp.exe will give C# something like: Which looks much cleaner to a C# developer.

When the laptop is resumed from ""sleep"" mode, the network connection is often gone. Someone on site has reported that when they go to the router and reset its power (or toggle the switch on the power bar) the network connection comes back instantly. Unfortunately, this solution is not sustainable. The primary user of the laptop is a person with knee and leg problems who does not want to climb the long flight of stairs to fix the router every time they wake up the laptop and the person who ""fixed"" the problem by cycling the power is not often available so can't be relied on. I personally haven't seen the problem in this situation but I know that my own computer sometimes takes 10-30 seconds on ""wake-up"" to restore the network connection (wired connection - not wireless). I am in charge of finding a more permanent solution to this problem, but since I don't normally have on-site access, it's hard to assess. Is it normal for Windows 7 to take a little bit longer when trying to re-establish a wireless network connection? Should I just say ""be patient and wait a minute or two""? Is there a way to force the OS to re-establish the connection faster? Maybe some button to click on, or a script I could write and install for them? Should I be looking at hardware problems either with the wireless router or the laptop (it's a very new laptop &amp; router which get very light usage so it's possible there are intermittent hardware problems but not enough history to properly establish a pattern)?

Consider the server as tomcat.In any webapplication whenever we submit the form , server converts the forms fields into urlencoded fields and when we do request.getParamter(""fieldName""). Server again decode it with URLDecoder. Is that correct? Does server do it or browser? Simlary when we type any url in address bar same stuff happens?

2480041,SetFilePointerEx fails to read physical disk beyond size of LONG,"It's taken a few years, but I am finally taking the plunge into VC++. I need to be able to read x number of sectors of a physical device (namely a hard drive). I am using the CreateFile() and SetFilePointerEx() and ReadFile() APIs. I have done a LOT of reading online in all the major forums about this topic. I have exhausted my research and now I feel it's time to ask the experts to weigh in on this dilemma. As this is my very first post ever on this topic, please go easy on my :) I should also point out that this is a .DLL that I consume with a simple C# app. The plumbing all works fine. It's the SetFilePointer(Ex)() APIs that are causing me grief. I can get the code to work up until about the size of a LONG (4,xxx,xxx) - I can't remember the exact value. It suffices to say that I can read everything up to and including sector # 4,000,000 but not 5,000,000 or above. The problem lies in the ""size"" of the parameters for the SetFilePointer() and SetFilePointerEx() APIs. I've tried both and so far, SetFilePointerEx() seems to be what I should use to work on 64-bit systems. The 2nd and 3rd parameters of the SetFilePointer are defined as follows: Please note that I have tried passing the LowPart and the HighPart as the 2nd and 3 parameters without any success as I get a CANNOT CONVERT LARGE_INTEGER TO PLARGE_INTEGER (for parameter 3).

2518037,Spiked vertexes on generated Icosphere,"I've been working on a program to generate an icosphere. (A sphere with evenly distributed vertexes across the face, to be used for terrain deformation) I have pretty much everything done, the sphere is generated, subdivided and drawn. The problem I am running into is that somewhere in the code, some of the vertices (the twelve starting vertexes, I believe) are being set to twice the radius, rather than just the radius. Here are three images, showing the icosphere at zero, one and two refinement passes: http://i41.photobucket.com/albums/e262/cstgirllover/Cho/Ico0Refinement.png http://i41.photobucket.com/albums/e262/cstgirllover/Cho/Ico1Refinement.png http://i41.photobucket.com/albums/e262/cstgirllover/Cho/Ico2Refinement.png and here is the code that generates the icosahedron, and then breaks it down into the icosphere: and here is the TriXYZ class, that holds the triangle data: Any help will be greatly appreciate.

2662582,"Shopping Cart: Calculate tax total using variable item tax rates, after a fixed value ($10) discount is applied","I have created my own shopping cart class and I am currently working on how tax, discounts and totals are calculated. The problem I am having is more theory based, rather than any problem with the actual code. Setup The cart allows items to be added with different tax rates per item. As item tax rates can vary, the cart tax total cannot simply be calculated by for example doing: Tax rate is 20%, so if sub-total is $100, and we add 20% tax, the tax total equals $20. Instead, the variable tax rate of each item is calculated against the items price and added to a running tax total. So far, everything is running fine. The Problem The problem occurs if a user applies a discount coupon, for example - $10 off grand total. If the grand total is $100 and I discount $10, the grand total is now $90. However, what should the tax total now be? I can't take $10 off the tax total as that is simply incorrect, and I can't take a global tax rate percentage off of $10 and then remove that from the tax total, as the cart items may have variable tax rates.

""Your app is not available in the us market"". I'm irritated about this messages and unsure if i did anything wrong because i did not use the official localization. My localization is completely build in C# and does not use ""lproj"" files. So i DO NOT have any +en.lproj or de.lproj folders in my app.bundle. The binary details in Itunes-Connect says the the following: Localizations: (""en"") Does this mean my app will not be available in the german market if it gets approved, even though my default language in Itunes Connect is ""german"" and i have added all the app-details in german? How does Itunes Connect decide in which markets the app is available?

2696586,Is there a database programming language with encapsulation to prevent the injections?,"One of things that annoys me about SQL is that it can't think in terms of objects and it's lack of encapsulation makes me constantly have to escape commands to prevent injections. I want a database language that can be polymorphic and secure. I have searched online for non-procedural database programming languages and so far my google search has been unsuccessful. I know in languages like php there are ways to prevent the injections by making the PHP encapsulated well, but not all database programming situations involve embedding the database language in another language.

My problem is, that when an admin sees that screen, he should see a certain view whereas when a user sees that screen, he should see another view. I thought I should create two views for the same screen and load the appropriate one depending on who has logged it. However, while I could do this in XIB files in prior ios versions, the storyboard does not allow me to create a view outside the viewcontroller, so i cannot design multiple views. My question is, 1. can we design two views in storyboard for the same ViewController?If yes, then how? 2. i need to see the two Views side by side so I can make changes to them separately. Having them as subviews of the main view will load both the views at runtime. I want to be able to load only one of the views depending on who has logged in Thanks in advance for your help",[],False

2803262,Convert a Ruby CSV-parsing method to C#,"I've written a simple CSV file parsing method that gets me the column numbers of the desired fields that I want (Student First Name, Student Last Name, Student ID) from a class roster csv file, which normally contains many other fields that I don't care about (hence the need to parse out what I want). However, I've written this method in Ruby and now have to incorporate it into a windows forms application, as I'm making an import wizard. From what I've gathered, I have two options, and two associated questions: 1) Convert the code to C# (.NET 3.5) (which I am not familiar with) 2) Call a Ruby API as described in the answer here (what I want to do) question 1: How difficult would it be to convert the method, taking note that I do not know C# and am an entry-level programmer? Or, if anyone wants to take a shot at it that would be awesome. Here's the ruby class I've created, that when passed a file path of the csv file will create an object for first name, last name, and id: question 2: How would I use the DLR that I've linked to to create a corresponding array in C#?

I've been a Java developer for several years, mostly working with web applications/sites. I was offered a freelance job to do on my weekends (I have a 9to6 regular job on week days) and since the extra money was appealing I accepted. Also I wanted to have some freelance experience. The job is fixing bugs on a site built in a Java-based CMS. Most bugs involve configuration issues or fixing Freemarker templates. And then also is learning the CMS which is more complex than I thought, or at least is used in a complex way. I've been doing this for two months now and more and more bugs to fix are coming, which should be a good thing, but I don't think I can do it anymore, because the CMS configuration is unusually complex for the pages it renders and there is no coding involved. These issues make the job really boring and that makes it difficult to concentrate or focus during the weekend. Now I'm expected to deliver fixes to critical bugs and I can't focus. It's taking longer than expected and I'd like to be clear and tell that I don't like the work they are giving me. It frustrates me because I'm worried that it will hurt my reputation or that I won't look as a professional. Maybe it is because there is no coding or cool issues to do.

2934382,How do I package a website to be served by tomcat?,"First, let me apologize, I'm new at web development, so I'm not quite sure how this works, but it's a simple proof of concept, so I don't think it needs to be too advanced. I have a jar that accesses a server and pulls information that needs to be displayed for the user, I also have a local site that is set up to display this information to the user via html and javascript (but obviously doesn't connect to the server or that jar). I plan on using tomcat to act as a middleware server that will display the web page and handle the code that accesses the server. I've seen it done before, but I'm not quite sure how to set it up. Can somebody just give me the basics on where things need to go to make this work? I think I'd be ok after that. My Google-Fu has failed me in finding this, so really any help is appreciated.

2939939,Backbone.js + Rails - Rendering,"I am trying to write my frist backbone + rails SPA using the ""rails-backbone"" gem. I set up my app according to the instructions here: https://github.com/codebrew/backbone-rails What I am trying to do, is render the app/assets/backbone/templates/users/new.jst.ejs in a div on my main index page (home#index) using backbone and rails somehow. The layout for the site I have in mind is a single div, including a section to sign up as a user. So far, my app/views/home/index.html.erb file looks like this: I'm guessing some sort of jquery goes into the script section to get the new.jst.ejs template, and replace #container with it (something like $(#container).html(""new.jst.ejs""). I'm just trying to wrap my head around backbone as I have only just delved into it a few days ago.

3104476,dynamically forward bounce_notice_recipient to external address using postfix,"Ok I've been banging my head over this for hours. I'm trying to forward all bounced messages to an external bounce processor regardless of domain. There are dozens of domains in use at any given time and occasionally there are domains being added and removed. In an attempt to try and keep it dynamic, I've added the following lines in postfix main.cf: From what I understand, this will forward a copy of all bounces to postmaster. I'm aware that bounced mail is returned to the sender, however the goal is to forward a copy of all bounces from all domains as long as they were sent from the local smtp. When I tried this, I received the following error: So my question is what is going on here? Is this a problem with local delivery? And how would I forward mail coming into postmaster to an external address? And the bigger question is: Is this the best strategy to deliver all bounced mail from a server, regardless of domain (without managing a list of domains), to an external address? I'll appreciate any input.","['notify_classes=bounce\nbounce_notice_recipient=postmaster\n', 'undeliverable postmaster notification discarded\n']",False

3130984,Android: Adding to App Database Not Working,"I'm writing an app that involves taking a photo, and then saving the URI of that photo in a database.

Below is my code so far for this part of the application: Database Handler TakePhotographPage Entry Class My problem is that nothing is being added to my database, instead it seems to be being added to a database in /data/data that I have no access to. If I set the KEY_ID to a number that I have not used before, then run the app and take a photo, logcat presents me with the following: http://img26.imageshack.us/img26/6526/logcat1.png If I run the app again, using the same KEY_ID, I get the following: http://img706.imageshack.us/img706/1857/logcat2.png Using SQLite Database Browser on the PC and the SQLite Manager app on the phone, I see that nothing is being entered into the database.

3137747,preventing row change in datagrid,"I have researched this and am stumped: I have a WPF DataGrid, and using an MVVM model. I want to, under certain circumstances, prevent the ability to change a row in the DataGrid. I have researched this and have tried techniques like the one found here. In practice, this works, however there is an undesirable 'flicker' (it selects the clicked row for a moment then goes back to the previous selection), while this is a close solution I wish there was a more elegant way such as preventing the row change at all in the first place. I am surprised there is not a SelectionChanging or BeforeSelectionChanged so I could cancel the event from firing; and forcibly preventing the index change in my view model does not seem to make any difference. How can I do this? Thank you.",[],False

I recently upgraded my Slackware 13.1 machine which is directly installed on a spare PC to Slackware 13.37, no issues. I did the same upgrade on my Slackware VM, and all hell has broken loose. It seems that the latest version of VMware tools installed in my guest VM just don't work, and the VM is completely unusable. I have gone through a number of patches I have found on blogs, etc, but none seem to be helpful in my case. Is anyone familiar with any kernel patches or manual patches that exist for VMware tools to support Xorg 1.9.5? I have attached my log below which I get when I either attempt to update or reinstall VMware tools on my guest VM. The most concerning part is the ""skipping X configuration"" portion below.

3174396,My JBoss server hits 100% SYS CPU on Linux; what can cause this?,"We've been debugging this JBoss server problem for quite a while. After about 10 hours of work, the server goes into 100% CPU panic attacks and just stalls. During this time you cannot run any new programs, so you can't even to get a stack trace. These high 100% SYS CPU loads last 10-20 seconds and repeat every few minutes. We have been working on for quite a while. We suspect it has something to do with the GC, but cannot confirm it with a smaller program. We are running on i386 32bit, RHEL5 and Java 1.5.0_10 using and . Here's what we have tried so far: We limited the CPU affinity so we can actually use the server when the high load hits. With we see an endless loop of and then the sig return. We tried to reproduce this with a Java program. It's true that SYS CPU% climbs high with or when accessing null pointers. Problem was that took a lot of user CPU% and that's why we never reached 100% SYS CPU. We know that after 10 hours of stress, GC goes crazy and full GC sometimes takes 5 seconds. So we assume it has something to do with memory. jstack during that period showed all threads as blocked. during that time, showed MarkSweep stack trace occasionally, so we can't be sure about this as well. Sending yielded nothing: Java dumped the stack trace AFTER the SYS% load period was over. We're now trying to reproduce this problem with a small fragment of code so we can ask Sun. If you know what's causing it, please let us know. We're open to ideas and we are clueless, any idea is welcome :) Thanks for your time.","['kill -quit', '-client', 'ParNew GC', 'strace', 'SIGSEGV', 'WeakHashMap', 'fillStackTrace', 'pstack', 'SIGQUIT']",False
3176956,Custom fields won't update,"I have a small problem with custom fields. This is what I am trying to do: Whenever a new post is added, I check what category is selected, grab the sub categories and create custom fields with a ""0"" value based on the sub categories. On each post I grab the sub categories, put them in a form and create checkboxes for each. If the checkbox is checked when the submit button is pressed, the value of the custom field is changed to ""1"". So I basically toggle the 1 and 0. If the value is 1, I use that particular custom field as a title and add some data to the post, and it also adds to the checkbox. Everything works great. The only problem I am facing is for custom fields with more than one word. Ex. ""Firefox"" works, but if the custom field is ""Firefox Browser"" it won't update. If I manually edit the post and add ""1"" to the ""Firefox Browser"" custom field, the checkbox is checked and my div shows up with the ""Firefox Browser"" title. Unchecking the checkbox and hitting submit changes the value to ""0"" but checking the checkbox won't change value to ""1"". Does anybody have any ideas why this happens? Thank you!

There should also be a way to know the cost of each item in stock and where its being held.

So, whether you write the destructor or not, every type in CLR will have a method in it (of at least). 1] So, does it mean that, every object, by default, has a finalizer ? 2] What is the basis for the CLR to decide that an object should be put through finalization queue ? I'm asking this, because, I had a class, say that implemented , but did not call in its method. The class did not hold any unmanaged resources, and there was no need for the method, which in turn meant no need for the call as there was no finalizer. 3] In context of the above scenario, is it always necessary to provide a finalizer when you implement IDisposable ?

3425613,How to Inflate Extended LinearLayout from XML,"Can anyone suggest a way to improve this API8 example? While they say the views could have been defined in XML, what they have in fact done is code them in java. I see why they wanted to. They have added some members to an extended LinearLayout, and the values are determined at runtime. According to oh, everyone in the universe, the layout directives should move to XML. But for this app, it makes sense to keep setting the text as-is in the runtime logic. So we've got a hybrid approach. Inflate the views, then populate the dynamic text. I'm having trouble figuring out how to accomplish it. Here's the source and what I tried. from API8 Examples, List4.java I figured since the LinearLayout has an android:id=""@+id/LinearLayout01"", I should be able to do this in the OnCreate but it never hits the minimal constructor I added:","['  private class SpeechView extends LinearLayout {\n     public SpeechView(Context context, String title, String words) {\n        super(context);\n\n        this.setOrientation(VERTICAL);\n\n        // Here we build the child views in code.

3550145,On the closedness of $L^2$ under convolution,"It is a direct consequence of Fubini's theorem that if $f,g \in L^1(\mathbb{R})$, then the convolution $f *g$ is well defined almost everywhere and $f*g \in L^1(\mathbb{R})$. Thus, $L^1(\mathbb{R})$ is closed under convolution, and it is a Banach algebra without unit since we have the inequality $$\|f*g\|_{1} \leq \|f\|_1 \|g\|_1 \qquad (f,g \in L^1(\mathbb{R})).$$ Now, it follows from Hölder's inequality that if $f,g \in L^2(\mathbb{R})$, then $f*g$ is bounded. My question is the following : Does $f*g$ necessarily belongs to $L^2(\mathbb{R})$? In other words, is $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ closed under convolution? Since a quick google search seem to result in a negative answer, I also ask the following question : Can you give an explicit example of two functions $f, g \in L^2(\mathbb{R})$ such that $f*g \notin L^2(\mathbb{R})$?

The problem is that I need to use a different texture coordinate for the same vertex which is shared with another face. So I thought, ""Oh I know! I'll just pack the texture coordinates with the indices instead!"" and I merrily created my data structure mapping the indexes to texture coordinates, but now I've ran into a snag: Indices need to go into the and texture coordinates need to go into the .

Furthermore, I just realized that there would no longer be a 1:1 mapping between vertex positions and texture coordinates... I have no idea how I'd rewrite my vertex shader.

But in interface concept if each derived class(es) has to define its own implementation then what is the use of inheriting it? 2.If we have to provide own implementation then why not we define that method in the derived class(es) itself.

Should all requests go through SSL even if the data in there account is not considered sensitive data? Would that slow down SSL for the important parts?

I would like to allow a program to be able to store some information for its own use during execution, but disallow access to the network and to devices, and of course to other users' data and the overall system. A few constraints: 1. This needs to be able to run on Windows. 2. I can't restrict the language (e.g. ""just use Java""). 3. It needs to have native, or near-native performance. 4. Ideally it should be able to run in the background as a service. Can I simply use a restricted-privilege windows user? Would it be safe? Do I have to use a virtualization environment?

3887307,confused about how to use JSON in C#,"The answer to just about every single question about using C# with json seems to be ""use JSON.NET"" but that's not the answer I'm looking for. the reason I say that is, from everything I've been able to read in the documentation, JSON.NET is basically just a better performing version of the DataContractSerializer built into the .net framework... Which means if I want to deserialize a JSON string, I have to define the full, strongly-typed class for EVERY request I might have. so if I have a need to get categories, posts, authors, tags, etc, I have to define a new class for every one of these things. This is fine if I built the client and know exactly what the fields are, but I'm using someone else's api, so I have no idea what the contract is unless I download a sample response string and create the class manually from the JSON string. Is that the only way it's done? Is there not a way to have it create a kind of hashtable that can be read with json[""propertyname""]? Finally, if I do have to build the classes myself, what happens when the API changes and they don't tell me (as twitter seems to be notorious for doing)? I'm guessing my entire project will break until I go in and update the object properties... So what exactly is the general workflow when working with JSON? And by general I mean library-agnostic.

4082098,Servers running from chrooted Ubuntu on HP TouchPad?,"The problem: servers appear to be broken inside my Ubuntu chroot. No matter what kind of server I try to run, they all seem unresponsive (VLC server won't respond to client, mkRemote doesn't move the cursor, Apache gives an error about binding to port 80 and won't start, etc.). If I'm not mistaken, what should normally happen inside a chroot is that all ports are shared between the chroot and the host, so if another machine tries to hit the host at port 80, it will still see the chrooted Web server. However, here, that isn't what's happening. When I run netstat from the chroot, every single process lists a foreign address of 0.0.0.0:*, meaning that the only machine which can act as a client is the local host. This is clearly incorrect and abnormal behaviour, as any process on my primary machine meant to be publicly visible lists a foreign address of :::* (which I assume means that any client can see it from any port). Edit: Disregard that; apparently the foreign address only distinguishes between whether it's listening for IPv4 or IPv6 connections, so it doesn't seem relevant here. So far, Googling has returned nothing of value, and I'm basically stumped. Any ideas? Could it just be some setting which one of the chroot patch devs enabled by default, or does it seem like a more complicated issue? Thanks.

I've made some good progress, but I'm having problems when I attempt to add location services to the mix.

To achieve this purpose, there are two approaches that I came across: http://docs.python.org/release/2.5.2/ext/callingPython.html This approach suggests to have the python callback function passed to the C side, so that the callback is called as necessary, but this doesn't work for me as I don't have access to the binary's source (which is used to run the entire system) http://stackoverflow.com/a/5721123/1126425 I have tried this approach and I get this error when the cython function is called: Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

The numbers aren't necessarily mostly smaller ""good"" numbers. The threshold would ideally be just a hair larger than most of the smaller ""good"" numbers. For example, the first vetor's ideal threshold value would be around 17 or 18, the second's would be about 8, and the third's would be around 68-70.

Sometimes they'll work with specific vectors of numbers, for example, if the standard deviation is high, but not others where the standard deviation is low.

Of course this got me to thinking, has anyone ever actually tested this? Is there any scientific evidence indicating whether or not cats can be herded?",[],False

Some details to help eliminate the obvious: 1) This is a for a shared hosting situation where I don't have root access to install mercurial-server nor can I create the ""hg"" username that it requires. 2) When I allow a user to connect via SSH to a shared hosting site, they will basically have their public key in my authorized_keys file and they will have be authenticated as me (i.e. they will have my credentials on the server). I can restrict their access to only a few hg repositories by specifying a ""command="" clause in my authorized_keys file as documented here: http://www.selenic.com/repo/hg-stable/raw-file/tip/contrib/hg-ssh.

Can I do the same without root-access to set up things? OR 2) Is there is a patch that I can add to hg-ssh such that hg-ssh can take some permissions on its command-line.

A few things to note: Neither Linux Libertine nor Linux Biolinum have much if anything in the Unicode range for math glyphs. Therefore, the Greek letters should be pulled from the Greek alphabet block and not the math Greek block, for instance.

Those files are also updated frequently (~3 times/day).

This makes updates hard/slow. SOLR and Sphinx: Both based on Lucene, they have the same problem and do not allow for identifying the line number. SQL table with a fulltext index: Again, no way to show the line number. SQL table with each line in a separate row: Tested this with SQLite or MySQL, and update performance was the worst of all options. Updating a 50 MB document took more than an hour. eXist-db: We converted each text file to XML like this: . Updates take ~5 minutes, which somewhat works but we are still not happy with it. Whoosh for Python: Pretty much like Lucene. I have implemented a prototype that sort-of works by dropping/re-importing all lines of a given file. Updating a 50MB document takes about 2-3 minutes using this method.

4897126,Grails: How to buffer outbound emails when SMTP server is temporarely down?,"Grails uses mailService from Spring. That service is synchronous, which means if SMTP goes down temporarily, application functioning is affected badly (HTTP 500). I want to decouple the application from SMTP server. The plan is to save ready-to-be-sent emails into an outbound queue and send them by timer, with retries. For my own code, when I call mailService directly, it is rather trivial - make a wrapper service and call it instead. But some of the plugins that my application uses (e.g. EmailConfirmation plugin) use the same mailService, and still fail, effectively blocking sign-up process, for instance. I wonder how can I replace/wrap the definition of mailService to make all code, my own and plugins, transparently use my own service? I.e. Plugin code injects mailService But instead of Spring default mailService my own code is injected When plugin sends a email the email object is saved to DB instead On timer a job wakes up, gets next N emails and tries to send them Any ideas how to approach this problem? P.S. I know about AsynchronousMail plugin. Unfortunately, its service must be called explicitely, i.e. it is not a drop-in replacement for mailService.",[],False

4939636,Chipersoft WMD - Yahoo Yui Reset.css - Preview Mode not working,"I wrote a custom Symfony (1.4) Textarea class to allow the ability to convert a textarea into a WMD editor. Right now I am using Chipersoft WMD along with a few Yahoo yui (v3.4.0) css libraries (reset, fonts, and grids). Everything works great, except for the WMD 'preview div', where it is supposed to render html tags as they are added/removed in the 'input textarea'. After some time narrowing down the issue, I was able to determine with 100% certainty, that it has to do with the Yahoo yui reset.css library. I was able to determine this by copying the library contents to a local file and commenting out css blocks until I could find the exact trigger which was causing the html to not render in the 'preview div'. Here is what I found to be the problem code: When I comment out this block of code, and refresh the page, the 'preview div' correctly displays any words that were flagged as bold or italic. So my question is, has anyone encountered this same issue, in using Chipersoft WMD together with Yahoo's yui reset.css library? If so how did you get around this issue? At this point the only thing I can think of is to copy the contents of reset.css to a local css file and not call the Yahoo yui version via http://yui.yahooapis.com/3.4.0/build/cssreset/reset.css, which I'd rather not do, because I'd prefer to use yahoo's bandwidth and not mine.

Both of these Schedulers trigger the same builder, but what happens now is that everyone gets build notification mails twice for each checkin; once for the code scheduler and once for the content scheduler. For example, if the following checkins go in... CL# 1000 12:00pm user_a (code) CL# 1001 1:00pm user_b (content) ...we'd see a build fire off on CL#1000 and send build notification mail to user_a. Then, a build would fire off from CL#1001 and send build notification to user_a and user_b - user_a gets two notifications that his checkin succeeded, when he should only get one. I'd like to set things up so that we have two Schedulers, but when a builder triggers and sends email, it sends notification to the number of people who checked in since that builder's last build, not that Scheduler's last build. This seems straightforward conceptually, but I haven't seen anything on this in the docs or forums. What's the right way to do this?

5457998,Android: Dynamically vary number of buttons in a custom View,"I am learning Android by implementing a clone of Mastermind. I want to break up the screen (or View) into three parts: the board with the users guesses so far and feedback, a series of control buttons, and a series of buttons to pick the color of the next peg.

Here is what I have so far (new user, so I couldn't embed the image): http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~scottm/images/android/guessfour.jpg The ""board"" is a custom View where I do a lot of drawing with a Canvas. The buttons on the bottom are declared in the layout file. Notice the orange strip to the right? Right now that is another custom View. I want to add a variable number of buttons to that custom View based on the number of colors the player can choose from. A button press would select the color for the next peg in the player's guess. (There are 3 versions of the game, easy, medium, and hard each with a different number of colors.) So, how do I add a variable number of buttons to the custom View I am creating? Or am I approaching this in the wrong way? Should I use a prebuilt layout? If so, which one and how could I dynamically change the number of buttons in the layout? Thanks for any help.

This server provides couple of protocols to connect and send command e.g. REST, SOAP, and few more. All of these protocols performs almost same set of actions, but it differes. I need to design and implement a complete client framework for it which will support all these protocols. As understand and gone through couple of internet links, it seems to me to use an abstract factory pattern and interfaces for it. my current thought for implementating it is as follows: Create a abstract factory class for Connection (ConnectionFactory).

5721614,VS2012 Web Deploy Package to create application pool,"I have a web application project in VS2012 which I'm publishing using a ""Web Deploy Package"". I want this package to include app-pool settings, specifically creating an IIS app-pool and assigning the newly created application to it. I'm familiar with the option ""Include application pool settings used by this Web project"" available when the project is configured to use an IIS instance (not IIS Express), but IIS configuration is not part of the project file, and thus not source controlled. What happens when somebody builds a deployment package on a machine that hasn't had IIS meticulously configured? Not ideal. How else then, can I go about getting AppPool settings into my web deploy package? I understand that the appPoolConfig provider is IIS7+ only, I'm fine with that limitation. I've banged my head against this issue in the past and never found a solution. 18 months later, we've got a new VisualStudio version, and a new web-publishing-pipeline, are there new options to address this? Or maybe something I missed when I first tackled this problem? Edit OK, I'm seeing the following as options: Configure my project to sync settings from an IIS instance. As mentioned, I'm not a fan of this given that it puts settings outside of the project, meaning the environment has to be meticulously configured to build + publish. Plus it drags along other IIS settings I don't want included. Inject something into the web-publishing-pipeline (WPP) to modify the archive.xml. I've toyed with this in the past and had limited success. One problem is the pipeline isn't exactly co-operative with working directly on the archive.xml file, another problem is some of the more cryptic attributes involved, like which appears to have some Base64 encoded binary? No idea what to put in there. Find an existing ""provider"" that can do what I want. I might be out of luck here, the provider only seems to want to read / write IIS, not, say, an XML file of settings. Does anybody know otherwise? Write my own ""provider"" to produce manifest output entries. I'm not sure, is it possible to write a custom provider that writes to a manifest using the name of an existing provider? As in, writes sections into a manifest? This sounds like a potentially painful exercise that may or may not work. Would I still need to figure out the encoding of whatever is going into ? I get the feeling that the fundamental obstacle with Web Deploy for what I'm trying to accomplish, is how strictly it leans on ""providers"". The pre-existing providers are largely designed for IIS synchronisation, not primary development and publication. It so happens that some of these providers can be relatively easily hooked into via MSBuild, but the majority insist on pulling data from IIS, and that's that.","['MSDeploy.MSDeployProviderOptions', 'appPoolConfig', 'MyCustomPoolProvider', 'appPoolConfig', 'MSDeploy.MSDeployProviderOptions']",False

5817620,How do I pin a local filesystem website mirroring as a pinned website in IE9?,"I don't use IE9 for all that many things, but I have become fond of the pinned websites feature for a few things I want to keep separate from my firefox tabs. I've created a reference website mirror with wget, and I want to set it up with a taskbar button for quick access, but I can't seem to get IE9 to pin the website. Dragging the tab to the taskbar causes it to open the jumplist for pinning (as with a recently opened file) instead. I'm trying editing an already pinned website's file, but local file paths don't seem to load. I've tried using both file:///C:/(local path) and C:(local path) for the URL entry.

5832629,How to migrate applications from Classic ASP to ASP.NET MVC?,"Currently, we have many web applications (external &amp; internal) developed using Classic ASP through .NET 2.0 technologies. Each of those web applications have their own login screen authenticating against their own custom database or using Windows authentication. Users have access to one or more of these applications, meaning they have to log out and log back into applications that they would like to access. All applications share some part of the back-end data sources. Also, the business logic is embedded in the UI in addition to being duplicated across applications because there is no code/business logic sharing. Screenshot #1 gives a brief idea of the existing architecture. Screenshot #2 shows the suggested architecture, which I hope will help in faster development, code/business re-usability and may be simpler maintenance. Users will access either external or internal url. In external, users will provide credentials and will be authenticated against custom database. In internal site, users will be automatically logged in using Windows authentication. After creating some samples, I have begun to like ASP.NET MVC 3. It keeps business logic separate from UI and I also like the unit testing capabilities. Here are my questions: Based on what I have found on the web so far, multiple authentications are not feasible within a single website. My understanding is that I have to host one website for each type of authentication (Forms and Windows). How do I redirect users to common landing page after they are authenticated so they can see the modules (links/menus) that they are authorized to access? Should I have to publish the same code set (dlls and content) to both the websites? Has anyone faced a similar architecture problem? If yes, could you please share the challenges that you faced and how you tackled them? What are the industry standards in designing applications of this sort? Does the suggested architecture make any sense or is it a really bad design? Are there any drawbacks in doing this in ASP.NET MVC 3? I would really appreciate your inputs. Thanks in advance.",[],False

5864213,Best failover strategy for e-mail servers on AWS to ensure high availability,"We have our e-mail server hosted on AWS. Last week Amazon had a failure in their East Coast region which brought down our server along with many others. We now want to implement a failover strategy so that if the mail server becomes unavailable again then we can simply switch to another mail server in a different zone and users can continue sending and receiving mail AS WELL AS still having access to their existing mail items. Obviously having periodic back-ups of messages isn't a good-enough solution because there is a constant stream of incoming and outgoing emails being written to disk. We are using a Windows 2008 Server and running Mailenable Enterprise. Configuration for MailEnable (eg. user accounts, passwords, etc.) are stored in an SQL Server Database on the Mail Server. We are considering the following solution: Mount S3 storage as a windows drive to store messages using a tool like tntdrive. Unlike EBS-storage (which is restricted to a single availability zone), S3 storage is available across availability zones which would make our storage available even if a single region fails. We take daily snapshots of the mail server and copy this to S3. In the case of the mail server failing we create a new instance of the mail server from our snapshot (this means that configuration changes such as password changes or new user account creation that happened since snapshot was taken will not be included, but we can accept that risk) We mount the S3 storage containing the messages as a drive on the new server. We switch the elastic ip for the mail server to the new server and we have a mail server that is available again! Will this solution work? I am a bit worried about the latency and cost of S3 as compared to EBS (see http://jimliddle.sys-con.com/node/1103438/mobile). Is there a different approach we should be looking at? Would you recommend different Amazon tools to solve the problem?",[],False

5926912,Bullseye distribution (Rayleigh distr),"Does anyone know what bullseye distribution is? It should be a special case of Weibull distribution, but I haven't found any useful information after googled it. Just for information, I heard this term from a german. So it could be some uncommon translation from german to english. And moreover, it represents a result due to a combination of independent impacts. Thanks a lot. I would say this is a proper math question though no formulae are involved. UPDATE: Thanks Ross Millikan for the answer! I have some following questions. Does Rayleigh distribtuion only represent a 2D Gaussian distribution? For completeness, this statement can be made as following: $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma)$ and $Y \sim N(\mu, \sigma)$ then $\sqrt{X^{2}+Y^{2}} \sim Rayleigh(\sigma)$ So, is there a distribution which can be explicitly written for multidimensional Gaussian distribtuion,lets say N-dim?",[],False
