13218,.Net Thread.Suspend is obsolete. Looking for an alternative,"I did some research and looking around and it seems the way to do this is using an AutoResetEvent. I quickly put this together and it seems to work and seems to be thread-safe. Can I have some feedback? EDIT: Hi Again. I have used the feedback and I am much more satisfied with my implementation. Just one little thing that I would like to add, when I pause I would like to wait to make sure that the thread has paused and is no longer doing work. Is that possible? Maybe I should just replace the pause and resume with only start and stop and then on the stop do a thred.join().

26659,Seeking CSS Browser compatibility information for setting width using left and right,"Here's a question that's been haunting me for a year now. The root question is how do I set the size of an element relative to its parent so that it is inset by N pixels from every edge? Setting the width would be nice, but you don't know the width of the parent, and you want the elements to resize with the window. (You don't want to use percents because you need a specific number of pixels.) Edit I also need to prevent the content (or lack of content) from stretching or shrinking both elements. First answer I got was to use padding on the parent, which would work great. I want the parent to be exactly 25% wide, and exactly the same height as the browser client area, without the child being able to push it and get a scroll bar. /Edit I tried solving this problem using {top:Npx;left:Npx;bottom:Npx;right:Npx;} but it only works in certain browsers. I could potentially write some javascript with jquery to fix all elements with every page resize, but I'm not real happy with that solution. (What if I want the top offset by 10px but the bottom only 5px? It gets complicated.) What I'd like to know is either how to solve this in a cross-browser way, or some list of browsers which allow the easy CSS solution. Maybe someone out there has a trick that makes this easy.",[],False

35987,Optimized Infragistics Excel,"Recently we have encounter this issue about exporting reports to excel file using infragistics library. Our report table contains more or less 1.26 million records as of now.

Our problem is when writing the excel data into the stream(file, memory). The memory consumption is just too high and when it reaches 1.8GB it will no longer continue. P.S.

94310,Rails application architecture and common setup,"So I am starting out on company project that will have several components: At first... Job list Client profile creation and management User administration and access (login, signup, roles, etc) later... Messaging Schedule Basic reporting way later... Deeper analysis and bi I'm wondering if it makes sense for each bullet item to be its own rails project, self contained and modular (if that is indeed the case); or if it's just best for it to be in the same app. I could envision a situation where each module could operate so independently of each other that it wouldn't need the rest (except for the user funcionality) and another situation where all modules would be used together. It seems like to me that many tasks can be handled with a lighter framework like Sinatra (and then situated physically under the rails app). It also seems like it would be a lot of overhead to have several rails apps running on a server. But I am not totally aware of all the pluses and minuses to operating each scenario. I know this is kind of a general question that is bound to get a lot of ""it depends"" kind of responses (and rightfully so) I was looking for opinions/examples of how you setup this kind/your kind of project in rails.

Both say: I have a feeling the problem may be related to M missing in M:.Xauthority (caused by not being run) or that $DISPLAY is somehow being disabled by a login script, but I cannot figure out what is wrong. -- update 20110628 I did not know about so that was a good guess. But alas, not the problem here. It does not exist on any of the 4 machines: As mentioned the $DISPLAY variable is not set on M, but is fine on A: The difference in output from a working session and a non-working session (Note: There are no warnings about X forwarding or xauth in the non-working session): Instaling instead of on M fixes the X-forwarding, but is an unacceptable solution.","['ssh -X Z xclock\nssh -X Z ssh -X Z xclock\nssh -X Z ssh -X A xclock\nssh -X N xclock\nssh -X N ssh -X N xclock\n', ""ssh -X N ssh -X M xclock\nError: Can't open display: \n"", '$ grep X11 &lt;(ssh Z cat /etc/ssh/ssh_config) \nForwardX11 yes\n# ForwardX11Trusted yes\n\n$ grep X11 &lt;(ssh N cat /etc/ssh/ssh_config) \nForwardX11 yes\n# ForwardX11Trusted yes\n', 'Z:/etc/ssh/ssh_config', 'M:/etc/ssh/ssh_config', 'A:/etc/ssh/ssh_config', ""terminal1$ ssh -L 8888:M:22 N\nterminal2$ ssh -X -p 8888 localhost xclock\nError: Can't open display:\n"", '/usr/bin/xauth', 'debug2: x11_get_proto: /usr/bin/xauth  list :0 2&gt;/dev/null\ndebug1: Requesting X11 forwarding with authentication spoofing.\ndebug2: channel 0: request x11-req confirm 0\ndebug2: client_session2_setup: id 0\ndebug2: channel 0: request pty-req confirm 1\ndebug1: Sending environment.\n', 'xauth', 'sshrc', '$ ls ~/.ssh/rc /etc/ssh/sshrc\nls: cannot access /home/tange/.ssh/rc: No such file or directory\nls: cannot access /etc/ssh/sshrc: No such file or directory\n', ""$ ssh -X N ssh -X M 'echo \\$DISPLAY'\n&lt;&lt;empty&gt;&gt;\n$ ssh -X Z ssh -X A 'echo \\$DISPLAY'\nlocalhost:14.0\n"", ""$ stdout ssh -X Z ssh -vX A 'echo \\$DISPLAY' &gt;/tmp/a\n$ stdout ssh -X N ssh -vX M 'echo \\$DISPLAY' &gt;/tmp/b\n$ diff /tmp/a /tmp/b\n4c4\n&lt; debug1: Connecting to A [1.1.1.5] port 22.\n---\n&gt; debug1: Connecting to M [1.1.3.3] port 22.\n23,24c23,24\n&lt; debug1: Host 'A' is known and matches the RSA host key.\n&lt; debug1: Found key in /home/tange/.ssh/known_hosts:35\n---\n&gt; debug1: Host 'M' is known and matches the RSA host key.\n&gt; debug1: Found key in /home/tange/.ssh/known_hosts:1\n43d42\n&lt; debug1: Sending env LC_ALL = en_US.UTF-8\n46c45\n&lt; localhost:14.0\n---\n&gt; \n53,54c52,53\n&lt; Transferred: sent 2384, received 2312 bytes, in 0.2 seconds\n&lt; Bytes per second: sent 10714.8, received 10391.2\n---\n&gt; Transferred: sent 2336, received 2296 bytes, in 0.0 seconds\n&gt; Bytes per second: sent 54629.1, received 53693.7\n"", 'lsh-server', 'openssh-server']",False

289647,Writing a ruby script that parses xml to distribute to non-coders,"I am creating an open source workflow that will tie an OS X application Devonthink to Zotero in the following manner: An AppleScript called inside the OS X app devonthink will run a Ruby script via the shell This Ruby script (which I find much faster, better for these sorts of things than old applescript) will make an API call and download response data in Atom format Example Data The ruby script will then parse the Atom file and extract a subset of this data and output it The Applescript will capture the output of the Ruby script and interact with devonthink in various ways, synching data. What I would like to get help for here is the parse the Atom file portion of this workflow.

I will be distributing the applescript+ruby combo to users who will likely have little or even absolutely no familiarity with the command line or installing gems etc. I would like to make this as easy as possible for the end user to simply drop my script into their applescript folder and the ruby script along with it without any further action on their part. Given this: what are your recommendations for the best solution to parse the Atom file in ruby without the need to install any gems or other tasks for the end user of the script (is there parsing code that can be simple included within the body of the script itself for example?).

359239,Is there a way to make `fill-paragraph` stop at the end of a sentence?,"It is sometimes desirable to start each sentence in a paragraph on a separate line. For instance, this makes it easier to diff large text documents, because a change in one sentence will not affect the entire paragraph. Some markup systems (e.g. *roff) also require each sentence to start on a new line. Is there a way, e.g. by judicious redefinition of and , to make stop between sentences?

Currently, will transform this into which is what I want to avoid. Update: in re sentences and paragraphs I see that my question is a bit unclear, because I used the term ""paragraph"" to refer both to what Emacs calls a paragraph and to what ends up as a continuous block of text in the output of whatever processor I use (groff, latex etc.). To clarify, I need to keep the sentences together without any blank lines between them; groff doesn't like blank lines, while latex sees them as paragraph separators. I need to operate on individual sentences, i.e. I want to redefine a paragraph as something that starts after either a blank line or the end of the previous paragraph, and ends with a period followed by either a newline character or at least two whitespace characters. I would love to have break a block of text apart into individual sentences, but I don't think it can be done easily.

394573,How to create empty local databases based on an existing .sdf file on VS2008 and SQL Server CE,"I'd like to use Visual Studio 2008 IDE for editing my local database schema for a SQL Server Compact 3.5 database. However, everything in the documentation and in the UI seems to make an assumption that the application/assembly only wants to use a single database and never wishes to create new ones based on the existing schema. I'd like to be able to edit the DB schema using visual tools and then to have a mechanism for creating new database files based on the edited schema. This way each document that my application creates would be stored in their own separate database files (.sdf). Furthermore, for the purpose of unit testing, I'd like to be able to create empty temporary .sdf files in order to run my unit tests on an empty database. The only way I know how to create new empty databases using an existing schema is just to copy my master .sdf file to a new file. What would be the recommended way to create new .sdf files using C# code? I.e., how to implement MyModel.Create(""foo.sdf"") so that it creates .sdf files using the schema I've created in Visual Studio. EDIT: After a long investigation, I ended up ditching VS2008 local database .sdf editor completely and started creating new .sdf files by using LINQ-to-SQL. I now just specify a bunch of C# classes, annotate them to work with LINQ-to-SQL and create new database files by calling my DataContext's CreateDatabase method. MSDN has a good document on it: How to: Dynamically Create a Database (LINQ to SQL)",[],False

There is a discussion website that I frequent that uses a textbox similar to what I am typing in now except that it had no accommodations to click for italics, bold, etc. People figured out that you could just add the html tags to the text being submitted and things would be formatted correctly. Then some people abused the system and started inserting IMG tags and such. The response of the website was to use a meat cleaver instead of scalpel. They seem to pre-process and strip anything with angle brackets. This not only excludes the html tags that bugged them but every html code including new paragraphs. So now every submission just looks like a massive slab of text without any formatting at all. It is clear that they are just blindly stripping anything within angle brackets because even something like ends up being So my question is: is there a way to escape the angle brackets so they get passed the pre-processing attempts.

Now Windows is turning off and turning on my hard disks several times a day. Can this on/offing be bad for the drives? The case is small and I'm trying to protect the drives from overheating really (they get VERY hot!). Edit: The accepted answer doesn't mention this explicitly, but from Minimizing hard disk drive failure Power cycling control Shutting down and rebooting a computer or resuming it from hibernation cycles the power to the drives in the computer. The spin-up operation performed by a drive after a power cycle is believed to place more stress on the drive than running the drive continuously for a long period of time. Based on professional experience of system administrators, it is believed that there is a direct relationship between the number of power cycles of a computer and the probability of failure of its drives**. In other words, a computer with a high uptime may have a lower probability of drive failure than one that has its power cycled routinely. ** Attribute #4 of S.M.A.R.T. is Start/Stop Count, which seems to indicate that start/stop count DOES play a role in disk fitness and when to expect a failure.

432583,importing c code into eclipse build,"I'm trying to import some C code into eclipse. It should be easy, I've done it before, but I've run into two odd issues. first let me describe the program though. The program is a bit unprofessionally done, but does compile and runo nt he command line. It consists of 6 seperate applications which are compiled and then run via 3 script files (the intent was to get parallel processing but it's not well designed that's why I'm working with it). There are two make files to make the code in the two sub directories of source, they are long, detailed and I want to use them rather then tring to set eclipse up to mimic all the settings in them. For some reason the makefiles were run via a shell script at the top level of the code. I tried to import the project as a ""new makefile project"" (not quite the right name, but I'm sure you know what I mean). I created a top level makefile which ran make in the lower source directories, but I kept getting exceptions that it couldn't run the makefile, as if it ws trying to treat the Makefile as an executable instead of calling make. In frustration I pointed the build command to the original scripts that call the make files below, which almost worked. Now I have two problems. 1) Eclipse reports errors stating it doesn't recognize tm_sec, tm_min, asctime, ctime, or time in one file. All of these appear to belong to the time.h file which is included at the top of the file. Likewise I've checked the time.h file is in the /usr/include directory that is linked to the project. The program still builds via command line, it's just that eclipse refuses to recognize the definition of time.h. Odder stil it doesn't complain about having varibles of type tm or time_t. 2) More importantly, I can't run debug. When I try to run one of these programs in debug mode I either can't get it to run, or it runs but in a non-useful manner. If I point the debug mode to the executable created by ecipse it will run, but while I have the ""step-into"" and ""step-return"" options the ""step-next"" option is greyed out. If I try to use step-into or step-return it will step, but it seems to jump around wildly. I don't think the source is being properly mapped to the executable file. I have checked and the -g option is in the makefile's which build the executable. I would provide the contents of the makefiles, but they are on a different computer then this one and there realy isn't a convenient way to copy contents from one computer to the other. Any ideas how I can fix either of these options? I'm fine with a solution that requires the command line for some of the work, but I really want to be able to use the eclipse debugger.

592768,mysql search engine,"I need your opinion... I am developing an application in PHP &amp; MYSQL (AZURE environment). I wrote a search engine in MYSQL for the application. The Search Engine should index pages. Each page is ""split"" to words and for each word a table is created containing all of the addresses in which the word appears. If for example the client looking for the word ""tablet"", the app access a table called ""tablet"" and will extract all the addresses in the table. If you are searching for the two words then retrieve all addresses two relevant tables and perform cutting each address. The problem is that at least 10 000 words ie 10 000 tables. Is there a problem in DATABASE that a large number of tables? Is the use of Microsoft's cloud server (AZURE) improves the situation? Is the DATABASE writing to assign the tables in the cloud or just make them and the cloud takes care for this and arrange them for me? Thank you!",[],False

596388,Input needed for balancing SQL Server write performance against read performance,"I've got a service running that transforms data and writes the transformed (a couple of million rows) data to a SQL Server. The frontend reads from these tables. Naturally, we've got an ambition to have this data written as fast as possible, but without sacrificing read performance. My current approach is writing individual rows, one server call at a time. This seems to minimize locking, but the write speed is not optimal. Unthrottled we're achieving maybe a couple of thousands of rows per second. I've also attempted to bulk load the data, but I run into deadlocks and timeouts. I'm assuming this is due to lock escalation when inserting/updating (i batch the commits in chunks of 256 rows). Any ideas for a faster way to commit the records to database without sacrificing read performance? Some details: The transformed data resides in a number of different tables, all indexed to maximize read performance. I use a single, continually open, connection to write the data.",[],False

659933,How to get Castle MonoRail's DataBinder/SmartDispatcherController to bind against types containing properties that are interfaces?,"We're using interfaces to represent entity classes in our domain model. We have concrete implementations of these by virtue of using LinqToSql. We have added a factory method to each LinqToSql class which our service layer uses to instantiate a new entity (note; as opposed to the controller's DataBind attribute doing it). MonoRail's default DataBinder implementation will ignore properties that are defined as interfaces. Ideally, we don't want to instantiate our data-layer classes in MonoRail - the whole point of the interfaces is to separate these concerns. Also, we don't really want to create another set of non-LinqToSql concrete classes whose only job is to translate between layers. It's the end of a really long day over here; please can someone have mercy and point us at the parts of IDataBinder that we should overload with our own implementations, or hint at other approaches we might attempt? ;-)",[],False

The only thing i have is Username and Password to login. So what i did was looked for the way, instagram application for Android and hopefully IOS does that. I see that it creates a request at the following url: https://instagr.am/api/v1/accounts/login/ If you would visit that link directly, you will more likely get a error saying that the page couldn't be find. After a little bit of googling, i came across a 2 years old post which states that in the Useragent, we have to contain the string ""Instagram"" for it to work. I did that by faking the useragent and the result is as follows: Now, i am guessing that we also need to add something else or some other headers too, so i was looking for a way to grab the request being sended to instagram by either of their Android or IOS app. So next i downloaded Bluestack and installed and ran instagram on my computer using this. I was able to install and login it successfully, but then i was unable to log it using Charles since the request is being sent to https:// server I also tried to grab it through Wireshark but unfortuantely, i am not much experienced in using it and hence don't know it purpose. So could anyone help me to get how to login to instagram with C# without using oAuth, cuz i just have username and password. I would probably code the end part of requesting myself, but i am unable to capture the headers being sent to instagram.

800628,How to validate this scenario in ASP.NET MVC?,"First, a little bit of context (cause I know you all love it!): I have a model called Note. It has a field called Type which, in the database, is an integer value that designates which type of object this note belongs to (1 = Customer, 2 = Sales Lead, etc). A second field called Source designates the ID of the specific object that this note belongs to. For example, if I wanted to add a note to Customer #34, I would set Type to 1 and Source to 34. To help make things a little more readable, I have an Enum called DataObjectType that contains a mapping for each of the possible Type integer values to a friendly name. So, for example, DataObjectType.Customer is the same as a value of 1 in the Type field. Next, I have a custom route: and two controller actions to handle the creation of a new note: First of all, I need to make sure that the value supplied to the {type} route value is valid for the DataObjectType enum. Can this be done with a route constraint? At the moment, the type argument of New() will accept any integer, whether it exists in DataObjectType or not. Second, I need to make sure that the object the user is trying to add the note to actually exists in the database before showing the New Note form at all. I could do this in the New() method easily, but there may come a time when a user posts the data directly to Create() without ever visiting New(). In such a case, I also need to verify that the object exists in the Create() method. What's the best way to do this in both methods without duplicating code?","['/Notes/New/{type}/{id}\n', '[AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Get)]\npublic ActionResult New(DataObjectType type, int id) {\n    Note note = new Note { Type = type, Source = id };\n    return View(note);\n}\n\n[AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post)]\npublic ActionResult Create(Note note) {\n    // This is just an example\n    note.Persist();\n    return View(""New"", note);\n}\n']",False

Initially I had two back end servers one of which was hosting Office SharePoint Server Search. However there were issues with the machine - everytime automatic updates were installed and the machine had to reboot it would hang. The machine was still pingable, but could not be accessed remotely and when we went to the server room to see what was going on, the machine was non-responsive - it wouldn't display anything just a black screen. The only thing for it was to force it to power down. After restarting everything was fine. So, we moved the service off of the problem server onto the other back end server &amp; took the problem server off of the farm. Now the remaining back end server is exhibiting the same behaviour. The Event Viewer logs are uneventful - nothing to see because that service actually stopped. I looked at the logs in the 12 hive and nothing really jumps out at me as to the cause of the problem. However, the one thing that does stand out is that the logs there don't stop - the server keeps logging the entire time that it is hung. Any thoughts as to why/how Office SharePoint Server Search is preventing the machine from shutting down?",[],False

The combo box code is more-or-less irrelevant, because trying to find the newly-generated inputs in the DOM by going through the form doesn't seem to work. I'm not sure if they even exist. First, I have the form itself: Then lower, there's the table that will contain the generated cells: A bit above, there is my heinous script function that populates the table: The reason we don't care about the onClick and onKeyUp is because we never get to that point. What's supposed to happen is that the eval() is supposed to run some javascript that populates the combo boxes with some predefined variables. It works perfectly, as long as the inputs are static. However, when I hit the button that runs this script, it pukes on that combohandleKeyUp right near the beginning, where it is supposed to find the following object: Obviously this is all variables inside the script itself, but that's what it parses out to according to the debugger. When I use Firebug's DOM inspector, I can find the forms, I can find WEB070EDIT, but I can't find the hidden input P2_MATERIAL_1.

1261289,Querying Alternative Solutions in Prolog.NET,"I am a university student, who's quite new to Prolog. I am currently developing a C# Application which should be integrated with Prolog using any suitable prolog-C# library. I have found Prolog.NET (Developed by Ali Hodroj) to be a pretty good solution for my scenario and it suits my requirements as well. However, I am having a little trouble when querying alternative solutions for a particular predicate when using it. For instance, a predicate like, will have only one particular answer, which would be 3 if the user entered 1 and 2 for X and Y respectively. But, if the daughter(X,Y) predicate is queried as daughter(bobby,D), the D will have two values which are emma and maria, which can be iterated by pressing "";"" in a Prolog environment. But when using C# with Prolog.NET, I can only get one particular value. For example: When invoking the above daughter(X,Y) method from the C# environment, it will only return me one particular solution (emma), what I require is to get the other solution which is maria as well. I have tried many things but I cannot seem to get the other value/s no matter what. I would really appreciate if someone can tell how this can be achieved!

1279670,Fire an event after a local delete jqgrid,"So what I am trying to do is fire an event AFTER a local delete has been done on the jqgrid. The reason for this is because I am dealing with a global save on the website so I am not posting directly to the server. I am storing the data in JSON form within a hidden element on the page so when the user finally saves the element value is grabbed and sent to the server along with all the other data. The issue I am having is that when I delete a row from the jqgrid I am not able to update the hidden element with the change, so if the user saves after that it is like the remove never happened. As indicated in the code above I am successfully updating the hidden element with the changes on both add and edit (inline) via afterrestorefunc, but this is not working for delete. I have tried using afterSubmit in the code above, but this is not working either. I have been working on this for a few days now and have come to the conclusion that I might have to write my own custom code for the delete button entirely, but I am hoping this is not the case. Thanks for your help in advance!!!! UPDATE!!!!! So it appears as though I was staring at the issue for too long and was missing the obvious....lucky me. Well since lightening hit me straight in the face I thought I would post an update (since it won't let me answer my own question for another 4 hours). I found out two things: Using afterSubmit was the wrong thing to use, instead I should be using afterComplete. I had tried using afterComplete before trying afterSubmit and the reason it was not working it because I am putting them both within the ""add"" parameters and NOT the delete. Once again, I feel pretty awesome for that one :) Well now that I have figured that out here is the code snippet that saved my life: This is tested and the function is called after the delete has been performed and saves the local changes to my hidden element.

All of my CheckBox controls are set to use the Tahoma font (the default for controls), but one of them is showing as Verdana. That is, it says Tahoma in the properties dialog, but the font actually used to display the text is Verdana (both at design time and at run time). [Now, I should mention that I did mess around with the fonts for a while, and Verdana was one of the fonts I used at one point, but now I've set everything back to Tahoma.] You're probably thinking - just delete and re-create the CheckBox. Tried that. I also tried copying one of the CheckBoxes that displays correctly. No joy. Here's the really crazy thing: the CheckBox (or any other CheckBox I create) only shows as Verdana if it's at a particular position on the form. If I move it up or down a couple of notches, it's fine. Any CheckBox I move into this particular position magically shows as Verdana until I move it somewhere else. Unfortunately, I need it to be in that position (and not be Verdana)! I've battled with this for hours, and tried exporting and re-importing the code, saving as a Word 2007 document (I was originally using 2003), everything I can think of short of re-creating the form from scratch (which I don't want to do, as it's huge). I presume that there's some sort of corruption of the form, but the saved .frx file is in a binary format, so I can't check (or edit) it. Anyone seen this problem? Any solutions out there? EDIT: I said above that the problem CheckBox shows as Verdana. That's not correct. I've established by trial-and-error that it's actually Tahoma - but at 9pt instead of 8pt.

1337987,Any hidden pitfalls changing a column from varchar(8000) to varchar(max)?,"I have a lot (over a thousand places) of legacy t-sql code that only makes INSERTs into a varchar(8000) column in a utility table. Our needs have changed and now that column needs to be able to handle larger values. As a result I need to make that column varchar(max). This is just a plain data column where there are no searches preformed on it, no index on it, only one procedure reads it, it is INSERT and forget for the application (almost like a log entry). I plan on making changes in only a few places that will actually generate the larger data, and in the single stored procedure that processes this column. Are there any hidden pitfalls changing a column from varchar(8000) to a varchar(max)? Will all the t-sql string functions work the same, LEN(), RTRIM(), SUBSTRING(), etc. Can anyone imagine any reason why I'd have to make any changes to the code that thinks the column is still varchar(8000)?",[],False

1431614,RRAS DNS Entries from Windows Vista / 7 Clients,"How do I stop a Win 2003 RRAS server from sending it's own DNS info to the VPN Client? We have RRAS running on Win 2003 Server. The server has a fixed IP, but the RRAS is setup to use DHCP for assigning VPN client IPs. Our DHCP is setup to send 4 DNS server entries in this order: Internal DNS Server Backup Internal DNS Server External DNS Server Backup External DNS Server Here's the thing: the RRAS server seems to automatically send it's own DNS entries (from it's NICs) to the client first, and then the entries from DCHP are applied. But since the RRAS server has Internal DNS and Backup Internal DNS as it's own DNS entries, it sends these first, and when the DCHP DNS entries come down, only the ones not already added get added (just the externals). This results in the following DNS list on the VPN client: External DNS Server Backup External DNS Server Internal DNS Server Backup Internal DNS Server This is no good of course, because internal names will no longer resolve. How do I stop the RRAS server from sending it's own DNS info to the VPN Client?

The map renders, but point features (any features really) in my database are not showing up on the map, and when trying to register points through the map interface, I get an error that: I realized from the geodjango docs that the Googles spatial reference system is not included when initializing the spatialite/sqlite database, and the solution should be to issue the following commands, to add the SRS: However, when I do this from my project directory, I get: I have confirmed that GDAL, GEOS and PROJ4 is installed, and I have added environment variables GDAL_DATA and PROJ_LIB to my .profile. I have checked the /usr/local/share/gdal/gcs.csv file which appears to not have an entry for 900913 (I have googled for other versions of gcs.csv, but none seem to contain 900913). I assume this is causing the error. However, the cubewerx_extra.wkt in the same directory does have a WKT entry for 900913. My question is: How do I make add_srs_entry find the right SRS representation in order to add it to my database? Or is there a work-around, e.g. somehow converting the WKT representation and inserting it manually in gcs.csv? I appreciate any help! EDIT: I found a way to manually insert the EPSG 900913 into the spatialite database. The solution is inspired by the sql-statement found at http:// trac.osgeo.org/openlayers/wiki/SphericalMercator (sorry, I don't have enough reputation to post more links) and issued to the database backend using raw sql (as described in the docs at https:// docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/sql/#executing-custom-sql-directly): I've confirmed that the entry is now in the spatial_ref_sys table. But I am still getting the same error when trying to add points in the admin-interface. Points can be added to the map, but when trying to save the feature, I get the error: Is the above sql statement correct? Is it sufficient, or does the add_srs_entry do other things as well?

1495599,Convert UTC offset to timezone or date,"A head scratcher for you. I am grabbing geo IP data from IPInfoDB's API and it returns a timezone offset from UTC including DST (if currently reflected). For example, I live in EST (-5) and currently it's DST, so the geo IP API returns () as the offset. This is wonderful since DST is a freaking headache. But to my surprise, it caused another headache. I load this data in PHP to be passed via AJAX to the application. I would like to have the live local time of the IP address on the app. I have that all set perfectly, but I am going crazy trying to figure out how to set the PHP timezone to match the offset so I can just grab the current hours and minutes to pass to via AJAX. I am unsure if there is a specific function that can just give me the current hours and minutes based on that offset or if there is a practical way to set the timezone based on the offset (which will have DST already applied if is in effect). I've been searching and searching Google to find an answer to this, but what I am doing is more specific since DST is already applied. I found one function on PHP.net that seems to do the trick (it works for my timezone and returns the correct time) although for other timezones such as PST, it's returning 1 hour later than it should be even though the offset is correct ( with DST). The timezone returned from the function is which I have a feeling is the cause. If I could, I would make this only work for the USA, but I do need it to be worldwide. This is the function I have now. Please excuse the extremely messy code. I have been playing around with tons of things over the last few hours trying to figure out a solution. Most of the functionality was found online. I included the switch/case for certain timezones that are and out there. There may be a way to include that also without the need of the switch/case. NOTE: The offsets are always returned as such or from the geo IP API. I would appreciate any help or a point in the right direction. I'm not very novice with PHP, but offsets are a new story for me.

It's lots of HTML files (around 300 of them) that he insists on keeping flat HTML files so can easily edit and manage them using Dreamweaver. His site has a lot of traffic and so I'm looking into options of keeping things simple for him. He does insist on this method for the time being, I hope to win him around eventually. I'm slowly moving him off his expensive shared hosting package (he maxes it out constantly due to traffic) and getting him on a VPS so I have more control over what I can install and the resources are more flexible etc. My issue is, there is some parts of the site that are in PHP. The small admin area he uses to do his newsletters for example sits separately away and he still requires this function. I'm thinking that since I'd have him on a server I can install what I like on, I want to start incorporating Django into the site. I'd much more prefer to do Django development for any admin type situation then trying to hack or make something with PHP. I know about the PHP frameworks out there, but they just don't appeal in this particular situation. Due to this massive set of HTML files, is it possible to basically allow Django to carry on serving these up as they are... He can edit and upload them with Dreamweaver as he always has... But Django is 'there' for the admin side of it which he can do his newsletter? Eventually he is wanting translations for the pages and login for visitors (again which I'd like to do with Django) but for the time being I'm in this transitional period and wanting to do things step by step. Aside note, he has a forum that is in PHP, which he also wants to keep... So I'm thinking a carefully setup combination of Nginx, FastCGI and Gunicorn so static, PHP and Django respectively can co-exist on the same server. Is this just foolish, or totally possible?

If I have toggled music on or off, pause doesn't work anymore for some reason. This is pause code: So that's my problem. The same problem occurs with toggle sound: if I toggle sound off, it works and there is no sound anymore (sounds like when my fish eats another fish or game over sound), but when I toggle sound on again, it doesn't work: no sound is played when it should be played. My guess is that it has something to do with the booleans. I don't know what's wrong with my code though, what am I doing wrong?

1767915,Can I use Outlook 2010 (beta) with OWA account?,"One of the new features of Outlook 2010 (beta) is the support for multiple Exchange accounts. I'm wondering if there is any way to use this together with a (different) Outlook Web Access account to also get that email in Outlook. Specifially, in additional to my regular corporate (Exchange) account, I also use another corporate account through OWA. With this second account, the only supported access is through OWA; while POP3 access is available, it is not actually suported. I'm not very familiar with configuring Exchange servers, but in talking to those who are, it sounds like enabling Outlook Web Access is (slightly) different than allowing access from Outlook via HTTP(s). Is that correct? If so, it doesn't really semm quite right as absolute worst-case, one could (theoretically) resort to screen-scraping OWA. Edit: this looks to be about the same as Activesync/OWA Desktop Client?

1794253,Edit and render RichText,"We have an application (a custom network management tool for building automation) that supports printing labels that you can cut out and insert into the devices' front displays. In earlier versions of the tool (not developed in my company), the application just pushed the strings into an Excel file that the field technician could then manipulate (like formatting text). We didn't do this in the new version because it was hard (impossible) to keep the Excel file in sync, and to avoid a binding to an external application (let alone different versions of Excel). We're using PDFSharp for rendering the labels. It has a System.Drawing-like interface, but can output to a System.Drawing.Graphics (screen / printer) as well as to a PDF file, which is a requirement. Later, basic formatting was introduced like Font Family, Style, Size, Color which would apply to one label (i.e. to exactly one string). Now the customer wants to be able to apply these formats to single characters in a string. I think the easiest way would be to support a subset of RichText. It's not as easy as I thought though. Currently the editor just displays a TextBox for the label you want to edit, with the font set to the label's font. I thought I'd just replace it with RichTextBox, and update the formatting buttons to use the RichTextBox formatting properties. Fairly easy. However, I need to draw the text. I know you can get the RichTextBox to draw to a HDC or System.Drawing.Graphics - but as already said, I need it to use PDFSharp. Rendering to bitmaps is not an option, since the PDF must not be huge, and it's a lot of labels. Unfortunately I couldn't get the RichTextBox to tell me the layout of the text - I'm fine with doing the actual rendering by hand, as long as I know where to draw what. This is the first question: How can I get the properly layouted metrics of the rich text out of a RichTextBox? Or is there any way to convert the rich text to a vector graphics format that can be easily drawn manually? I know about NRTFTree which can be used to parse and manipulate RichText. The documentation is bad (actually I don't know, it's Spanish), but I think I can get it to work. As far as I understood, it won't provide layouting as well. Because of this, I think I'll have to write a custom edit control (remember, it's basically just one or two line labels with basic RTF formatting, not a full-fledged edit control - more like editing a textbox in PowerPoint) and write custom text layout logic that used PDFSharp rather than System.Drawing for drawing. Is there any existing, even if partial, solution available, either for the editing or for doing the layout manually (or both)? Or is there an entirely different approach I'm just not seeing? Bonus points if exporting the label texts as RTF into a CSV file, and then importing in Excel retains the formatting. For the editing part, I need it to work in Windows Forms.

You get Group objects from a File object. I've written some code in which I create a object and attempt to get a from it. I am trying to make my Node.js module as Javascripty as possible, so I want to return the group using a callback. So, I am trying to code my module so that it's used like this: So, in the C++ code for my wrapper, I'd have a function that maps to the function here, and it'd call the given anonymous function, passing in any errors as well as the new object wrapper. Given that this sounded to me like what the Node.js documentation shows to be a factory of wrapped objects, I have modeled my code after the examples there. So, I have my wrapper coded up, but am stuck trying to instantiate it. I don't know enough yet to know how to stray away from using the v8 class for function parameters. Because of that, I can't seem to be able to pass in some parameters that I need for my v8 persistent constructor function (because I am instantiating this from C++, and not from JS-land).

Is there a way I can develop the app, which I will get a developer to do rather than myself, with WP7 as the lead platform and then make a relatively simple conversion to the other platforms or do apps generally have to be completely reworked for each platform? Also, just to though it out there, any idea of where to go to find a freelance app developer? Thanks James",[],False

2158697,General MongoDb database design and index performance - one or many collections?,"This is a general question about mongodb database design, but the reason for my question is that I am designing a database for a system where I generate static html files for a lot of small websites. The websites can contain different types of pages, some are lists of users, some are lists of other pages and some are just static information pages. Now I am wondering whether it would be better to have one collection of Pages to store data for all the different kind of website pages or whether it would be better to have several collections - one collection for each type of page. If I only use one collection, then this would probably end up with many indexes on a table with many entries, including indexing by type of page. If a use several collections, then each collection would be smaller and have a few indexes, including one for each collection on the id field. My gut feeling is that it in general would be better to go with several collections, because then the data is already have one level of indexing by having them in different collections. But what if the number of different collections is like 100 ?

2172545,apache+mod_wsgi configuration for django project(s) on a quad core,"I've been experiment quite some time with a ""typical"" django setting upon nginx+apache2+mod_wsgi+memcached(+postgresql) (reading the doc and some questions on SO and SF, see comments) Since I'm still unsatisfied with the behavior (definitely because of some bad misconfiguration on my part) I would like to know what a good configuration would look like with these hypotesis: Quad-Core Xeon 2.8GHz 8 gigs memory several django projects (anything special related to this?) These are excerpts form my current confs: EDIT: I've added more stuff to make this complete but following Graham's suggestion I will follow up on the wsgi mailing list apache2 -v) apache2 conf ... wsgi.py Currently using version 3.3 built from source folder structure in case it matters (slightly shortened actually) Please forgive me in advance if I overlooked something obvious. My main question is about the apache2 wsgi settings. Are those fine? Is 25 threads an /ok/ number with a quad core for one only django project? Is it still ok with several django projects on different virtual hosts? Should I specify 'process'? Any other directive which I should add? Is there anything really bad in the wsgi.py file? I've been reading about potential issues with the standard wsgi.py file, should I switch to that? Or.. should this conf just be running fine, and I should look for issues somewhere else? So, what do I mean by ""unsatisfied"": well, I often get quite high CPU WAIT; but what is worse, is that relatively often apache2 gets stuck. It just does not answer anymore, and has to be restarted. I have setup a monit to take care of that, but it ain't a real solution. I have been wondering if it's an issue with the database access (postgresql) under heavy load, but even if it was, why would the apache2 processes get stuck? Beside these two issues, performance is overall great. I even tried New Relic and got very good average results. edit I will not be able to provide an answer myself as I have, temporarily, moved to an nginx+gunicorn environment. Also follow up on google groups for my personal situation and issues! Sounds like Graham is, of course, really busy (mod_wsgi is a free side project!) but moving to Read The Docs sounds great, and solving that one backlog issue would be totally awesome. That and the new Apache 2.4 might make me reconsider the best combo (currently nginx+gunicorn, then I might drop nginx for a varnish+apache+mod_wsgi setting)","['Server version: Apache/2.2.12 (Ubuntu)\nServer built:   Nov 18 2010 21:16:51\nServer\'s Module Magic Number: 20051115:23\nServer loaded:  APR 1.3.8, APR-Util 1.3.9\nCompiled using: APR 1.3.8, APR-Util 1.3.9\nArchitecture:   64-bit\nServer MPM:     Worker\n  threaded:     yes (fixed thread count)\n    forked:     yes (variable process count)\nServer compiled with....\n -D APACHE_MPM_DIR=""server/mpm/worker""\n -D APR_HAS_SENDFILE\n -D APR_HAS_MMAP\n -D APR_HAVE_IPV6 (IPv4-mapped addresses enabled)\n -D APR_USE_SYSVSEM_SERIALIZE\n -D APR_USE_PTHREAD_SERIALIZE\n -D SINGLE_LISTEN_UNSERIALIZED_ACCEPT\n -D APR_HAS_OTHER_CHILD\n -D AP_HAVE_RELIABLE_PIPED_LOGS\n -D DYNAMIC_MODULE_LIMIT=128\n -D HTTPD_ROOT=""""\n -D SUEXEC_BIN=""/usr/lib/apache2/suexec""\n -D DEFAULT_PIDLOG=""/var/run/apache2.pid""\n -D DEFAULT_SCOREBOARD=""logs/apache_runtime_status""\n -D DEFAULT_ERRORLOG=""logs/error_log""\n -D AP_TYPES_CONFIG_FILE=""/etc/apache2/mime.types""\n -D SERVER_CONFIG_FILE=""/etc/apache2/apache2.conf""\n', 'PidFile ${APACHE_PID_FILE}\nTimeout 60\nKeepAlive Off\n\nServerSignature Off\nServerTokens Prod\n#MaxKeepAliveRequests 100\n#KeepAliveTimeout 15\n# worker MPM\n&lt;IfModule mpm_worker_module&gt;\n    StartServers          2\n    ServerLimit           4\n    MinSpareThreads       2\n    MaxSpareThreads       4\n    ThreadLimit          32\n    ThreadsPerChild      16\n    MaxClients          64#128\n    MaxRequestsPerChild   10000\n&lt;/IfModule&gt;\n', 'SetEnv VHOST null \n#WSGIPythonOptimize 2\n\n&lt;VirtualHost *:8082&gt;\n    ServerName subdomain.domain.com\n    ServerAlias www.domain.com\n    SetEnv VHOST subdomain.domain\n    AddDefaultCharset UTF-8\n    ServerSignature Off\n\n    LogFormat ""%{X-Real-IP}i %u %t \\""%r\\"" %&gt;s %b \\""%{Referer}i\\"" \\""%{User-agent}i\\"""" custom\n    ErrorLog  /home/project1/var/logs/apache_error.log\n    CustomLog /home/project1/var/logs/apache_access.log custom\n\n    AllowEncodedSlashes On\n\n    WSGIDaemonProcess subdomain.domain user=www-data group=www-data threads=25\n    WSGIScriptAlias / /home/project1/project/wsgi.py\n    WSGIProcessGroup %{ENV:VHOST}\n&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;\n', 'import os\nimport sys\n\n# setting all the right paths....\n\n\n_realpath = os.path.realpath(os.path.dirname(__file__))\n_public_html = os.path.normpath(os.path.join(_realpath, \'../\'))    \n\nsys.path.append(_realpath)\nsys.path.append(os.path.normpath(os.path.join(_realpath, \'apps\')))\nsys.path.append(os.path.normpath(_public_html))\nsys.path.append(os.path.normpath(os.path.join(_public_html, \'libs\')))\nsys.path.append(os.path.normpath(os.path.join(_public_html, \'django\')))\n\n\nos.environ[\'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE\'] = \'settings\'\n\nimport django.core.handlers.wsgi\n\n_application = django.core.handlers.wsgi.WSGIHandler()\n\ndef application(environ, start_response):\n    """"""\n    Launches django passing over some environment (domain name) settings\n    """"""\n\n    application_group = environ[\'mod_wsgi.application_group\']\n    """"""\n    wsgi application group is required.

2213156,what is the concept behind java iterator?,I am doing a research on java interface and cannot understand why it is designed like that. Why java iterator use and instead merge them into one method? this a typical usage of java iterator why not It is clear this approach looks ugly but what happen if return null for when reach to end instead throw an exception? than code can be simplify to this is how NSEnumerator in Objective-C works This increase the overhead of implement custom . This also make java iterator not thread-safe. For example an ArrayList have one element in it. Two threads both ask for a same iterator for that list at same time. Than both threads will see and they will invoke on that iterator. Because there is only one element and iterator has been asked twice which definitely will lead to an exception or error state. I know there are thread-safe iterator but I am not sure hot it implement but I think lots blocking are happening which make it inefficient.

The script I'm working on is pretty simple (in theory). I just don't know where to begin and was hoping for some advice that will lead me in the right direction. -The script is essentially a simple data logger. -Everyday the user logs into the website, where it brings them to a single page. -The user then checks an input box and enters a value into another input box -That number is stored in the database That's pretty much it. It seems pretty simple, but the problem is that there needs to be one administrator account that can read all the inputs of all other users. My Question: What is the BEST way to start this project? I have absolutely no clue on how to start it. Should I create classes for each of the functions (user logging in, user inputting value)? Should I use a framework? What would be the first steps you would take as a programmer. I know this isn't a specific question, but like I said, I'm new to writing scripts that involve dealing with the backend and all that fun stuff. Thanks in advance.",[],False

2342727,Can the C preprocessor be used to tell if a file exists?,"I have a very large codebase (read: thousands of modules) that has code shared across numerous projects that all run on different operating systems with different c++ compilers. Needless to say, maintaining the build process can be quite a chore. There are several places in the codebase where it would clean up the code substantially if only there were a way to make the pre-processor ignore certain #includes if the file didn't exist in the current folder. Does anyone know a way to achieve that? Presently, we use an #ifdef around the #include in the shared file, with a second project-specific file that #defines whether or not the #include exists in the project. This works, but it's ugly. People often forget to properly update the definitions when they add or remove files from the project.

I use quotes on ""safe""/""unsafe"" because there is much debate as to the benefits of certain Standard Library functions or their putatively improved alternatives. Many traditional Standard C Library functions (e.g., ) are considered to be unsafe due to the potential for buffer overflow or other security problems. On Windows, the Microsoft C/C++ compilers provide the ""_s"" functions (e.g., ) as a safer alternative to the standard library calls. These functions are not drop-in replacements since they have the different signatures necessary to provide additional safety information (e.g., buffer length). They also provide other features such as invalid format string detection, different file security, etc. As far as I know, this implementation is not available on the Mac. Does Apple (or a third party) provide anything similar for use with GCC on OSX? In particular, I'm looking for ""safe"" implementations of at least the following functions: fopen vfprintf vsprintf sprintf strncpy strcpy strcat Please note: This question is about the Mac. I am NOT asking for your opinions about Microsoft's implementation (unless it's available on the Mac.) Although some of these functions might be easy to write myself, not all are. I am NOT asking how to write these myself. I'm NOT asking for tips on how to use STL classes to do this. I'm NOT asking how to turn off warnings. My particular needs are very specific. I'm trying to identify a best-practice Mac API that is as similar as possible to the traditional C library calls while adding safety.

2501950,Android - Make scrollbar in HorizontalScrollView clickable,"I'm using a in one of my layouts and replaced the scroll bar track and the thumb by overriding the according xml attributes, so that the track represents thumbnails of the views within the and the thumb indicates the current position. This works fine so far and I can scroll within the view. However, I cannot use the scroll bar, i.e. the track and the thumb for scrolling, I can only scroll via flings on top of the whole view. Every click/fling on top of the scroll bar is simply interpreted like a click/fling elsewhere in the . In other words, I can't drag the thumb and thereby change the position, nor can I jump to a certain position by clicking somewhere on the scroll bar track. Here is my layout: Unfortunately I couldn't find any solution to this problem yet EDIT: I just found out that the scroll bar is not supposed to work this way in Android, see here Does anyone have an idea, how I could implement the desired behaviour explained above? No code needed, just suggestions! EDIT 2 (Workaround): To the ones who are interested in my solution: I put a transparent dummy view on top of the scrollbar of the same size and set an to this view. In the method of the listener I then calculate the relative position of the touch event as far as the track bar is concerned and then jump to the same relative position within the via the method: where mScrollBarWidth is the width of the scrollbar (essentially the screen width) and mScrollViewWidth is the width of the in total.

From here, I'm not sure where to go. Is my proof clear? Or is it missing some needed information? Thanks in advance for any suggestions or help.",[],False

2700046,OpenGL camera parenting,"I have a camera object in my OpenGL renderer. It works fine. However I need to parent it to a parent node so that the parent can manipulate camera as it is done in Adobe AfterEffects with Null Object. If you are not familiar with AE, so here is how it works. Null Object is an empty container. If the camera is parented to it and the object itself is located at the target position then the camera, having its point of interest (aka lookAt) at the target would orient around the target when null object is rotated. That is the core of the problem.In my implementation, when I rotate the parent, which has the camera as child and is located at target's position, the camera doesn't remain locked at the parent's position but its lookAt direction changes too. Here is the screenshot depicting the issue: At the left screenshot is the wrong behavior:Camera's parent is at the center but the camera's direction is rotating instead of the camera. At the right screenshot that is how it should be and how it works in AE: rotating the Null Object rotates the camera around the null object center axis. I am sure I do some stupid wrong matrix order thing here. So here is how I do in the code: I calculate camera's lookAt matrix like this: The Glm:lookAt is the port from C++ GLM math lib and it looks like this: So that is the first part , where I create camera ""model"" matrix.Nex step is create the world matrix taking into account camera's parent node: Later in the pipeline, view matrix of the camera (which I just have set with setView) is accessed by each geometry object which going to be rendered, and model, view, projection matrix is calculated and then sent to vertex shader. The strange thing is, if I invert world matrix before passing it into method and don't negate eye vector in GLM, then it works!But in such a case it doesn't work in a mode where the camera is not parented.

Can it be done? If not here is my issue which someone maybe be able to help with. I created an app which I have set to Landscape and I have set PageOrientation to LandscapeLeft. Due to the phone moving it obviously rotates sometimes to LandscapeRight which I don't want it too. So I did this Problem solved, how ever, I showed my friends the app and they had a play. A few of them preferred it to be the other way round (LandscapeRight) due to the phone buttons and the way they held the phone. To satisfy the users of my app I wanted to put a setting which they can change based on if they wanted LandscapeLeft or LandscapeRight. As I can't change the orientation in code behind how could I accomplish this? I did try messing around with screen rotation which I sort of got working i.e app is always set to LandscapeLeft and if they wanted it LandscapeRight then simply rotate transform 180*. But the main issue was MessageBox's would appear upside down.",['protected override void OnOrientationChanged(OrientationChangedEventArgs e)\n{\n     if(e.Orientation == PageOrientation.LandscapeLeft)\n          base.OnOrientationChanged(e); \n}\n'],False
2859643,Creating Global MMFs with full access,"I'm using Memory Mapped Files with .NET, C# to pass data between processes on a Windows machine. I'm also using a mutex for synchronization. I had to make the MMFs and the Mutex Global (by adding ""Global\"" to their names) because the processes can be run by different users at the same time. The MMFs and the Mutex are created by the first process that happens to run, and the other processes just open the existing MMFs whenever they need to Read/Write to it: The problem is that I get a System.UnauthorizedAccessException if the first process (the one that will create the MMFs) does not run on an admin account. This is the code for creating the MMFs: The error: If I create the MMFs from a process that runs on an admin account, I have no problem in opening/reading/writing it from another processes. But when I try to create it from an user acount, I keep getting this error. Is that because it's only possible to create a Global MMF with full access rights from an admin account ? Sorry for the long question, but this is a really big issue for me. I was even thinking on throwing away the MMFs and using disk files, despite the decrease in performance.

2914782,Direct aproach to the Closed Graph Theorem,"In the context of Banach spaces, the Closed Graph Theorem and the Open Mapping Theorem are equivalent. It seems that usually one proves the Open Mapping Theorem using the Baire Category Theorem, and then, from this theorem, proves the Closed Graph Theorem. I was wondering about a more direct approach to the Closed Graph Theorem. What I want to show, possibly using the Baire Category Theorem, but without the Closed Graph Theorem or any of its equivalent theorems, that if $T: X \to Y$ is not continuous, then, there is a convergent sequence $x_n \rightarrow x$ such that $T x_n \rightarrow y \neq Tx$. Of course, $X$ and $Y$ are Banach Spaces. Because $T$ is not bounded, I know that there is a sequence $a_n$ of unitary vectors such that $T a_n \rightarrow \infty$. Now, taking $b_n = \frac{a_n}{\|T a_n\|}$, we have that $b_n \rightarrow 0$, and $\|T b_n\| = 1$. I wonder, if there is a simple argument for constructing a $x_n \rightarrow x$, based on $a_n$ or $b_n$, such that $T x_n$ is a Cauchy Sequence, but such that $\|T x_n\|$ is ""far from"" $\|T x\|$. Of course, $x_n$'s construction would have to use the fact that $X$ is complete. For example, $x$ could be the limit of an absolutely convergent sequence, pretty much in the same fashion as the construction in the proof of the Open Mapping Theorem.",[],False

The Repository object has the responsibility of sending requests to the API to retrieve information, using the information stored in the Authenticator. An example of this is Repository.List() [It's not really static, just writing it this way for brevity). Conceptually, this is what List() should do. Try to connect to API and get a list of items If 401 error, re-authenticate and try again Return the list of items or throw an exception This pattern will be used for all of my methods in all of my repositories, so I'd like a delegate or something that I could use with all of the API calls.

3154388,How can I randomize this text generator even further?,"I'm working on a random text generator -without using Markov chains- and currently it works without too many problems -actually generates a good amount of random sentences by my criteria but I want to make it even more accurate to prevent as many sentence repeats as possible-. Firstly, here is my code flow: 1-Enter a sentence as input -this is called trigger string, is assigned to a variable- 2-Get longest word in trigger string 3-Search all Project Gutenberg database for sentences that contain this word -regardless of uppercase lowercase- 4-Return the longest sentence that has the word I spoke about in step 3 5-Append the sentence in Step 1 and Step4 together 6-Assign the sentence in Step 4 as the new 'trigger' sentence and repeat the process. Note that I have to get the longest word in second sentence and continue like that and so on- And here is my code: import nltk According to my code, once I enter a trigger sentence, I should get another one that contains the longest word of the trigger sentence I entered. Then this new sentence becomes the trigger sentence and it's longest word is picked. This is where the problem sometimes occurs. I observed that despite the code lines I placed - starting from line 47 to the end- , the algorithm still can pick the same longest word in the sentences that come along, not looking for the second longest word. For example: Trigger string = ""Scotland is a nice place."" Sentence 1 = -This is a random sentence with the word Scotland in it- Now, this is where the problem can occur in my code at times -doesn't matter whether it comes up in sentence 2 or 942 or zillion or whatever, but I give it in sent.2 for example's sake- Sentence 2 = Another sentence that has the word Scotland in it but not the second longest word in sentence 1. According to my code, this sentence should have been some sentence that contained the second longest word in sentence 1, not Scotland ! How can I solve this ? I'm trying to optimize the code as much as possible and any help is welcome.

3242914,System C Command and Memory Limit?,"Okay, so i am currently attempting to debug a problem on a win2003 server. Basically we have an ancient program that calls C's function. Now i basically tracked it down to the fact that when the system() runs the application. The application only has access to around ~500 or so megabytes of memory. Yet if i run the application manually myself, it runs fine. Is there some sort of limiting factor on the system command and memory? EDIT Okay to elaborate more. We have an automatic processing system, that basically takes an input file and runs a bunch of applications on it. This has worked fine for the last 12 years or so. But now we are dealing with larger and larger images(Remote Sensing) using ArcEngine (ESRI Image Manipulation). Now we basically have the following: Executes a set of predefined tasks one after another by calling system(). Now when it comes to the ESRI Application the system the program crashes when attempting to read the image into memory. I cannot do anything about this by partially reading the image file, because this is how their sdk works. Also i just did a test by creating a veru simple C program that forcefullies allocates memory and seeing when it crashes. It crashes almost exactly around 512MB. I've looked around on the internet and cannot find anything. =/... EDIT 2 I just did some funky tests. I basically wrote a small C program that calls the application via system(). And called that, it crashes in the exact same place. When i called this program the system had 2.5GB free memory(out of 3). I then basically wrote a python script that uses subprocess and popen and it worked fine. Adding the python script to the automatic processing system also runs fine. What could possibly be doing this? EDIT 3 Python script and the processing system both run as the same user. The only difference is the processing system runs as a service, logged in as a user.",['system()'],False
3243902,Asynchronous processing or message queues in PHP (CakePHP),"I am building a website in CakePHP that processes files uploaded though an XML-RPC API and though a web frontend. Files need to be scanned by ClamAV, thumbnails need to be generated, etcetera. All resource intensive work that takes some time for which the user should not have to wait. So, I am looking into asynchronous processing with PHP in general and CakePHP in particular. I came across the MultiTask plugin for CakePHP that looks promising. I also came across various message queue implementations such as dropr and beanstalkd. Of course, I will also need some kind of background process, probably implemented using a Cake Shell of some kind. I saw MultiTask using PHP_Fork to implement a multithreaded PHP daemon. I need some advice on how to fit all these pieces together in the best way. Is it a good idea to have a long-running daemon written in PHP? What should I watch out for? What are the advantage of external message queue implementations? The MultiTask plugin does not use an external message queue. It rolls it's own using a MySQL table to store tasks. What message queue should I use? dropr? beanstalkd? Something else? How should I implement the backend processor? Is a forking PHP daemon a good idea or just asking for trouble? My current plan is either to use the MultiTask plugin or to edit it to use beanstald instead of it's own MySQL table implementation. Jobs in the queue can simply consist of a task name and an array of parameters. The PHP daemon would watch for incoming jobs and pass them out to one of it's child threads. The would simply execute the CakePHP Task with the given parameters. Any opinion, advice, comments, gotchas or flames on this?",[],False

3265944,Extremely Difficult Problem with ASP.Net 4.0 WebForms app using Routing,"I have a completed app running in a QA environment. Everything works fine under most circumstances. If you hit a plain URL (no identifying information in the URL), you see an intro page with a button (generated by an asp LinkButton control) that posts back and directs you to another page.

When such a URL is followed from, e.g., Word and the default browser is IE, the intro page loads fine, but clicking the button causes an error. When not debugging, this behavior occurs every time. While debugging, the error occurs only ~ 1 in 10 times (closing the browser instance and starting over every time). When the error occurs, the intro page Page_Load fires and IsPostBack is false. Somehow, instead of a post, a get is being issued. When I run fiddler to try to analyze the actual calls (can't use firebug because it never happens using Firefox), everything works every time. I don't know whether this issue has anything to do with routing, and I've no idea even what to look at next. The strange thing is, when I debug, the intro page doesn't fully load every time. Only about 1 in 3 times does it fully load even if I've just cleared browser cache. When I run it through fiddler, it fully loads and works fine every time.",[],False

Each new client connection spawns a new thread from which it can then perform multiple operations, specifically lookups or inserts. lookups can be conducted in parallel.

You could say that lookup operations could be done without spawning a new thread for the client, however they can take a while causing the server to lock, dropping new requests.

I'm not sure how to call this, so if anyone finds a more appropriate title, please do edit. Background I'm making this application for searching bus transit lines. Bus lines are a 3 digit number, and is unique and will never change. The requirement is to be able to search for lines from stop A to stop B. The user interface is already successful in hinting the user to only use valid stop names. The requirement is to be able to display if a route has a direct line, and if not, display a 2-line and even 3-line combination. Example: I need to get from point A to point D. The program should show: If there's a direct line A-D. If not, display alternative, 2 line combos, such as A-C, C-D. If there aren't any 2-line combos, search for 3-line combos: A-B, B-C, C-D. Of course, the app should display bus line numbers, as well as when to switch buses. What I have: My database is structured as follows (simplified, actual database includes locations and times and whatnot): Where describe a many-to-many relationship between the bus lines and the stops. Order, signifies the order in which stops appear in a single line. Not all lines go back and forth, and order has meaning (point A with order 2 comes after point B with order 1). The Problem We find out if a line can pass through the route easily enough. Just search for a single line which passes through both points in the correct order. How can I find if there's a 2/3 line combo? I was thinking to search for a line which matches the source stop, and one for the destination stop, and see if I can get a common stop between them, where the user can switch buses. How do I remember that stop? 3 line combo is even trickier, I find a line for the source, and a line for the destination, and then what? Search for a line which has 2 stops I guess, but again, How do I remember the stops? tl;dr How do I remember results from a query to be able to use it again? I'm hoping to achieve this in a single query (for each, a query for 1-line routes, a query for 2, and a query for 3-line combos).

I would like the ViewPager to switch pages when I swipe across the screen. The problem is that swipes are not detected when they are made across the GridView.

While fiddling with the source code, I did this to a custom class extended from GridView: -- where refers to the ViewPager class.

We were considering Qt as the UI framework but found out that Qt is a lot more than that (we are not familiar with Qt). In general, the device needs to do the following: 1. Receive measurements over USB HID from another device (USB HID is used for convenience). 2. Process the measurements. 3. Store them in a database. 4. Interact with the user using the device's touch screen lcd. 5. Communicate (wi-fi, tcp-ip) with a central management station that collects the data and configures the device. 6. Include a web server to allow accessing the device via a browser. We intend to program in C++. My questions are: 1. Is that a good choice for such a device? 2. Assuming we choose Qt, how do we build our product? - Do we use Qt just as a GUI framework and write the application code in a separate process (passing messages between Qt and the application process)? - Do we write the entire application inside Qt, using all of the services the tool has to offer? - Another approach?",[],False

3517719,Atomic UPSERT in SQL Server 2005,"What is the correct pattern for doing an atomic ""UPSERT"" (UPDATE where exists, INSERT otherwise) in SQL Server 2005? I see a lot of code on SO (e.g. see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/639854/tsql-check-if-a-row-exists-otherwise-insert) with the following two-part pattern: or will be an evaluation of natural keys. None of the above approaches seem to deal well with concurrency. If I cannot have two rows with the same natural key, it seems like all of the above risk inserting rows with the same natural keys in race condition scenarios. I have been using the following approach but I'm surprised not to see it anywhere in people's responses so I'm wondering what is wrong with it: Note that the race condition mentioned here is a different one from the ones in the earlier code. In the earlier code, the issue was phantom reads (rows being inserted between the UPDATE/IF or between the SELECT/INSERT by another session). In the above code, the race condition has to do with DELETEs. Is it possible for a matching row to be deleted by another session AFTER the (WHERE NOT EXISTS) executes but before the INSERT executes? It's not clear where the WHERE NOT EXISTS puts a lock on anything in conjunction with the UPDATE. Is this atomic? I can't locate where this would be documented in SQL Server documentation. EDIT: I realise this could be done with transactions, but I think I would need to set the transaction level to SERIALIZABLE to avoid the phantom read problem? Surely that is overkill for such a common problem?","['UPDATE ...\nFROM ...\nWHERE &lt;condition&gt;\n-- race condition risk here\nIF @@ROWCOUNT = 0\n  INSERT ...\n', 'IF (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ...

3567365,PHP - Proper way to extend class,"I am currently working on a mini 'framework' and I am having some difficulties. I'm attempting this in order to strengthen my understanding of basic concepts utilized in most MVC's (At least from what I have seen). So yes, I do understand that using a framework may be easier and not everything that I am doing is ideal. I am just trying to learn more. So I have 2 files that I am currently working with. FrontController.php /application/BaseController.php So what I would like to be able to do is extend the BaseController with the FrontController. I figured that extending the BaseController would allow me to add common functionality to my entire application. The problem is that I am not certain how to do this properly. I know that I need to 'require' BaseController.php into FrontController.php somehow, but I have seen many different ways and I want to know which is most correct. What I have tried is simply adding 'require_once(""/application/BaseController.php"");' to the top of FrontController.php and then extending the FrontController class, but this isn't working (blank page), and from what I have read, it is not the best way. I read into __autoload() but I do not understand how to use it effectively. Do I just put this at the top of my FrontController.php file and extend my class after that? So, to summarize, I would like to extend my FrontController class (and other future classes, when necessary) with my BaseController. I would just like some advice for how to accomplish this task effectively. It may even be possible that the way I have this thought out is ass backwards, and if that is the case, please let me know!!","['&lt;?php   \nclass FrontController {\n    public function __construct() {\n        $this-&gt;go(); // RUNS GO FUNCTION UPON LOADING\n    }\n\n    public function go() {          \n        $url = $_SERVER[\'REQUEST_URI\']; // GRABS URL\n        $action = explode(""/"", $url); // SPLITS UP URL INTO SECTIONS\n\n        $object = ucfirst($action[2]) .

3594889,How do you verify a restore?,"What tool(s) would you use to verify that a restored file structure is whole and complete? My environment is a Windows Server 2008 file server. (We use tape for backup, but that is inconsequential.) I am specifically looking for a tool that will: Record the names of all files and folders below a specified directory Optionally calculate checksums of each file encountered Save this index in a human-readable format Compare the index against restored data and show differences Some background: I recently had to replace the disks in our file server. The upgrade was scheduled to start 36 hours after the most recent full backup, so I created a differential backup. However, it turns out that one of our applications was clearing the archive bit on files saved to the server, so these were not included in the differential backup. I was unaware of this until my users reported some files as missing. Aside from this, are there any other common methods for validating the integrity completeness of a restore? I am frequently told that testing backups by restoring them is the only way to know that backups are working, but how do you deal with the case where it works 99% correctly and the other 1% silently fails? Update: Apparently I need to clarify a few things. I do already use full backups when possible, but sometimes the situation calls for a differential backup. When that happens, I need to verify that every file in the original data is also in the restored data. I am already using the ""verify"" feature in Backup Exec, but that only ensures that everything written to tape can be read back again. I do conduct occasional spot-check restores to ensure that the backup media is intact. I am already familiar with the common wisdom that ""the best way to test a backup is to restore it."" This is a necessary step, but it is NOT sufficient. Being able to restore the files you backed up does NOT guarantee that all the files you need were backed up in the first place. That is the problem I need solved.",[],True

3609082,Is it OK to have multiple NSManagedObjectContext instances per thread?,"You have to have one per thread, but beyond that ... should you have more? Is it harmful to have more? For instance, I'm tempted to build my app around having one NSManagedObjectContext per tab, handling the subset of the overall persistent store that appears on that particular tab.

(NB: not using NSFetchController because of the major bugs in that class pre iOS 3.2, and this is a 3.0+ app) Have I misunderstood how to use NSManagedObjectContext? If so, can anyone point out ""good""/""bad"" reasons for using additional NSManagedObjectContext instances?

I recently put in a new Win2008R2 member server. Followed all the guides to DCPromo it and took all the FMSO roles from the 2003DC to the 2008R2 DC. Everything seemed to go well. Last night I was going through the GPO's - since we currently just use an old bat file login script, when I noticed I couldn't create or edit anything in teh GPO manager. I kept getting 'file not found' errors. 3 minutes of investigation showed that the 2008R2 DC does not have any Sysvol or Netlogon folders that it should have got with I DCPromo'd it, and that its not replicating that info from the 2003DC.

3680598,What is the best way to add a configuration UI to my Android application?,"I have a simple Android application that loads a page in a WebView, then most of the real work is done by the server-side scripts. Everything is working great, except that I currently have the page URL hard-coded in the Android application, sort of like this: This was fine until this morning when I was asked to to make it so that the user is prompted to enter the URL the first time the application run, and the URL that is entered by the user is then saved and used automatically by the application from that point onward. I was also asked to make it so that the user can change the URL if they choose to do so. The reason I was asked to do this is so that users can install the server side of the application on their own servers and my Android application will be able to connect without me having to write a custom version for each user, with their URL hard-coded into the application. I am unsure what is the best way to handle this in Android. It seems that I probably need to add some type of configuration interface to the application that is shown by default on the first run, then only when the Menu button is pressed on the following runs. From this configuration interface I guess I would then get the URL from the user and serialize it for future use. I'm just guessing here. I really don't know how to best accomplish this in Android, and that is my question. What is the best way to accomplish this?

3703771,Combinatorics Homework Problem: $n$ People Sit Down. What is the Probability that $m$ Seats are Occupied?,"From Y.A. Rozanov. Probability Theory: A Concise Course: Chapter 1. Problem 6. Suppose $n$ people sit down at random and independently of each other in an auditorium containing $n+k$ seats. What is the probability that m seats specified in advance $(m \le n)$ will be occupied? My Solution: First, there are $ n+k \choose n $ ways to choose n seats from n+k seats. That is the denominator. What I want to find is the number of ways the m seats can be occupied by n people where there are more people than m and n+k total seats. I start by thinking of the m seats as baskets that can be filled with n balls. What is the number of ways to fill m baskets with n balls? The first basket can be filled n different ways. The second basket can be filled n-1 different ways. The mths basket can be filled n-m+1 different ways. Therefore, by the usual rule for sampling without replacement, all the m baskets can be filled $\frac{n!}{m!*(n-m)!)}$ different ways. But the other n+k-m baskets (these are the ""seats"" leftover from the n+k total after m have been selected) can be filled also. The question now is, how many ways can these be filled given that that all the m seats are filled? There are n-m left over balls. And there are n+k-m left over baskets. So I believe these can be filled $n+k-m \choose n-m$ ways. So my answer is: $\frac{\frac{n!}{m!*(n-m)!)}{n+k-m \choose n-m}}{ n+k \choose n }$ I'm not confidant in this answer. :( Sorry that I re-expressed it in terms of baskets instead of seats, but that makes it easier for me to think about.",[],False

but g ] not works sometimes: the error info is E257: cstag: tag not found Edit 2: content of .vimrc","['[mirror@home libevent]$ ls\narc4random.c            bufferevent_sock.c     epoll.c                event_tagging.c      evutil.c           l                        Makefile.am         strlcpy-internal.h\nautogen.sh              buffer_iocp.c          epoll_sub.c            evmap.c              evutil_rand.c      libevent_openssl.pc.in   Makefile.nmake      test\nb                       changelist-internal.h  evbuffer-internal.h    evmap-internal.h     evutil_time.c      libevent.pc.in           minheap-internal.h  time-internal.h\nbuffer.c                ChangeLog              evconfig-private.h.in  evport.c             ht-internal.h      libevent_pthreads.pc.in  mm-internal.h       util-internal.h\nbufferevent_async.c     ChangeLog-1.4          evdns.3                evrpc.c              http.c             LICENSE                  poll.c              whatsnew-2.0.txt\nbufferevent.c           ChangeLog-2.0          evdns.c                evrpc-internal.h     http-internal.h    listener.c               ratelim-internal.h  whatsnew-2.1.txt\nbufferevent_filter.c    compat                 event.3                evsignal-internal.h  include            log.c                    README              WIN32-Code\nbufferevent-internal.h  configure.in           event.c                evthread.c           iocp-internal.h    log-internal.h           sample              win32select.c\nbufferevent_openssl.c   defer-internal.h       event-internal.h       evthread-internal.h  ipv6-internal.h    m4                       select.c\nbufferevent_pair.c      devpoll.c              event_iocp.c           evthread_pthread.c   kqueue.c           make_epoll_table.py      signal.c\nbufferevent_ratelim.c   Doxyfile               event_rpcgen.py        evthread_win32.c     kqueue-internal.h  make-event-config.sed    strlcpy.c\n', '[mirror@home libevent]$ ls test/\nbench.c              Makefile.am            regress_dns.c   regress_listener.c  regress_ssl.c        regress_zlib.c     test-fdleak.c    test-time.c      tinytest_local.h\nbench_cascade.c      Makefile.nmake         regress_et.c    regress_main.c      regress_testutils.c  rpcgen_wrapper.sh  test-init.c      test-weof.c      tinytest_macros.h\nbench_http.c         regress_buffer.c       regress.h       regress_minheap.c   regress_testutils.h  test-changelist.c  test-ratelim.c   tinytest.c\nbench_httpclient.c   regress_bufferevent.c  regress_http.c  regress.rpc         regress_thread.c     test-dumpevents.c  test-ratelim.sh  tinytest_demo.c\ncheck-dumpevents.py  regress.c              regress_iocp.c  regress_rpc.c       regress_util.c       test-eof.c         test.sh   \n', '[mirror@home libevent]$ find test/ -regex .*.c -exec grep main {} +\ntest/regress.c:struct testcase_t main_testcases[] = {\ntest/test-weof.c:main(int argc, char **argv)\ntest/regress_dns.c:/* FIXME: We should move this to regress_main.c if anything else needs it.*/\ntest/regress_buffer.c:  size_t remaining;\ntest/regress_buffer.c:  remaining = v[0].iov_len - 512;\ntest/regress_buffer.c:  tt_int_op(remaining, ==, v[0].iov_len);\ntest/regress_buffer.c:  remaining -= 8;\ntest/regress_buffer.c:  n = evbuffer_reserve_space(buf, remaining+64, v, 2);\ntest/regress_buffer.c:  tt_int_op(remaining, ==, v[0].iov_len);\ntest/regress_buffer.c:  remaining -= 1;\ntest/regress_buffer.c:  n = evbuffer_reserve_space(buf, remaining+64, v, 2);\ntest/regress_buffer.c:  tt_int_op(remaining, ==, v[0].iov_len);\ntest/regress_buffer.c:  /* Drain some of the remaining chunk, then add it to another buffer */\ntest/regress_main.c:    { ""main/"", main_testcases },\ntest/regress_main.c:main(int argc, const char **argv)\ntest/regress_main.c:    if (tinytest_main(argc,argv,testgroups))\ntest/tinytest.c:static int in_tinytest_main = 0; /**&lt; true if we\'re in tinytest_main().*/\ntest/tinytest.c:        if (!in_tinytest_main) {\ntest/tinytest.c:                       "" called from within tinytest_main.\\n"");\ntest/tinytest.c:tinytest_main(int c, const char **v, struct testgroup_t *groups)\ntest/tinytest.c:        ++in_tinytest_main;\ntest/tinytest.c:        --in_tinytest_main;\ntest/test-eof.c:main(int argc, char **argv)\ntest/test-ratelim.c:main(int argc, char **argv)\ntest/tinytest_demo.c:main(int c, const char **v)\ntest/tinytest_demo.c:   /* Finally, just call tinytest_main().

So let’s say the API keys are only valid for 30 days and let’s assume keys are going to expire on Nov 30th. So my question is can we renew API keys before Nov 30? or do we have to wait until Nov 30th to renew keys. If yes, how? Also, what does null value for a DOME variable d2l.Security.API.TokenTimeout mean? Does it compute to some default no. of days before keys are expired?",[],False

3777406,Creating a notification from within a notification,"I'm creating an extension for Chrome, and one of the functionalities included is the ability for the end user to add people as contacts. Currently, the contact is saved to the database via AJAX, after which a desktop notification is displayed telling the user that the deed has been done. However, I would want to first ask the user if he's sure he wants to do that. So I got the mad idea of wanting to create a new notification from within a notification. So first, the confirmation HTML notification would be created from the background.html, and displayed. It contains a button, and upon clicking it, it should run the AJAX function and create a second notification, containing the feedback. However, I seem to be unable to do this. I can't run createNotification() from the notification, sendRequest() doesn't seem to go through neither, and I can't use the onClose listener from background.html, because I want to differentiate between clicking the ""Yes"" button and the ""No"" button. Is there any way I can do this? And if not, how should the confirmation dialog be implemented instead?",[],False

3892291,Subsequent HTML5 CreateObjectURL blob image preview and cropping loading bug,"I'm trying to figure out if my code is at fault or the current HTML5 File API implementation. The code below works. The bug appears when repeating the process after already loading the image once. The second time a file is selected the image blob loads, then there's a flicker and the image disappears. Subsequent selections after that usually work fine (sometimes there's erratic behavior if the file is big). Repeating the process for the same file selection generally works (as a fix). Any help would be greatly appreciated. JavaScript libraries used JQuery 1.7.1 JQuery Tools 1.2.6 JCrop 0.9.9 Steps - Summary The user selects a file via the traditional dialog. An onchange handler executes for the input and checks if a file was selected, if so, then verifies that the MIME type is image/jpeg or image/png and that the selected file size is smaller than 250KB. If this validation fails it resets the selection. At this point the file (image) to be uploaded is valid. Next it checks if the browser supports the File API CreateObjectURL via (if it doesn't, skips the next steps) It loads the image blob into the current picture preview (one used to display the current image) and also into a dynamically generated image element which is added into a jquery tools' overlay with jcrop cropping functionality. The user then crops the image via jcrop and closes the overlay, seeing the cropped preview of the image to be uploaded (only if the browser supports CreateObjectURL and the user cropped the image) The Code The HTML The JavaScript window.URL = window.URL || window.webkitURL; Feel free to use the code (my contribution for any help received here). Update I have come across another question on stackoverflow regarding a similar issue (image loading then disappearing) in regards to the use of JCrop. I'm currently betting on JCrop being the culprit. I've also read that when img.onload executes the image isn't always 'ready', hence the strange behavior and additional checks to .actualWidth/.actualHeight with a setTimeout might solve the issue. I'll investigate it.

When the user moves the slider, I'm loading and setting various images as Source of the Image-control. I got quite a few images, varying in size up to a 200 KB, but when I move that slider back and fourth, the program starts to eat quite a lot of memory. Hundreds and hundreds of megs of memory. Most of it gets garbage collected eventyally, but not all. Maybe WPF isn't the way to go or should I force a G/C? I've tried loading the image as Bitmap and getting the bitmap source with and Win32-api's to delete and dispose and so on, but I'm just making things worse :) I guess I should try to grab the existing image source and release it somehow before loading and assigning a new one. Any ideas?

3934623,VB.NET - Visual Foxpro OLE DB Problem with Numeric Decimal Column,"In Short: I'm using VB.NET 2008 to connect to a Visual Foxpro 6 Database using the vfpoledb.1 driver. When I attempt to fill an OleDbDataAdapter with a dataset table that contains one of the numeric columns, I get the following error message: ""The provider could not determine the Decimal value. For example, the row was just created, the default for the Decimal column was not available, and the consumer had not yet set a new Decimal value."" I'd like to retrieve this column from VB.NET 2008 and keep it in a numeric format. The Long Version: I'm using VB.NET to connect to a Visual Foxpro 6 database. Several of the columns in the table are intended for numeric data type of up to 8 digits. I'm not sure how Visual Foxpro data types work but it appears that this field allows someone to enter any of the following example values: From Visual Foxpro: I have access to small program called Foxwin that allows me to browse the VFP tables in a native VFP environment. This is what I'm using to access the data to obtain my examples for what I posted above. From here I can see that some rows contain no values at all in this field although they appear to be filled with spaces when there is no data. I've tried to run update queries to fill in every row with valid data but my update queries finish without updating any rows. I've tried ISNULL(bal_qty) and bal_qty IS NULL and neither one works. From MS Access 2007: Using the same driver that I'm using in VB.NET and I can load the ADO recordset and bind it to a form without a problem.

3988724,Finding the penumbra of a Constraint Satisfaction Problem,"The following question has come up a number of times when testing the security of a system or model. Motivation: Software security flaws often come not from bugs due to valid inputs, but bugs resulting from invalid inputs that are sufficiently close to valid inputs to get past many of the straightforward validity checks. The classic example is of course buffer overflows, where the input is reasonable, except that it is too large. Compilers and other tools can help address these problems by modifying the layout of the stack and heap and by other obfuscation techniques. An alternative is to remove the problems from the source code itself. One technique called fuzzing bombards the program with inputs are close to expected inputs, but are in some places unreasonable (large values for integer or string fields). I would like to understand fuzzing (as one example) from a more formal perspective. Assume that the space of valid inputs is described by constraints $\Phi$. Let $M$ be the set of solutions of such constraints, namely $M=\lbrace m\in\mathcal{M}~|~m\models\Phi\rbrace$, where $\mathcal{M}$ is the space of possible inputs. I'm looking for work describing the following notions: The penumbra of $M$ is a set $M'\subseteq \mathcal{M}$ such that for each $m\in M'$ $m\not\models\Phi$ and in some sense the elements of $M'$ are close to the elements of $M$. One can think of the penumbra as the almost solutions. Of course, this notion will not be unique. Ways of relaxing the constraints $\Phi$ to $\Phi'$ such that firstly $\Phi\Rightarrow\Phi'$ and $\Phi'\land\neg\Phi$ is, in a sense, the syntactic penumbra of $\Phi$. ""Penumbra"" is a word I selected to describe the concept. It may well be called something else. I found inspiration in mathematical morphology, hence my visual metaphor, but the two worlds are parsecs apart. Is there any useful work there? Or perhaps in the world of rough sets? Can anyone shed light?",[],False

The second tip is: this application works perfectly as is expected if I'm running the Visual Studio NOT as administrator, but everytime the command line is executed, the process ask me for security validation on the screen (UAC) Yes, I tried to work with the manifest but I've a lot of problems to compile it. It returns 9009 error sometimes, a lot of kind of errors. So my questions are: 1) There's possible to do that without ask to the user for permissions? The application must be silent. This is the real question. If so... 2) How can I define the manifest for my application runs this command as administrator? I miss anything about? It's the same sign the application? 3) Can My app runs these commands as administrator without running as administrator? This is the perfect scenario, the users that will use this app can't be / can't will be administrators. 4) This will work on XP? XP ask for UAC?

4096190,SQL Query with counting,I am using MS-SQL and I have a table with the following columns: SessionId | Date | first name | last name i would like to do group by sessionId and then get the row with the max date. in additional to that i would like to count the sessionsId. for example: i would like to get the following rows: Thanks.,"['xxx | 21/12/2012 | f1 | l1\nxxx | 20/12/2012 | f2 | l2\nyyy | 21/12/2012 | f3 | l3\nyyy | 20/12/2012 | f4 | l4\n', 'xxx | 21/12/2012 | f1 | l1 | 2\nyyy | 21/12/2012 | f3 | l3 | 2\n']",False
4097133,"Given the pairwise distances between $n$ points, how can I find plausible coordinates for the points?","If I have three points $A, B, C$, and I know the distances between $A$ and $B$, $B$ and $C$, and $A$ and $C$, (1) How can I find (one possible value for) the coordinates of $A$, $B$, and $C$? (2) If the distance function is a viable distance metric, must a solution always exist? (3) How can I generalize this to $n$ points?",[],False
4106414,Inequality involving exponentials,"I have a small doubt and will much appreciate it if someone will clear it up. For large $k$ and $n=\lfloor 2^{k/2}\rfloor $, why are the following inequalities true: $\displaystyle\left(\frac{n}{2^{k/2}}\right)^k\le 1$. $\displaystyle\frac{2^{1+k/2}}{k!}$ is much smaller then 1. Thanks a lot.",[],False
4109785,ProgressBar inside JTable,"I have a problem that I can't solve using JTable with editor and renderer containing JProgressBar inside.

4138319,jQuery scrollTop() doesn't seem to work in Safari or Chrome (Windows),"I've got a simple setup to allow a ""help""-style window to be loaded and scrolled to a particular point on the page. More or less the code looks like this: The target of the scroll and the fudge value are determined by a couple of hints dropped on the page, and I'm having no problems with that part of this mechanism anywhere. In Firefox and IE8, the above code works exactly like I want: the scrolled box (in this case, the page body) correctly scrolls the contained stuff to the right point in the window when it's told to do so. In Chrome and Safari, however, the call to scrollTop() apparently does nothing at all. All the numbers are OK, and the target refers to the right thing (and the offsetParent() is indeed the body element), but nothing at all happens. As far as I can tell from googling around, this is supposed to work. Is there something funny about the renderer under Safari and Chrome? This is jQuery 1.3.2 if that matters.

Consider a swap template function that can swap any type (int, double, struct, etc...)

You will need a different definition, and so you will have to make an Explicit Specialization. There is this statement in the same section:- ""A specialization overrides the regular template, and a non-template function overrides both."" Why not just make a (regular) function for that use? Then a regular/non-template will override the template? If my solution is correct, then what is a good example for Explicit Specialization?",[],False

4160914,Data Annotations and MVC 4,"I did MVC 2 two years ago. I am now using MVC 4 and would like to confirm a few things. 1) In MVC 4, we do not need to create a ModelMetadata class to annotate with data annotations for data validation. We may simply annotate the model classes themselves. In other words, if we are using the EDM generator to generate a model and corresponding classes for us, then we may create a new set of partial classes with the same names and use data annotation attributes on those partial classes themselves. We do not need to create a new type of model metadata class and decorate that class with data annotation/attributes, like here: http://www.asp.net/mvc/tutorials/older-versions/models-%28data%29/validation-with-the-data-annotation-validators-cs 2) For data annotations to work, we need a reference only to System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations and not to Microsoft.Web.Mvc.DataAnnotations. 3) We do not need to instantiate the default model binder in the Application_Start event in the Global.asax file.

4329426,Are Fortran control characters (carriage control) still implemented in compilers?,"In the book Fortran 95/2003 for Scientists and Engineers, there is much talk given to the importance of recognizing that the first column in a format statement is reserved for control characters. I've also seen control characters referred to as carriage control on the internet. To avoid confusion, by control characters, I refer to the characters ""1, a blank (i.e. \s), 0, and +"" as having an effect on the vertical spacing of output when placed in the first column (character) of a FORMAT statement. Also, see this text-only web page written entirely in fixed-width typeface : Fortran carriage-control (because nothing screams accuracy and antiquity better than prose in monospaced font). I found this page and others like it to be not quite clear. According to Fortran 95/2003 for Scientists and Engineers, failure to recall that the first column is reserved for carriage control can lead to horrible unintended output.

4357948,Unable to optimize MySQL query which uses a ORDER BY clause,"I'm using Drupal 6 with MySQL version 5.0.95 and at an impasse where one of my queries which displays content based on most recent article date slows down and because of the frequency of being used kills the site performance altogether. The query in question is as below: The EXPLAIN of the query shows the below result: This query seemed relatively simple and straight forward and retrieves articles which belong to a category (term) 153 and are of status 1 (published). But apparently Using temporary table and Using filesort means the query is bound to fail from what I've learnt browsing about it. Removing field_article_date_format_value from the ORDER BY clause solves the Using temporary; Using filesort reduces the query execution time but is required and cannot be traded off, unfortunately same holds equally true for the site performance. My hunch is that most of the trouble comes from the term_node table which maps articles to categories and is a many-many relationship table meaning if article X is associated to 5 categories C1....C5 it will have 5 entries in that table, this table is from out-of-the-box drupal. Dealing with heavy DB content is something new to me and going through some of the similar queries ( When ordering by date desc, &quot;Using temporary&quot; slows down query, MySQL performance optimization: order by datetime field) I tried to create a composite index for the content_type_article whose datetime field is used in the ORDER BY clause along with another key (nid) in it and tried to FORCE INDEX.

However, if I refresh the page, the error may or may not appear on any given page load. Sometimes, it works; sometimes, the browser throws runtime errors when loading the page or when I mouse over the ASP Menu control.

4474067,Using MATLAB to process files in real-time after every instance a file is created by a separate program,"I am using MATLAB to process image files that are created by a camera and stored in a directory on Windows. I am trying to incorporate feedback into control of the camera and therefore require MATLAB to process an image every time a new image is created and appears in the directory. I have never created a MATLAB program that runs continuously and waits for an event to occur. From what I've read online it appears my best option is to use a timer object and have the MATLAB program read the contents of the directory repeatedly. Is this a good approach or are there alternative approaches I can implement? I'm wondering if there is a way the MATLAB program can be ""triggered"" by the appearance of a file in a directory as opposed to constantly surveying the contents of this directory. I hope there is because as the directory fills up I find that the ""dir"" command in MATLAB is really slow; slow enough that I may not be able to process images as fast as I require. As a follow up. Are there any recommendations about how to deploy this program? An idea I like is a simple GUI with a ""start"" and ""stop"" button. Thank you.",[],False

4521121,How do I dispose of a VB6 COM object i'm using via an interop assembly from IronPython?,"I'm using a third party COM component by means of a .NET interop assembly in IronPython, as seen here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1237200/how-can-i-use-a-vb6-com-reference-in-ironpython My experience in this area has been great, I'm very impressed by the amount of stuff that works seamlessly... except one thing. The 3rd party COM component uses Microsoft's DAO library (not sure what version) to work with a database created by yet another 3rd party application. The problem is that this database file gets recreated during my program's runtime, and I'd like to 'de-initialize' this COM object. In particular, running my code (which accesses the COM component's attributes, calls it's methods, etc) works fine the first time I run my routine. The next time, however, the third party COM component displays a messagebox saying the database (MSAccess 95 .mdb file) is already in use, and offers an option to retry. Pressing retry works reliably, so the main issue is that this dialog comes up. So, my theory is the COM component is leaking handles to the db, and I can't find a 'cleanup' method to call. I've tried , but that has not worked. My last resort is making the code that calls to the COM object a separate IronPython process that interacts with my main process via std in/out as the role the COM object serves is more of a 'give me all this information right now' use case instead of a continually required dependency. I am hoping to avoid that scenario, and since i'm not to familiar with COM (or really, .NET for that matter) I can only hope i'm missing an obvious method or the like. If there's no clean way, can I forcibly unload the assembly from my process, analogous to repeated calls in native code? (I guarantee that my code won't be using the object anymore, so I shouldn't need to worry about missing refs on my part leading to a memory protection error) EDIT: I wasn't able to solve this, so I went the out of process method and let windows clean up when my child batch process shuts down.","['.Dispose()', '.Dispose', 'FreeLibrary']",False

The docs say ""continues with the next cycle of the nearest enclosing loop"", fine, but if one is not executed, shouldn't processing should proceed to the next statement?

I am able to compile helloworld, telling the linker to look for libmylib.so. The ""strange"" facts are: libmylib.so is not merged with libhelloworld.so, so i have to copy libmylib.so into the directory helloworld/libs/armeabi manually in the java code, i have to load explicitly mylib with System.loadLibrary and i have to load mylib BEFORE i load helloworld library (that is: ), otherwise the app crashes. If i do 1 and 2, the app works perfectly (tested both on the emulator and on a real device).

The Android.mk of mylib is: If i use BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY, i got libmylib.so as usual. If i use, instead, BUILD_STATIC_LIBRARY, no .so or .a is generated by ndk-build.

4625110,iPhone App: Making a webpage accessible only to people using a specific app,"I was just wondering if it is possible and if so what the best way to create a web-page that is only accessible from a custom iPhone application? For example, if you tried to access the webpage from the iPhone's built in browser, or any other browser it would display an error page but when accessed from a custom built application it would be fully functional. One idea that has come up is to change the User-Agent string in the embedded browser inside the application to something custom. I'm not sure if this is viable though. I hope this makes sense. Thanks in advance. -Ben",[],False
4629196,"Is there a standard, documented, development pattern to create UI layouts similar to iTunes, iCal, iPhoto, etc?","I am new to Cocoa development and I am trying to create UI layouts using what I consider to be the ""standard"" layout that is shared by apps like iTunes, iCal, iPhoto, Billings, 1Password, Numbers, Delicious Library, etcetera. This typical layout can be described as follows: A ""Library"" panel on the left side of the screen, usually meant for discovering hierarchies. This panel usually covers about a fourth of the horizontal space. A ""Main"" panel to the right of the Library panel on which most of the UI interactions take place. This takes the remaining horizontal space and is where we find things like the monthly calendar view in iCal, or the tile of album art and playlists in iTunes. Some ""Utility"" panel on the bottom-left corner of the screen, usually for things like additional options. Is there a documented pattern that will show best practices on how to ""wire"" the View and Controller classes for these types of layouts? For instances, how many ViewControllers to use, whether or not using an NSDocument-based approach makes sense, some common pitfalls, etcetera? This layout is so prevalent, that I am surprised that there doesn't seem to be any good reference on it. Update: I forgot to mention that I have access to the Apple Developer site, and while I can find the library reference for the different classes in Cocoa, I cannot seem to find a good reference for how to bring it all together in the layout I describe. Books like Aaron Hillegass' and others out there are great to learn the basics on Cocoa and creating simple interfaces (a few controls laid out on an view connected to an NSDocument), but not so great at guiding you to the UI layout I describe.

4661802,Can Heroku add-on configs change randomly in the cloud?,"Being new to Heroku, I'm a bit confused with add-ons myself. This Heroku blog post from about a year ago cites using add-ons' environment variables as a best practice: Your app reads config for backing services such as the database, memcached, or the outgoing SMTP server from environment variables (e.g. ), rather than hardcoded constants or config files. This allows the platform to easily connect add-on resources (when you run ) without needing to touch your code. I'm indeed using environment variables (via Heroku config), but in one case, I'm using my own vars instead of the default one that gets added by an add-on. (Specifically, I prefer to use e.g. , , etc. for my Redis cache over Heroku's . It feels both more precise/modular and more generic -- esp. when I use a local instance of Redis, not RedisToGo, during development.) I'm wondering, is that a bad practice? Could add-on configs like change randomly in the cloud?","['DATABASE_URL', 'heroku addons:add', 'CACHE_HOST', 'CACHE_PORT', 'REDISTOGO_URL', 'REDISTOGO_URL']",False

4730242,Mac OS X duplex printing problem: one- vs. multi-paged documents,"I like to print on pre-printed stationery using the Preview.app and a duplex-capable HP Color Laserjet 4700 (PostScript) printer. The print dialog handles one and two-paged documents differently: the paper needs to be placed differently into the tray if the document contains one page versus when it contains two pages. This is not obvious when printing on plain paper but becomes obvious when front and reverse side of sheets are marked. Otherwise the first page would end up on the reverse side of the first sheet. I believe the problem is caused by the printer driver setting duplex printing to false (using the PostScript setpagedevice operator) when emitting a single-page document versus keeping it set to true when emitting multi-page documents. All this despite that duplex printing is always specified in the printer dialog. When printing a single-sided document, duplex=true and duplex=false seem to make a difference with respect which side of a sheet gets printed on. It would be also helpful if others could confirm the problem actually exists. I suspect this problem is not limited to specific printers.

4934022,Why are dashes preferred for CSS selectors / HTML attributes?,"In the past I've always used underscores for defining class and id attributes in HTML. Over the last few years I changed over to dashes, mostly to align myself with the trend in the community, not necessarily because it made sense to me. I've always thought dashes have more drawbacks, and I don't see the benefits: Code completion &amp; Editing Most editors treat dashes as word separators, so I can't tab through to the symbol I want. Say the class is """", I have to auto-complete """", enter a hyphen, and complete """". With underscores """" is treated as one word, so it can be filled in one step. The same applies to navigating through the document. Jumping by words or double-clicking on class names is broken by hyphens. (More generally, I think of classes and ids as tokens, so it doesn't make sense to me that a token should be so easily splittable on hyphens.) Ambiguity with arithmetic operator Using dashes breaks object-property access to form elements in JavaScript. This is only possible with underscores: (Admittedly I don't access form elements this way myself, but when deciding on dashes vs underscores as a universal rule, consider that someone might.) Languages like Sass (especially throughout the Compass framework) have settled on dashes as a standard, even for variable names. They originally used underscores in the beginning too. The fact that this is parsed differently strikes me as odd: Inconsistency with variable naming across languages Back in the day, I used to write for variables in PHP, ruby, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. This was convenient and consistent, but again in order to ""fit in"" I now use: dash-case in HTML/CSS camelCase in JavaScript underscore_case in PHP and ruby This doesn't really bother me too much, but I wonder why these became so misaligned, seemingly on purpose. At least with underscores it was possible to maintain consistency: The differences create situations where we have to translate strings unnecessarily, along with the potential for bugs. So I ask: Why did the community almost universally settle on dashes, and are there any reasons that outweigh underscores? There is a related question from back around the time this started, but I'm of the opinion that it's not (or shouldn't have been) just a matter of taste. I'd like to understand why we all settled on this convention if it really was just a matter of taste.","['featured-product', 'featured', 'product', 'featured_product', ""form.first_name.value='Stormageddon';\n"", '$list-item-10\n$list-item - 10\n', 'underscored_names', ""var featured_product = $('#featured_product'); // instead of\nvar featuredProduct = $('#featured-product');\n""]",False

This is a problem when you have records depending on other records in other tables, so you have to disable foreign key constraints during your tests... which actually sucks because these foreign key constraints will get fired in production while your tests won't be aware of them! 2) They seem hellbent on forcing you to use an xml namespace to define your xml... and I honestly can't be bothered to do this. I like the data.xml without any namespace. It works. But they are so hellbent on deprecating it. 3) Creating different xml files is hard on a per test basis, so it actually encourages creating data for your entire app. Unfortunately, this process is a little bloated too once the data grows in size and things get inter tangled. There has got to be a better way to split up your test data into chunks without having to copy/paste a lot of the test data across all of your tests. 4) Keeping track of id references in a big xml file is just impossible.

4995390,Individual Authenticator (Daemon) for Apache Wildcard-VHosts,"In our development environment we're using the following VHost-Configuration for the majority of our projects: With this dynamic vhost configuration we don't need to add a vhost config for each project. My goal is to set a semi automatic basic access authentication for these dynamic vhost. For example: Project A has no specific useraccounts so take the default account (eg. User / Password) Project B has a specific useraccount to take this specific account to be required for login This should happen without the need to change the apache configuration 1) My first attempt was to compile mod_authnz_external as an apache module to pass the authentication data to an external script which could check the provided useraccount data against a postgresql database. This setup worked but is really slow because the external script is instantiated for every http-request. I know that there are several apache modules out there to pass the authentication data to the database directly but with this solution I can't specify default accounts or fallbacks for specific projects 2) My second attempt is more a compromise than the ideal solution. But, apart from that, I don't know how to accomplish this (in pseudo code): But because there is no IfFileExists directive on the one hand and no possibility to use the dynamic VHost wildcard in this context on the other hand I don't know if and how this is possible? 3) I think the ideal solution is if apache would passes the given authentication data from the user to a small socket daemon and builds a small cache where is stores the return value for several minutes. The author of mod_authnz_external already thought about it but there is now implementation at this moment. So I wonder if anyone of you has some input for me?

5125472,Bulk file upload creates multiple versions of all files except last file,"I have an interesting (well to me anyways) problem here. I am doing a code based mass upload of documents into a SharePoint library with a twist. The twist is that the file's last modified date needs to be maintained in the item properties after the upload. The file details are determined from a csv file that contains the path and the metatdata that needs to be attached to the library items as the library is based on a custom content type with metadata fields. The problem I am having is that the modified date is only being maintained with the last file uploaded. All other files indicate the upload time. I did a little more digging and turned on version control. It turns out that files that I have uploaded are being modified multiple times as they have multiple minor versions applied to them, while the final file being uploaded has only one. For example. I am uploading 6 files to test out the process. The last file that is uploaded is sitting at version .1, the other files range from version .6 to .8 to .12.

5168931,Scott's trick without the Axiom of Regularity,"Scott's trick is a method for constructing a set as a subset of a proper class. Specifically, let $A$ be a class (proper or otherwise), and let $$S(A)=\{x\in A:\forall y\in A,\operatorname{rank}(x)\le\operatorname{rank}(y)\}.$$ Then $S:\overline V\to V$ (where $\overline V$ represents the collection of all classes, a concept that cannot be formalized in ZF) satisfies three important properties: (1) $S(A)\subseteq A$, (2) $S(A)$ is a set, even if $A$ is not, and (3) $S(A)=\emptyset$ iff $A=\emptyset$. I would like to generalize this construction to produce another function on $\overline V$ which satisfies the same properties, but does not require the Axiom of Regularity. The place where Regularity appears in the standard Scott's trick is in the proof of property (2), because assuming the negation of Regularity, there is a set $z$ with no rank, and a proper class of sets built from this set (say $z, \{z\}, \{\{z\}\}, \dots$ and continued by transfinite recursion), that also have no rank. Under the conventional definition of rank, $\operatorname{rank}(x)=\emptyset$ whenever $x$ has no rank, so if I take $A$ to be the class of sets containing $z$ described above, then all members of $A$ have the same rank, and thus $S(A)=A$ is also a proper class. My question is if there is any way to construct a similar type of function that works even in such cases. Is it necessary to have a total order on all sets like $\operatorname{rank}$ in order for any such trickery to work? If so, I would guess that there is no way to do it without Regularity.",[],False

But when the code is using session_start(), it always creates new, totally empty session. Code in question below. When this script is executed, in every reload new session is created. But only the one of those sessions has any data inside it, and is used by application. Output in browser is always same: , which is id in browser’s cookie and session id in /tmp that has data populated to it. What could be cause of this behaviour? Those empty files aren’t exactly huge problem, but they do make /tmp (or session dir) quite populated for no reason. EDIT 1: Looks like this is server related problem, since it works for some people. My configuration is Gentoo Linux (32 bit) with Apache and PHP 5.3.6. If I force it to create new session (like removing my own cookie), it creates two session files instead of one. If it reuses old one, it creates “only” one. EDIT 2: Session configuration, as requested (all config rows with ): EDIT 3: Even more strangely, I tried to use sessions from CLI. There, where no session cookies are set, it always created one new session. When setting fixed session value with stopped new session creation altogether and used old session instead. This behaviour is identical with Apache, so I’m starting to suspect this is bug in PHP. No new sessions created if name specially set with , and session correctly used. Even more absurdly, when I took phpsessid from and set that to session_id(), it started to create new (useless empty ones) sessions again. EDIT 4: Since I didn’t write it enough clearly: simply having as single argument causes this problem to happen, it is not specific to my code.","['header(\'Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\');\n\n$main_domain = $_SERVER[""HTTP_HOST""];\n$expld = explode(\'.\', $main_domain);\n\nif(count($expld) &gt; 2) {\n   $tld = array_pop($expld);\n   $domain = array_pop($expld);\n   $main_domain = $domain .

5316312,"HTML5 navigation, structure and semantics","I've been asking a lot of questions lately, but hopefully this will be the last one for a while. I've put up an example at: http://myhideout.eu/menu/ Basically it's all about the menu for my new site, the structural design which is a bit different than what you usually see, semantics and all such thing Basically it consist of a number of tabs, which are not actual links, though they could be. Below is a predefined area which will serve one of two purposes. Assuming that the use is not browsing the menu, the area will be used for something not related to navigation. For example displaying a banner image. Defined as main content. When the menu is in use, this main content will not be displayed. The area will instead be used for the sub menus. I should think that is simple enough, and assuming there's no serious browser compatibility issues with newer browsers, which at this time do not include ie8 and older. I may chose to support ie8, all in good time, b8ut in reality that will be more about supporting windows xp. Now that is all well an good, and it works, but there are some questions that I'd like answered and some issue I should like solved. First of all, if I can avoid using divs, I'd like to. If there's another element that is more suited, please let me know. Secondly, it quickly gets confusing with all the :hover and what not. The CSS as it is, is a mess, and all suggestions will be most welcome. Thirdly I've found, regarding the defined width of the li elements displayed as table-cells, that they act rather weird. If I set a width of 100%, the first cell will be made as wide as possible, while still displaying the others, but if I set an absolute pixel value that is too high, it all lines up perfectly. This is actually rather nice I think, which is why the width is currently set equal to the width of the navigation area, but is this a good approach and can I expect it to work in other never browsers, also in the future? Or is it better to just calculate the appropriate width? Lastly, the main div, which is shown while the navigation isn't used, is not actually related to the navigation, but I haven't figured out how to do it without placing that element in the element. Comments on this will also be appreciated. There are probably issues which I haven't noticed or questions I've forgotten to pose, so again, any comments are very welcome. I do hope to get some hight quality feedback here, and I expect I will ;) So that's it for now. Thanks in advance and best regards. Edit: Taking some of your advice and thinking a bit, I've altered the structure a bit: http://jsfiddle.net/hJuym/39/ I still haven't found a better alternative to display: table-cell No matter what I end up with weird margins/paddings or untidy borders. EDIT2: I have now tried everything I can imagine, but am still unable to fix one tiny bitty problem. I'm told that the table-cell attribute is a no go. While that is all well and good, it actually works EXACTLY as I want it too now, using the table-cell display attribute. since table-cell is bad, apparently, I've tried to make it work with inline, which result in an odd top 1.5px padding or margin, which I can't get rid of, but more importantly, I'm unable to set a width on the li elements. Also the border are very hard to manage if you want them to look perfect. where as table-cell simply tread the border between two cells as one, apparently. Then of course I've tried inline-block, which have had the most succes, though I'm forced to to remove certain spaces and line breaks in the html, which is annoying, but still I am unable to set a fixed width, though apparently I should be able to, and still the border are a mess. Of course I've tried messing around with floats to, but that just gives me a headache. So I want 10 tabs. fine, just take the total width and divide by 10. Ya it works, unless you're unable to set width or want to use borders... jabba jabba jabba nit pick. I'm not angry or anything, but I am confused, tired and giving up. Please tell me why I can't just use what actually works, mainly the table-cell attribute, and assuming that there is a good reason, please do explain to me, in detail, what the alternative is, because I don't see it.l example of newest working draft in last edit.

5337960,How does a myopic interpret Wiener's Tauberian?,"I just read about this post on the intuition behind convolution. In Terence Tao's answer convolution is interpreted as the blur of image in near-sighted eyes. In Harald Hanche-Olsen's it is made clearer that such a blur is due to the combining effect of translated images. I wonder whether this interpretation can be carried on to explain Wiener's Tauberian theorem. I mean the following version Suppose $\phi\in\mathcal{L}^{\infty}$, and $K\in\mathcal{L}^{1}$ be such that \begin{equation} lim_{x\to\infty} (\phi*K)(x)=a\hat{K}(0),\end{equation}and \begin{equation} \hat{K}(s)\neq 0\end{equation} for all $s$. Then \begin{equation} lim_{x\to\infty} (\phi*f)(x)=a\hat{f}(0)\end{equation} for all $f\in\mathcal{L}^1$. So the first equation describe the image in a near-sighted eye, and the last one says something about blurred image in other myopic eyes.

5400949,Encoding unique IDs to a maximum document size of 100kb,"This is going to be a nice little brainbender I think. It is a real life problem, and I am stuck trying to figure out how to implement it. I don't expect it to be a problem for years, and at that point it will be one of those ""nice problems to have"". So, I have documents in my search engine index. The documents can have a number of fields, however, each field size must be limited to only 100kb. I would like to store the IDs, of particular sites which have access to this document. The site id count is low, so it is never going to get up into the extremely high numbers. So example, this document here can be accessed by sites which have an ID of 7 and 10. Now, because the ""access"" field is limited to 100kb, that means that if you were to take consecutive IDs, only unique IDs could be stored. Reference: http://codepad.viper-7.com/Qn4N0K // Output In my application, a particular site, of site ID , tries to search, and he will have access to that ""Some Cool Document"" So now, my question would be, is there any way, that I could some how fit more IDs into that field? I've thought about proper encoding, and applying something like a Huffman Tree, but seeing as each document has different IDs, it would be impossible to apply a single encoding set to every document. Prehaps, I could use something like tokenized roman numerals? Anyway, I'm open to ideas. I should add, that I want to keep all IDs in the same field, for as long as possible. Searching over a second field, will have a considerable performance hit. So I will only switch to using a second access2 field, when I have milked the access field for as long as possible. Edit: Convert to Hex This yields a performance boost of 21353 consecutive IDs. So that is up like 12.8% Important Caveat I think the fact that my fields can only store UTF encoded characters makes it next to impossible to get anything more out of it.","['Document: {\n docId: ""1239""\n text: ""Some Cool Document"",\n access: ""7 10""\n}\n', '18917', '&lt;?php\n    $ids = range(1,18917);\n    $ids = implode("" "", $ids);\n    echo mb_strlen($ids, \'8bit\') / 1024 .

5406569,Getting something out of an old Digi ST-1032,"I'm trying to update a setup of a shipping and packaging unit, that makes use of two Digi ST-1032 'Terminal Server' units. I find it a strange name for the devices, but pre-the-nineties it apparently was the name for a device that offers a number of serial ports over a suitable bundled back-end, in this case SCSI. The friendly people over at http://digi.com informed me they no longer support the device for about a decade, and no Windows XP drivers were written. So for now it looks like I'm stuck with the two (aging) NT4 servers that run the software controlling all the serial barcode-scanners and thermal printers that are connected. What are my options, and what would you do? This is what I can come up with so far: Keep the NT4 servers, just keep developing the software using the same Delphi 6 in use since the start. Try to find out how to connect to the device directly and talk its speak. (I've been peeping around http://ftp1.digi.com but haven't found anything, I did saw some linux support when googling around, though.) Upgrade the server hardware, but install Windows 2000 Server, which should be able to run the NT-drivers. Install a virtual platform (e.g. VMWare) that is capable of patching through the SCSI device to a virtual image running NT4 or AIX or anything that can run the drivers, and use a homebrewn client-server or something like http://com0com.sf.net to patch the serial ports through to a decent server running the software.

5434218,How do I resolve type differences when using an EL Resolver with WELD?,"I have a generic EL producer that I've written to take advantage of WELD's ability to just 'make it work' when I need it done, and even have the type coercion written into the function so that it makes sure the return type matches the weld injection point. Here's my problem: WELD resolves from the injection point's assignable types, ie, if your injection point is a String, it will only look for producers with a String return type. This is problematic, as I want one producer that will take care of the type coercion, and hand back a correctly typed object. As a kludge, I have a String producer method that aliases to the real producer, and only does the type kludging. This... at least works, until I get to the situation of having an Object typed injection point, at which point ALL of my kludge methods AND the generic producer ALL are matched, giving an ambiguous dependency exception, even if I use @Typed on the producers. Is there a sane way around this, or should I give up on this idea of making WELD do all the hard work for me? Here's an example of the use of this producer, from an error handling bean with a Request scope. RequestURI is the one that is troublesome in this case, the other two require typed ""kludge"" methods to work. The main function of this particular bean (code not included) is to catch unhandled exceptions and report them via email to us for more specific error handling in future revisions. The basic use-case here is to simplify programmatic access to EL, and potentially to allow writing back to EL using the value binding, though that's not possible in this particular code. I know I can do the below using other methods, that's not the point. Realistically, it's a positive thing to make it easier to access EL programmatically IMO, especially when dealing with some of the more exotic scopes (especially Flash scope) introduced by JSF 2.0.

5453848,Doob's inequality in probability,"In the book ""Optimal Stopping and Free-Boundary Problems"" there is given Doob's inequality of the following form. Let $X = (X_t,F_t)$ be a submartingale.

Let $X_0 = 0$, $$ X_1 = \begin{cases} 1, &amp;\quad p = 1/3; \\ 0, &amp;\quad p = 1/3; \\ -1,&amp;\quad p =1/3. \end{cases} $$ and $X_2 = 1$ if $X_1 = 1$, $X_2 = 0$ if $X_1 = -1$ and $$ X_2 = \begin{cases} 1, &amp;\quad p = 1/2; \\ -1,&amp;\quad p =1/2. \end{cases} $$ if $X_1 = 0$. Finally, $X_n = X_2$ for all $n\geq 2$. It is easy to check that this is a submartingale. On the other hand, for $\varepsilon = 1$ we have $$ \mathsf P\left\{\sup\limits_{n\leq 2}|X_n|\geq 1\right\} = 1 $$ but $\mathsf E[|X_0|] = 0$, $\mathsf E[|X_1|] = 2/3$ and $\mathsf E[|X_2|] = 2/3$ - so we have inequality $1\leq 2/3$.

I decided that these mapping should be made ""fold aware"" so that moving text up one line will move it past a closed fold. But when I play around with these mappings vim will corrupt my folds. The mappings: The mappings work by calling the function. The argument to is the absolute line number below which the text should be moved. Test File: The Problem: When I load the test file (with all folds closed) and place the cursor on one of the folds then at first the AltUp and AltDown keys seem to move the fold like one expects. But if you keep moving the folds past one another enough then: Folds start becoming unexpanded (""corrupted"") for no apparent reason. You can't close these folds, because vim cannot detect that there is a fold there anymore. Saving and re-editing the file () seems to fix the folds. Sometimes it will happen with the first movement, and sometimes not. I've even had test cases where folds boundaries would be detected incorrectly instead of not being detected at all. For example, a fold that Vim thinks starts with the intermediate line . --- Edit --- More testing: Moving fold A seems to cause most of the problems. If you don't touch fold A, I think you can move folds B, C, and D around without encountering a problem. If you move fold A up twice (see note-1) it will corrupt folds B, C, and D.

5626854,".NET Application Memory usage grow over time, memory leak or not?","I wrote a .NET application where memory usage is growing over time. As a test, I set it up to download 800 * 5K (average) size files and doing XML transform and using DTComcontroller to generate manifest, inside 1 hour with an interval of 15 Minutes. During a period of about 5 hours, memory usage grows from 35M to about 70M. Not sure if this is normal or not. I'm already forcing it by doing at end of each working circle just to make sure the memory are released in a timely manner. I already make sure close filehandle, clear stream or other resources after used it. And some objects are just using local references inside a function and I assume they will be discarded at the end of local function and go away with GC.collction(). Also Memory Profiler (ANTS) shows that there are no objects with my application's namespace left at the end of each of the working circle, and no new objects with source code available left as well. The new instances of objects created during each working circle are basically called RuntimeModule, RuntimeAssembly, and DeviceContext. Doesn't looks like I could do anything about it? This is basically my first application which are suppose to run 24/7 and I really don't know much about memeory leak. More likely than not, there are still problems with memory usage in my application. I just don't know where to look at this stage. Also, I don't know it's related or not, I am using .net Trace/debug for keep a log. Guess it worth trying to turn off the log to see the memory usage grow. Update: Dose it look like circle reference of sslstate and sslstream and also other Classes in the class Reference Explorer. Also not sure if that is a circle reference in ANTS generated graph, that means there is actually circle reference in my code somewhere? I did a few changes by reusing the same object for XMLtransform and Manifest creation, and manually set each Object to null after finish used them in the end of working iteration. Now the memory are greatly reduced, still increase private memory usage as it is working, but much slowly. I think for my particular case--create lots of objects inside a working circle, and every data is kept in a working thread. If I didn't explicitly release object references, let .NET GC doing that will lead to lots of memory used by the application as it is keep working most of the time, and GC may never get a chance to probably doing house keeping unless the application been manually closed, I have to do the object release much more manually. @WeNeedAnswers:","['GC.collection();\nGC.WaitForPendingFinalizers();\n', '            XmlDocument doc = new XmlDocument();\n            XmlTextReader textReader = new XmlTextReader(dataFile);\n            textReader.Read();\n            doc.Load(textReader);\n']",False

We have a web page that hides the via CSS and then there's a bit of JavaScript that sets the to to show it. (This is part of some iFrame busting logic we are required to add). We were having issues on one page but only in Safari. In taking a look at things, I found that the culprit was that an include file was being called that contained its own tag so we were ending up with malformed HTML with a tag nested within the pages existing tag. Since the JS was looking for the first tag the content we actually wanted to show was never shown, since it was wrapped with the second tag. I assume Firefox was just forgiving of the HTML and ignored the second tag. Safari didn't do this when we looked at the page on the server. However, if I grab the file and run it locally, Safari does tell me: Extra encountered. Migrating attributes back to the original element and ignoring the tag. I'm curious as to why Safari might have adopted this 'policy' of ignoring bad HTML locally but not from a server. If it matters, it is an https site we're hitting. Perhaps Safari is being wise and trying to avoid any potential security issues with allowing bad HTML?","['body', 'body', 'display: block', 'body', 'body', 'body', 'body', 'body', 'body', '&lt;body&gt;', '&lt;body&gt;']",False

For most users, the ""direct download"" works fine; however for some users (especially those behind firewall / NAT), they always need special proxy settings when making connections. It's painful to write code to handle all these cases so I hope WinINET with can help me. It does for most users, however I still find some users complaining connection failure.

I've noticed the View Model is starting to get bloated. There are two main issues. One is that to maintain MVVM, I'm doing a lot of things that feel hacky like adding a bunch of properties to my VM.

For example, a boolean keeping track of the status of a long running process in the VM, so the view can disable some of its controls while the long running process is working.

I'm defining the commands in the VM using Josh Smith's RelayCommand (basically the DelegateCommand in PRISM) so all the business logic lives in the VM.

5941402,Using Solr to store user specified information in documents,"I have an application that contains a set of text documents that users can search for. Every user must be able to search based on the text of the documents. What is more, users must be able to define custom tags and associate them to a document. Those tags are used in two ways: 1)Users must be able to search for documents based on specific tag ids. 2)There must be facets available for the tags. My solution was adding a Mutivalued field in each document to pose as an array that contains the tagids that this document has been tagged with. So far so good. I was able to perform queries based on text and tagids ( for example text:hi AND tagIds:56 ). My question is, would that solution work in production mode in an environment that users add but also remove tags from the documents ? Remember , I have to have the data available in real time, so whenever a user removes/adds a tag I have to reindex that document and commit immediately. If that's not a good solution, what would be an alternative ?",[],True

Where does shared &amp; view come from? I checked the rest of the file, there is no method named shared or view. so obviously, they coming from one of hundreds of classes being included using require_once() But which one? how can I find out? Can I get a list of all the functions or methods that are being executed? If yes, then how? this class SiteController overrides a base Common class.

5953906,"RMI ConnectException : Connection refused, really strange behaviour","I know that this question has been asked several times but I've yet to find an answer that works for me. Basically I've implemented a client/server solution with RMI. My only problem is that connection to the server is sometimes extremely slow. When the server is started and a client connects, for the first time, it will take seconds before it gets connected (sometimes it does not even connect but get the ConnectException instead) and after that I will get the Connection refused when trying to communicate with the server. What makes it even more mind boggling is that it works perfectly fine when I disconnect the first failing client and connect again. The client then connects in under a second and all the communication works flawlessy. I've tried manually starting the rmiregistry, I've double checked my PATH. I wasn't able to connect to the port with telnet but it works when I play on that port with my Othello game (which is not using RMI). It might be worth to say that I'm doing this on the same network and computer so I'm using localhost. TL;DR: When I first connect to the server it takes forever, but I'm able to connect. When I then try to communicate with methods it crashes and I receive ""java.rmi.ConnectException: Connection refused to host: 192.xxx.xxx.x; nested exception is: java.net.ConnectException: Connection timed out: connect"". If I then close that client and try to connect with another client it takes around one second to connect and then everything works flawlessy. Why is that?
