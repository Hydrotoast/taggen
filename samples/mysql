169974,Load balancing for webservers (with state sync),"(I've looked at other questions, I don't think any of them cover the same stuff as this) I'm looking at a load balancing solution for our farm of webservers. We currently use Cisco CSS11000 series devices, but these have a few limitations: We currently offload SSL, which I'm aware puts load on the LBs, rather than being able to horizontally scale SSL work over multiple webservers The CSS LBs don't support IPv6 The CSSs don't work very well for failover - we want to be able to gracefully move user traffic around to let us upgrade webservers without service interruption. Aims: Let us deactivate half of the webservers in a 'graceful' way (i.e. new user connections go to a specified subgroup of webservers, and it tells us when existing connections are closed - bonus points if it can force them to close gracefully so users don't notice). Let us restart/reconfigure the load balancers without interrupting service Support the usual HA stuff you'd expect (If a single server explodes or crashes, don't break) I'd like to do this without spending $$$ on commercial / hardware load balancers I'd like to do this on Linux if possible to utilise internal experience. The rest of the business likes ""Enterprise"" stuff because they can blame Someone Else when it goes wrong. So whatever I recommend to put in place needs to be as reliable as a commercial solution. Ideas: Two pairs of HAProxy. We'd use the HAProxy socket control mechanism (http://code.google.com/p/haproxy-docs/wiki/UnixSocketCommands) to gracefully remove webservers. Each pair would use heartbeat to maintain service, and we'd modify the DNS to point at the other pair to move new user connections over to the other pair. Would need some form of monitoring to tell us when a particular pair had 0 active connections. Two Linux machines doing the balancing with iptables and the -m random module. I'd use heartbeat to keep the HA VIP live on one of the machines, and I'd use conntrackd to synchronise the TCP connection state, so we can failover without loss of service. Would need some scripting to insert/remove iptables rules depending on the state of the backends (Unless anyone knows of a tool?) Does anyone have any comments on the above?

183296,Programming problem - Game of Blocks,"maybe you would have an idea on how to solve the following problem. John decided to buy his son Johnny some mathematical toys. One of his most favorite toy is blocks of different colors. John has decided to buy blocks of C different colors. For each color he will buy googol (10^100) blocks. All blocks of same color are of same length. But blocks of different color may vary in length. Jhonny has decided to use these blocks to make a large 1 x n block. He wonders how many ways he can do this. Two ways are considered different if there is a position where the color differs. The example shows a red block of size 5, blue block of size 3 and green block of size 3. It shows there are 12 ways of making a large block of length 11. Each test case starts with an integer 1 ≤ C ≤ 100. Next line consists c integers. ith integer 1 ≤ leni ≤ 750 denotes length of ith color. Next line is positive integer N ≤ 10^15. This problem should be solved in 20 seconds for T &lt;= 25 test cases. The answer should be calculated (prime number). It can be deduced to matrix exponentiation problem, which can be solved relatively efficiently in O(N^2.376*log(max(leni))) using Coppersmith-Winograd algorithm and fast exponentiation.

First method starts a function in a background thread that checks shared data and the other one updates that data. It was working fine and suddenly started acting strange.

Here is the simplified code Service: Client: While debugging I noticed several things. After Configure() starts WorkerFunction() in new thread, the thread is alive for a second or so, while WorkerFunction() has access to stringCollection that was configured in Configure(). When client calls UpdateData() method for the first time the method has empty stringCollection (not containing data added from Configure() method) as if its not shared while stringCollection preserve its data between each UpdateData() call. For example: If I susspend Thread with highest priority in Threads window while debugging, than the background thread stays alive like it supposed to do but I get the same result as above. WorkerFunction() has its own instance of stringCollection and UpdateData() has another one.

If cell from table contain UItextView (non editable and non scrollable in my case), and user selects its text (copy menu shows up), the cell that contains that particular UITextView will not work as it should any more. UITableView will not fire willDisplayCell and cellForRowAtIndexPath methods for that cell any more. I made some tests, and cells are removed from visibleCells array when they are off screen, and they are put back into the visibleCells array when they are on screen again, but delegate methods are not being called. This is very annoying since it prevents you to configure your reusable cells. I am not sure if this is considered a bug at all. I would like if you could double check and confirm this behavior. Here is my simplified test code, so you can check it for yourself: By running this code you can see that selecting text in first cell will lead to tableview stop firing delegate events when cell is on the screen again. By pressing button you can check that number of visible cells is always correct, so it means that cells are being added and removed to visible cells list.

718280,xelatex and pgfpages compatibility,"I've just switched from pdflatex to xelatex for my lectures to take advantage of the package so that I can change the colours of all my mathematics. When compiling the ""handout"" version last night, I found that it didn't work as I expected. I use the package to produce the handout as a 4-up document (with a nice box round each frame) to save paper. But the page size in the resulting document was that of one slide, not a full a4 piece of paper. A little googling led me to a quick fix on tug: with the comment (from the author): Probably not the cleanest way of doing things, so if someone has a better idea and/or can locate the bug exactly, comments welcome. There were no follow-up comments, but it was dated November 2008. In June 2009, there's a similar-looking problem on the xetex mailing list with this response: That's a reported (and probably not fixed yet) problem in pgfpages. Use this to tell pgfpages how to set page sizes in XeLaTeX: (These are (linked from) the top two hits on google for ). My real question is: is this going to get fixed? But that's not a good tex.SE question. So my attempt to make it into a good question is: The second of the above seems the better of the two. Is that the best way to fix this problem?

I know there are some options: Naturally, pipe the text I need directly from some command's output to a file, or right to the next command.

I read here about various opinions like having one table for it, others says to have two. However I'm trying the most effecient way with only neccesarry data entries. This is my table so far: id, uid, type, read (boolean), date. So I thought of one example: Insert a comment, call notification function that inserts my uid (user_id), type (comment, like, etc), read='1', NOW(). I set read to 1, because I don't want to get notified when I'm posting something. Then I thought I'll update by setting read to 0 by all other users, because they haven't read this new post yet. But now I'm thinking of another post that will be made 5sec later or something. Then all other entries are set to 0 again, which is right, but in this scenario I can't think of displaying (SELECT) the right results for each single user. Because it isn't specified which user missed which new notification(s). I hope you could follow me and have any suggestions. If I'm doing it the wrong way in general I'd also appreciate advices.","['notfication', 'notification', 'read']",False

There are several ways to implement the shortcodes into the tinymce editor (from a usability perspective) and I'm looking for some examples that represent some of the better implementations you've seen. For example, I could use a single button that opens a jQuery modal dialog window containing visual representations of all my shortcodes (similar to Optimize Press), or I could just list individual icons on the editor toolbar, one icon for each shortcode. I'm actually looking for an example of a hybrid approach using jQuery for enhanced usability.

The problem is, when running as a service under LocalSystem, it doesn't want to create or write to the file at all. As you can see, the directory is hardcoded in so there isn't any base directory conflicts seeing as LocalSystem would start in System32 or something of that nature. The permissions on the folder lets the System account access it fully (windows 7) so why am I not able to create/write to that file? Thanks for any input! Edit: Apparently the logging program thread is running as LocalSystem as well, when I really need it to be running as a standard user. So how do I execute a threaded process from the service to run under the local user account instead of under LocalSystem. I use Thread.new(process) where process is an additional program. The process program needs to receive input before it writes anything, and it isn't receiving input because it's on the wrong account.

However, if it is frowned upon to override the ActiveRecord base initialize method, what is the proper way to provide parameters to an ActiveRecord model when you want to initialize with values as you would in a standard Ruby class method. so you can The only thing I have come across was actually overrideing the method but calling first in the initialize. However, this was frowned on because ActiveRecord's base class uses in allot of cases to instantiate an AR object and therefore could end up sidestepping the entire initialize method. So, maybe there is another fundamental reason why I am not finding providing initial values as a standard practice in RoR? I know I can use validates in the object to validate an object can't be saved without meeting requirements, such as having all the proper attributes set. But I was approaching this particular object, so that it wouldn't be created without the required attributes when it is initialized to begin (since at initialization we would have all that information and if retrieving from the DB we would have all those values). Can someone help direct me? extra question If there is an accepted way to do the above, there seems to be another area that needs to be considered when initializing objects with values and that is when the object is initialized from being retrieved from the DB. Not handling the initializing values properly can possibly override what is retrieved from the DB (or I have read when related to setting attributes to default values).

1084061,Passing handle to C++ classes across a C API boundary,"I am writing a library in C++, but want it to have a C API, which should also be thread safe. One thing that the API needs to do is to pass back and forth handles (e.g. a structure containing a reference or pointer) of objects created within the library. These objects need to be destroyed at some point, so any handles to such an object that were still in existence would them become invalid. EDIT: We cannot assume that each handle is only used within a single client thread. In particular I want to handle the case where there are two client threads accessing the same resource simultaneously, one trying to destroy it while the other tries to modify it There are two paradigms for dealing with this. One is the smart pointer paradigm, for example boost::shared_ptr or std::shared_ptr, which make sure the object is only destroyed when there are no more references to it. However, as I understand it, such pointers aren't possible to implement in C (as it doesn't support constructors and destructors), so this approach won't work in my case. I don't want to rely on the user to call a ""release"" function for every instance of a handle they obtain, since they inevitably won't. Another paradigm is to simply destroy the object within the library, and have any subsequent function calls which pass a handle to that object as an input simply return an error code. My question is what techniques or libraries are available to implement this approach, specifically in a multi-threaded application? EDIT: The library should of course handle all the allocation of deallocation of internal memory itself. Smart pointers may be also used within the library; they may not be passed across the API, however. EDIT: More detail on handles might be used on the client side: the client might have two threads, one of which creates an object. That thread might pass the handle to the second thread, or the second thread might get it from the library using a ""find_object"" function. The second thread might then continuously update the object, but while that is going on the first thread might destroy the object, making all handles to the object invalid. I appreciate rough suggestions of an approach - I have come up with some of these myself too. However, the nitty gritty details of things like how a C++ class instance is retrieved and locked, given a handle, while other threads may be attempting to destroy that object, are non-trivial, so I'm really after answers like ""I have done the following and it works without fail."" or, even better, ""This library implements what you're after sensibly and safely"".",[],False

My problem is about custom converters for my custom types and database connection from within my converter. Let's say I have a type Person and the Person has a field of my custom type Title, and all Titles are already in my database. Now I have an html form, in which a user can populate a Person instance, including selecting the Title in a select drop-down box. In the flow definition I get all Titles from the database and they are shown in the dropdown box using a custom converter, converting Title to String and later back to Title. My question is about the process of converting back from String (which is the database ID, which I set as value on the element) to the correct Title object from my database. Basically: How to do it? So far, I was unable to get a titleManager injected into my converter to get access to the database. This scenario was commented on in the Spring Web Flow Forum. Another solution might be to cache the Titles before rendering the view and somehow get the in-memory Title after the form was POSTed.

Should I look at any of Apple's libraries, such as vImage, or parts of the Accelerate framework, etc, or is this something so specific that I'll have to tackle it by hand, going over each pixel in my NxN matrix to see if it lies in the region of interest? It seems like there has to be a more efficient way to do it than just hard coding a couple of for loops. Especially if the region had some arbitrary definition, say a squiggly loop drawn by a user.

It seems to me many of the metadata tags and content type fields could be the same leading to users using one or the other. For instance, If I have a Content Type field for managing legal contracts I would define a content type for ""Contract"" which contains fields like the type of contract. So a user would select ""Employment"" for the contract type when adding it to a library. Likewise I could use a Managed Meta tag like ""Employment Contract"" to do the same.

Now i need to persist the object ""A"".And after i persist the object ""A"" ,i need to persist the object ""B"".I can successfully persist the object ""A"" ,but when i persist ""B"" i get the exception The Reason for that is already the object ""C"" is persisted when ""A"" is persisted.And when ""B"" is being persisted it also tries to persist ""C"" again.Thats why the persistenceException. I tried to merge the object C before i persist object ""B"".Even then i get the same exception. Please provide me with a work around. Also let me know if any one needs any further info.

1408440,using routed events within Silverlight user controls,within my current project file I have a user control that has a storyboard animation applied to the control. When a button is clicked in the page the storyboard starts and basically visually presents the control to the user. The storyboard resides in the current page as a resource Within the page I have button that I have a click event on that starts the storyboard Within the userControl (preferencesPanel) I have a button that when clicked needs to close/collapse the user control. I plan to do this using Visibility.collapsed. I assume that I need to use routed commands since the button is within the user control but the actions need to be called within the page that contains the control? I'm still new to routed commands and I assume this is the correct approach. I'm just unsure how to click on a button within the user control and have it modify or execute commands that would impact how the page (in which this control resides) may change or for that part affect other elements within the page? For example when the button is clicked within the user control I would like the visibility of the user control to be set to collapsed. I also would like to have the width of one of the grid columns within the main page re-size. I have done this in the past using the code behind for the page but I am trying to separate some of this and I thought routed commands would be the way to go? I'd greatly appreciate any tips.

1433412,Unable to see second animation started from separate animationDidStop,"I'm having some problems getting CoreAnimation to perform multiple animations in succession on the iPhone simulator. I have many layers in my application that I animate – these layers are all sublayers of the layer associated with a UIView in my application. After I animate the first sublayer's position (using explicit animation - CAKeyFrameAnimation), I do the following in the animationDidStop delegate method: I remove the layer from its superlayer I start a CATransaction to animate 2 other sublayers' positions simultaneously - these layers are also animated explicitly with individual CAKeyframeAnimations added to the respective layers. I then reuse the 1st layer with different contents and add that back to the superlayer in a separate position (intentionally not animated). When I run my application, I see the first animation occur, the layer then gets removed, and the layer gets added back with new contents in the new position, but I never see the animation of the 2 layers in step 2. Interestingly, I do get animationDidStop calls for each of the 2 layers animating in the transaction. Since I get these calls it would appear the animations are occurring, but the animations do not appear on screen. I also tried removing the transaction in case I didn't have that set up correctly and am seeing the same results. Is it possible to link together multiple animations in this manner?

1467214,MVP Pattern - Ways to restrict the user action based on security privilleges,"In an MVP application, what should be the most appropriate way to implement restriction to some UI actions based on the current user's privileges? For example, in a role-based security, different roles will have different access to some UI interactions on the same view. If, for instance, we have an online store, on the products list page the customers can only view the details and add items to their cart, but an administrator must be also presented with buttons and button on each item. Similar question has been asked here already, but the OP is asking for the UI making the permission checks. I am certain the UI (view) should not be responsible for permission validation, but still it has to know whether to visualize or not certain UI components. So, is there any well-defined or widely adopted pattern for telling the view which UI interactions it should disallow? I can think of a few solutions, but if there is a standard and proven one, I'd prefer to stick with that, rather than reinventing the wheel. Update To clarify a bit further, as suggested in answers below, I am considering the approach of having the view accept the privileges information from the presenter. It is the form of that information that bothers me - if using flags as bit masks or some too-generic representation I will: (+) Gain consistency in passing the permissions to the view (-) Couple the view with logic for resolving the flags. The other thing I have in mind is having the View expose all the flags it needs as settable properties for the presenter (like ). So I will: (+) Not have additional logic for the permissions in the view (-) Add additional complexity to presenter to adapt permission flags to the view's properties. So, I am thinking of using the later approach, because that way I can reuse the presenter with different view implementations; and will not rely on the view for understanding the permissions system (which may be a subject of changes). Is there anything I should worry about with that?","['Add Product', 'Delete', 'view.IsDeleteItemAllowed']",False

1479818,Combinatorial Optimization - Variation on Knapsack,"Here is a real-world combinatorial optimization problem. We are given a large set of value propositions for a certain product. The value propositions are of different types but each type is independent and adds equal benefit to the overall product. In building the product, we can include any non-negative integer number of ""units"" of each type. However, after adding the first unit of a certain type, the marginal benefit of additional units of that type continually decreases. In fact, the marginal benefit of a new unit is the inverse of the number of units of that type, after adding the new unit. Our product must have a least one unit of some type, and there is a small correction that we must make to the overall value because of this requirement. Let be an array representing the number of each type in a certain production run of the product. Then the overall value is given by (pseudo code): On cost side, units of the same type have the same cost. But units of different types each have unique, irrational costs. The number of types is large, but we are given an array of type costs that is sorted from smallest to largest. Let's further assume that the type quantity array is also sorted by cost from smallest to largest. Then the overall cost is simply the sum of each unit cost: So far so good.

We're going to start to need to implement some sort of socket communication, or 'long-polling', to push updates to the flash app. Since this obviously isn't going to be a good situation for Apache, or PHP, I'd like to use Tornado for this aspect of the functionality, but I also don't want to run Tornado on another port, since the Flash app will be running on the client machine, we don't want to have to deal with restrictive firewalls blocking the socket connections. Ideally I'd like to run a proxy which can forward most requests to Apache, and other requests to Tornado. I saw some suggestions for using Apache as the first-contact proxy, forward requests to Tornado when necessary, but I've also seen this discounts a lot of the async capabilities of Tornado. I thought, why no use Tornado as the first-contact for port 80 and have it proxy back to Apache? I couldn't find anything on this at all and am wondering if this is even possible? Another option would be to use something like lighttpd as the proxy and have it decide whether to pass things along to Apache or to Tornado, but does this kind of setup make sense?

1582971,Adding a clustered index to a SQL table: what dangers exist for a live production system?,"Right, keep in mind i need to describe this by abstracting all possible confidential info: I've been put in charge of a 10-year old transactional system of which the majority business logic is implemented at database level (triggers, stored procedures etc). Win2000 server, MSSQL 2000 Enterprise. No immediate plans for replacing/updating the system are being considered :( The core process is a program that executes transactions - specifically, it executes a stored procedure with various parameters, lets call it sp_ProcessTrans. The program executes the stored procedure at asynchronous intervals. By itself, things work fine. But there are 30 instances of this program on remotely located workstations, all of them asynchronously executing sp_ProcessTrans and then retrieving data from the SQL server (execution is pretty regular - ranging 0 to 60 times a minute, depending on what items the program instance is responsible for) . Performance of the system has dropped considerably with 10 yrs of data growth: the reason is the deadlocks and specifically deadlock wait times. The deadlock is on the Employee table. I have discovered: In sp_ProcessTrans' execution, it selects from an Employee table 7 times (dont ask) The select is done on a field that is NOT the primary key No index exists on this field. Thus a table scan is performed. 7 times. per transaction So the reason for deadlocks is clear. I created a non-unique ordered clustered index on the field (field looks good, almost unique, NUM(7), very rarely changes). Immediate improvement in the test environment. The problem is that i cannot simulate the deadlocks in a test environment (I'd need 30 workstations; i'd need to simulate 'realistic' activity on those stations, so visualization is out). I need to know if i must schedule downtime. Creating an index shouldn't be a risky operation for MSSQL, but is there any danger (data corruption in transactions/select statements/extra wait time etc) to create this field index on the production database while the transactions are still taking place? (although i can select a time when transactions are fairly quiet through the 30 stations) Are there any hidden dangers i'm not seeing (not looking forward to needing to restore the DB if something goes wrong, restoring would take a lot of time with 10yrs of data).",[],False

1602383,In CSS how to get three containers automatically resize height based on content,"What I have is three containers with dynamically added content. Basically I want those three rows to take up the height of the browser window only. But I want them to resize automatically based on their inner content. So if they all have the same amount of content, each of them have a height of about 33% and then an overflow: auto. Or if one container has no content and the other two have lots of content the container with no content should have a height of 0 and the other two should be 50%. Also, there is no need to support IE - it's for an internal product and only chrome and firefox browsers are used so if there is a css3 solution then that is okay.

1697675,In what order should we implement Asp.Net Mvc App,"This might be odd question but I am just goig to start a new Medium size WebApplication using Asp.Net MVC. Every person has his own approach towards a solution, but there are always some practices followed. While Working With Asp.Net Forms Application I always, worked in following order Database Data Access Layer (LinqToSql / Ado.Net Entities etc) BLL(Business Logic Layer + Business Objects) Front End ( Forms, design etc and) Authentication, Testing (integration) and others etc (parallel unit testing starts with BLL) Now I have finished MVC books and tutorial and about to start working on Application. Database is the already there. I will be using LinqToSql for DAL (Model(s)). What Order Should I follow for the implementation of Model, View and Controller. I am confused as all tutorials have different approach. Like. some start from routing table, some start from Controllers Component, then touch Views, then advise to shift the logic into models, ""If Controllerskeep on growing"". Model(s), for every process in the specification. I am not sure what is the right approach. It would be great to have word over the order you use to implement your components / stages. I am also not sure about stage for starting unit testing. I have tried to make myself clear, please do ask if not sure, You are welcome to edit title or the post itself, if you feel that would be better.

In case the password is used to compute a key used for encryption (""Password Based Encryption""): what if you do not store the password at al? [Note: I did read SO: Passphrase, Salt and IV, do I need all of these? and Does IV work like salt are certainly a related question: I am not sure how the Initialization Vector discussed there relates to the question here] Suppose: For encryption the users enters a master password this is SHA256 hashed and the output is used to AES256 encrypt a file the hash is not stored (and obviously neither is the master password) For decryption The users enters the master password This is SHA256 hashed and the output is used to decrypt the file If the decryption was successful, the password was - apparently - correct My question: When not storing anything except the encrypted file itself, is there any benefit in salting the master password before hashing it? Considerations: it would probably reduce the likelihood of a hash-collision it would require the salt to be stored. if the salt were lost/corrupted the user would not be able to decrypt the file anymore how to check for successful decryption in step3: does this require part of the file contents to be known? if so, how much of a faux-pas is storing a known value in an encrypted file (this cannot always be prevented - an attacker might guess that for example the users last name is encrypted somewhere in the file - an be correct).",[],False

1794223,Rails Cache Sweeper and Model Callback Firing,"I have the following classes: Everything works as expected; however, the in the sweeper requires that the method in the model has finished before it can run properly. The problem is that the in the sweeper is being called before (or perhaps at the same time as) the callback and it's causing problems. Does anyone know how to force the in the sweeper to fire after the model callback? Is there better way to achieve this? Update/Fix: As it turns out, unlike the answer below states, the observer callbacks actually ARE firing in the correct order (after the model callbacks). When I discovered this, I realized something else must be wrong. The method destroys all of a vigil's slots, and replaces them with the correct number of slots with the correct times. The observer relies on the number of slots to figure out how long the vigil should last. So, the underlying problem was that all of the vigil's slots were being destroyed, and that data was cached, so when I called from the observer, it was using the cached (destroyed slots) data. The solution: simply call vigil.slots(true) at the end of to reload/recache the newly created slots!","['class Vigil &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\n  after_update :do_something_cool\n\n  private\n    def do_something_cool\n      # Sweet code here\n    end\nend\n\nclass NewsFeedObserver &lt; ActionController::Caching::Sweeper\n  observe Vigil\n\n  def after_update\n    # Create a news feed entry\n  end\nend\n', 'after_update', 'do_something_cool', 'after_update', 'do_something_cool', 'after_update', 'do_something_cool', 'vigil.slots', 'do_something_cool']",False

The Reason the HttpPost does not return View is that doing that from a child action returns just the partial view - not what I want.

I have a pixel shader ""preProc"" which processes my vertices and saves three textures of data. One for per-pixel normals, one for per-pixel position data and one for color and depth (color takes up rgb and depth takes the alpha channel). I then later use these textures in a postprocessing shader in order to implement Screen Space Ambient Occlusion, however it seems none of the data is getting saved in the first shader. Here's my pixel shader: which outputs the following struct: and takes the following struct for input: However in my postprocessing shader: It simply outputs a light-blue screen (the colour I reset my render targets to at the start of each frame). getCol has been tested to work and returns a colour from the renderTex material when only dealing with one render target. If I change the pixelshader to instead sample the randomTex texture (which my code previously loaded from a file and is not a render target) everything is rendered fine, so I am confident it is not my post processing shader.

If this isn't the case (I can't yet be sure if it is or isn't), then how would I go about unassigning the render targets in SlimDX?

1907506,Fastest way to modify a decimal-keyed table in MySQL?,"I am dealing with a MySQL table here that is keyed in a somewhat unfortunate way. Instead of using an auto increment table as a key, it uses a column of decimals to preserve order (presumably so its not too difficult to insert new rows while preserving a primary key and order). Before I go through and redo this table to something more sane, I need to figure out how to rekey it without breaking everything. What I would like to do is something that takes a list of doubles (the current keys) and outputs a list of integers (which can be cast down to doubles for rekeying). For example, input {1.00, 2.00, 2.50, 2.60, 3.00} would give output {1, 2, 3, 4, 5). Since this is a database, I also need to be able to update the rows nicely: Can anyone think of a speedy algorithm to do this? My current thought is to read all of the doubles into a vector, take the size of the vector, and output a new vector with values from . This seems pretty slow, since you wouldn't want to read every value into the vector if, for instance, only the last elements needed to be modified. I think there is probably something I can do in place, since only values after the first non-integer double need to be modified, but I can't for the life of me figure anything out that would let me update in place as well. For instance, setting 2.60 to 3.00 the first time you see 2.50 in the original key list would result in an error, since the key value 3.00 is already used for the table. Edit: I guess what this really abstracts to is this: I need a way to convert an ordered map keyed with doubles into an ordered map keyed with integers, where at no point does there ever exist two values for one key (which is a violation of a map anyway).","[""UPDATE table SET `key`='3.00' WHERE `key`='2.50';\n"", '1 =&gt; doubleVector.size', 'n/100']",True

2086579,iPhone - calling a method in parent view controller,"have hunted around for an answer to this one, but can't seem to find a definitive solution - hoping someone can help here! I'm building a multiview app for the iPhone. I've created a UIViewController called ""MainViewController"", which loads in other views as required. There's quite a lot of navigation between screens, so what I'd like to do is have a ""ViewSwitcher"" method in MainViewController that the child view controllers can call to ask for the view to switch away to another child view. How can I call the ""ViewSwitcher"" method from the child controllers? I've managed to achieve this at present by creating an UIView *""parent"" property in each child view controller, and populating this on first loading the child view. I can then call the method using [parent ViewSwitcher]. This seems a bit clunky, and I'm concerned I'm creating some horribly recursive structure. Is there a better way? Thanks in advance.",[],False

2201000,A sub-additivity inequality,"In trying to understand a result of D. Rider (Trans. AMS, 1973) I've got stuck on a lemma that he uses. At one point he makes a step without comment or explanation, but I can't see why it works. Here is a paraphrase of what I think he is claiming. Let $d_1,\dots, d_n$ be complex numbers of modulus $1$; let $b_1,\dots, b_n$ be complex numbers of modulus $\leq 1$. (In the intended application the numbers $b_1,\dots, b_n$ are actually the diagonal entries of a unitary $n\times n$ matrix, but I strongly suspect that is not used in the argument.) Then Rider seems to assert, without further comment, that $$ \left\vert\sum_{j=1}^n (d_jb_j-1)\right\vert^{1/2} \leq \left\vert\sum_{j=1}^n (d_j-1)\right\vert^{1/2} + \left\vert\sum_{j=1}^n (b_j-1)\right\vert^{1/2} $$ Probably I am just being dense, and have failed to spot a routine estimate that does the job. If anyone could get me started on the right track that would be most helpful, as this is starting to get very irritating, and is not even the main part of Rider's argument. Update Firstly, thanks to everyone who answered, but in particular to Will Jagy for various off-MSE exchanges, and to George Lowther for his elegant argument (the key part that I had failed to think of, was the use of $\rm Re$ and its linearity rather than $\vert\cdot\vert$ and its sub-additivity, allowing one to boost up the observation made by Gerry Myerson). In case it's of interest, here are some more details on how the question I asked corresponds to Lemma 5.1 in Rider's paper. The paper is dealing with central trigonometric polynomials on compact groups, which means: linear combinations of traces of irreducible representations. Paraphrased lightly, and with a fairly trivial reduction step thrown in, the aforementioned lemma says the following: Let $\phi: G \to U(n)$ be an (irreducible) unitary representation of a (compact) group $G$. If $$\vert n^{-1}\operatorname{\rm Tr}\phi(g_i)-z_i\vert \leq \delta_i \qquad(i=1,\dots, p)$$ where $\vert z_i\vert=1$ for all $i$, then $$ \left\vert n^{-1}\operatorname{Tr}\phi(g_1\dotsb g_n) - \prod_{i=1}^p z_i \right\vert \leq \left(\sum_{i=1}^p \delta_i^{1/2}\right)^2 $$ The proof given in the paper goes as follows: reduce to the case $p=2$ (if this can be done then induction will do the rest); then observe that WLOG $\phi(g_1)$ is a diagonal unitary matrix, w.r.t. an appropriate basis. If we let $d_1,\dots, d_n$ be the diagonal entries of $\phi(g_1)$ and $b_1,\dots, b_n$ be those of $\phi(g_2)$, then the trace of $\phi(g_1g_2)$ is just $\sum_{i=1}^n d_ib_i$, and so we have to prove Claim. If $|z_1|=|z_2|=1$, $\left\vert\sum_{i=1}^n (d_i - z_1)\right\vert\leq n\delta_1$, and $\left\vert\sum_{i=1}^n (b_i - z_2)\right\vert\leq n\delta_2$, then $$\left\vert \sum_{i=1}^n (d_ib_i - z_1z_2) \right\vert \leq n(\delta_1^{1/2}+\delta_2^{1/2})^2. $$ This is where Rider is content to say ""done""; and it is hopefully clear that this is equivalent to my original question.",[],False

Fortunately, I was able to set up everything correctly, and also to run my app on the device. I've learned C++ in school, so I thought it won't be so difficult. I use Qt Creator as my IDE, because it doesn't work with Visual Studio. I also wish to port my app to Symbian, so I have run the emulator a few times, and I also compile for Windows to debug the most evil bugs. (The debugger doesn't work correctly on the device.) I come from a .NET background, so there are some things that I don't understand. When I hit the build button, Qt Creator generates a bunch of files to my project directory: moc_*.cpp files - I don't know their purpose. Could someone tell me? *.o files - I assume these are the object code *.rss files - I don't know their purpose, but they definitely don't have anything to do with RSS Makefile and - I have no idea AppName (without extension) - the executable for Maemo, and - the executable for Symbian, I guess? AppName.loc - I have no idea AppName_installer.pkg and - I have no idea qrc_Resources.cpp - I guess this is for my Qt resources (where is the name of the application in question) I noticed that these files can be safely deleted, Qt Creator simply regenerates them. The problem is that they pollute my source directory. Especially because I use version control, and if they can be regenerated, there is no point in uploading them to SVN. So, could someone please tell me what the exact purpose of these files is, and how can I ask Qt Creator to place them into another directory? Thank you in advance! EDIT: It seems that I learned more from the answers of this question than I thought I would. :) Big thanks to everyone who helped me out. I gave everyone an upvote, because I could learn something new from every answer. Actually, what Rob recommended seems to be the most convenient solution, but I marked Kotti's answer accepted, because he provided me with the best explanation about how Qt's build mechanism works. Again, thanks to everyone!

Like for instance how do I sort it and keep those together.","['Item Name            Price\nCoffee               $1.00\nWater                $2.00\nMilk                 $1.50\nBagel                $1.25\nDonut                $0.75\n', 'coffee = $1', 'import java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class CoffeeDriver {\n\n//main method\n    public static void main (String[] args){\n        String[] itemName = {""Coffee, Water, Milk, Donut, Bagel""};\n        double[] itemPrice = {1.00, 2.00, 1.50, 0.75, 1.25};\n        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);\n        String decision;\n\n        System.out.println (""Welcome to Wings Coffee Shop"");\n        System.out.println (""We have a great list of tasty items on our menu."");\n        System.out.println (""Would you like to see these items sorted by"");\n        System.out.println (""name or by price?

I have some background working on web applications (struts, faces), but it's been a few years. I need to develop a set of web services which will be deployed to Websphere 6.1 (Java SDK 1.5). Ideally, I'd like to develop using Eclipse (Indigo SR 1 - Java EE) and test in Tomcat (Tomcat 6). I'm familiar with these tools and have them installed. I'm planning on starting with the contract (WSDL) which I've written in Eclipse. Where should I go from here? I think I need to somehow generate POJOs with JSR 181 annotations. How do I generate them from Eclipse (or should I use a different tool)? What needs to happen so that Tomcat and Websphere will discover the web service classes in my WAR and make them available as web services? I was hoping to find a tutorial to walk me through this, but I'm not really sure what I'm looking for. I suspect that there are many ways to do this.

2278163,Pre populate client database with PhoneGap (primary target Android),"There have been a few articles and questions about how to do this but they all seem to have a bias to iOS. So first of all I am currently using PhoneGaps database functionality: http://docs.phonegap.com/en/1.0.0/phonegap_storage_storage.md.html I have a database I need for the app to run from as it contains a lot of information, probably about 1mb worth (can be exposed as .db/.sql). So I want to be able to make my PhoneGap app and build it for as many platforms as possible. However I want it so that as soon as the user has installed the app it automatically installs the database for them. Some of the solutions seem to recommend creating the database on first boot, but this just seems a bit hack-ish and sidestepping the problem. I am more than happy to switch over to use webSQL if Android, iOS and other providers support it, however as PhoneGap wraps any available native OS DB functionality it seemed more realistic that you can get an app to pre-populate an Android database and access it via PhoneGap than pre-populate a web database and access it via webSql. Hopefully this question makes sense and there have been advances since mid last year, which seems to be the last up to date post on this sort of thing.",[],False

IMHO there is no science that can predict the future without a decent mathematical model, and I think the world of investing lacks said models. Some of the arguments he presented have to do with the sophisticated software models that are used for automated trading. The argument I presented is that all models are wrong (see 2008) and they are just delusional in their science. To settle this, I need to know if there is any falsifiable and repeatable propositions that form the basis of the science for big time, multi-billion dollar bank investing.

2322269,Building sharable ASP.NET MVC UI Components,"We have two websites that share some business processes and UI elements. Lets focus on a contrived example: we have an apartment rental site and a boat exchange. For instance, on our apartment rental website, we may want to let users bid to buy boats. On our boat website, we may want to let users search for apartments. An obvious solution would be to compile the views and controllers into a base project and inherit appropriately. So buying a boat on the apartment site invokes base.mvc which actually contains the veiws for both boats and apartments. So adding a new boat screen would require an apartment site rollout to get the functionality. Another alternative would be to have the apartment site just forward any boatish requests to the boat site(or some boat site) and return appropriate html. This would make the front end sites little more than routing tables and css. Surely some SO member has already had to solve this problem. Can anyone point out the pros and cons of these strategies?

When I added Branch B to git-svn it only tracks back to r6. I was expecting it to wire the Git commit of r6 on Branch B to the Git commit of r5 on Branch A. I attempted , but it didn't work for me in this scenario since it breaks subsequent attempts.

2620867,How could I auto increment a file and have it reset,"I am trying to figure out a way to organize files in a folder with perl. The basis of my script is sort of simple. The script reads the subfolders in the root folder, goes through each folder, and uses a simple comparison of the first 3 digits in the file name to the 3 digit folder name. If they do not match, it puts it into the right place. My problem is that while looking through the files I sometimes run into a duplicate order number. Because the order already exists I cannot overwrite the original, but the two files cannot exist in the same place for obvious reasons. So I had come up with the idea to append the word to the end of the file name in order to move them and they can be renamed later. The problem I am running into now is when I already have two duplicates. I am looking for a way to allow the TEMP tag to increment by 1 everytime it is used and then reset to zero each time the loop starts again. I am just not really sure where I should implement this idea. Here is the main routine for the script: Here is the subroutine that handles the file moving and renaming: Some example filenames look like this: CF100145.pdf CA310244.pdf CL211745.pdf CL211745_1.pdf (This denotes a second page, from our document scanner) ME102103.pdf Where problems occur is when the same job is changed and rather than putting the file where it should go the person places the updated job information into the current job folder, the directory does not match the first 3 numbers in the file. So later they have to be sorted in order to solve errors, the problem is there are over 500,000 documents in just one office and we got 4 offices.","['_TEMP', 'foreach my $office (keys %office_names) {\n\nmake_junk_folder($office);\n\n# The matches and unmatches come back as array references!\nmy ($returned_matches, $returned_unmatches) = read_root_folder($office);\n\nforeach my $folder (@$returned_matches) {\n    my $returned_files = read_subfolder($office, $folder);\n\n    foreach my $file (@$returned_files) {\n        analyze_file($office,$folder,$file);\n    }\n}\n\nforeach my $folder (@$returned_unmatches) {\n    print ""$folder\\n"";\n    remove_root_junk($office,$folder);\n}\n}\n', 'sub analyze_file {\n\n    my $office = shift;\n    my $folder = shift;\n    my $file = shift;\n\n    my $order_docs_path = $office_names{$office};\n\n    if ($file =~ /^(?&lt;office&gt; (C[AFL]|ME)) (?&lt;folder_num&gt; \\d{3})\n                   (?&lt;file_num&gt; \\d{3}) ([_|\\-] \\d+)? \\.

2729057,"Options (--partial, --partial-dir) in rsync don't work as I would expect","I have been trying to figure out how to resume partial transfers in rsync (on Windows, using cygwin) without using the option. I see that rsync creates ""partial"" files in the destination directory with names like .[filename].2dxZ1a, and so, in my understanding, if I used the option, rsync would see a file like this and resume the transfer to this file. But, I'm finding that if I use the option and the rsync process ends, then when I start the rsync command again, it deletes those partial files. Perhaps this option on works on a brief transfer interruption, but not when the process ends and starts over. In addition to this option, I actually liked the option, expecting that if I specifiy (with or without the surrounding quotes), rsync would create the directory .rsync in the destination directory and transfer the files to [dir]/.rsync, moving them to [dir] once the transfer finished (and deleting [dir]/.rsync once it no longer needed it). But, it seems like rsync is completely ignoring that option and just creating its temporary files in the destination directory like normal (and deleting them on re-start). So, I'm wondering: am I doing something wrong or do I just not understand those options correctly?

2733574,Programmatically specifying colours in scale_fill_manual ggplot call,"I want to colour the backgrounds of a ggplot2 facet plot depending on the value given in a particular column. Using answers to previous questions I have already asked, I was able to piece what I needed together. @joran's answer to this question was particularly useful as it illustrates the technique of creating a separate data frame to pass to ggplot. This all works nicely enough, giving the output shown in the following image: Here is the code I used to generate the above plot: The real-world script towards which I am working is intended to be used for many different groups containing many different data series, so this script will be duplicated many times, with only the variables changing. This makes it important to have the user-defined elements clearly accessible for editing, which is why the and variables are put right at the start of the file. (Of course, it would be better not to need to change the script at all but rather define these lists as external files or pass them to the script as arguments.) I tried to generalise the solution by using those two loops to assign the regions. I did fiddle around for a while trying to get a more R-centric solution using functions but couldn't get it to work so I gave up and stuck with what I knew. However, in my code as it stands the call needs to be explicitly passed variables to define fill colours, such as . These variables will vary depending on the data I am processing, so with the script in its current form, I will need to manually edit the ggplot part of the script for each group of data series. I know that would be be time-consuming and I strongly suspect it would also be very prone to errors. Q. Ideally I would like to be able to programmatically extract and define the required values for the call from a previously declared list of values (in this case from ) matched to a previously declared list of colours, but I can't think of a way to achieve this.

2790138,WPF MVVM updating the View Model on a Background Worker,"Is this senerio valid? I have a View to maintain an Item. I have View Model which exposes the Item Object (implements INotifyPropertyChanged) as a Property to which is View is bound. Is it valid for me to pass the Item object to a Backgroundworker where it is modified, then raise the PropertyChanged event when the BackgroundWorking is complete? Or should the BackgroundWorker in no way modify the Item object. I would update the existing Item object with the results passed back by the BackgroundWorker. This would be done in the RunWorkerCompleted event. But does this lock the UI thread and defeat the object of having a backgound worker? Confused? I'll try to explain. The User takes an option to create an Item. I create the View and View Model. In the View model an empty Item object is created. He is presented with a View to maintain the Item. On selecting the Item Type property, this instigates a complex process to create a list of proerties to be entered by the User. I could block the UI thread whilst the list is created but this gives a poor user experience. I want to pass the processing to a background thread while keeping the UI alive. At present, I set a flag to indicate the section on the View is loading, pass the Item object to the BackgroundWorker which updates the observable collection of Properties. When the BackgroundWorking is complete I call the PropertyChanged event which updates the section of the View which is bound to the list and turn off the flag to indicate the section is loading. This seems to work with no issues. But I have a gut feeling that I should not be updating bound onjects from the View Model in a background thread. Thanks Tim",[],False

I am using Office 2007 w/ VS 2008, and i'm coding against the Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word library, which seems to work with either 2003 or 2008.

I've tried a couple different methods: 1) using the bool Shape.TextFrame.Overflowing property however, this returns TRUE even though when I open the document I can see the text fits in the box. 2) checking the X/Y position of the last character of the text, and seeing if that coordinate falls within the textbox boundaries however, this returns X/Y that are almost always inside the box, though when I open the document I can't see the character because it doesn't fit in the box. So I'm running out of ideas here, and i'm asking if anybody else has gone through this before and if they have suggestions for dealing with the inaccurate mess that is the word interop?","['while (textbox.TextFrame.Overflowing) // adjust font size\n', 'lastCharX = System.Convert.ToSingle (tb.TextFrame.TextRange.Characters.Last.get_Information (WdInformation.wdHorizontalPositionRelativeToPage));\nlastCharY = System.Convert.ToSingle (tb.TextFrame.TextRange.Characters.Last.get_Information (WdInformation.wdVerticalPositionRelativeToPage));\nbool outsideFrameBoundaries = lastCharX + lastCharWidth &gt; frameBoundaryX || lastCharY + lastCharHeight &gt; frameBoundaryY;\n']",False
2885126,CSS Box-Shadow Animation Technique?,"So I've been doing a ton of skulking around on CodePen and have found a lot of awesome demos, particularly on the CSS front. What I'm seeing consistently on the CSS front though is often utilizing the box-shadow property to produce crazy looking animations/graphics, this is an example of what I'm talking about.

2903258,Examples of fields of characteristic 0?,"I was preparing for an area exam in analysis and came across a problem in the book Real Analysis by Haaser &amp; Sullivan. From p.34 Q 2.4.3, If the field F is isomorphic to the subset S' of F', show that S' is a subfield of F'. I would appreciate any hints on how to solve this problem as I'm stuck, but that's not my actual question. I understand that for finite fields this implies that two sets of the same cardinality must have the same field structure, if any exists. The classification of finite fields answers the above question in a constructive manner. What got me curious is the infinite case. Even in the finite case it's surprising to me that the field axioms are so ""restrictive"", in a sense, that alternate field structures are simply not possible on sets of equal cardinality. I then started looking for examples of fields with characteristic zero while thinking about this problem. I didn't find many. So far, I listed the rationals, algebraic numbers, real numbers, complex numbers and the p-adic fields. What are other examples? Is there an analogous classification for fields of characteristic zero?",[],False

2989276,Fixed points of coset operation,"Let $G$ be a finite group which operates on two finite sets $E_1$ and $E_2$. Say that $E_1$ and $E_2$ are weakly $G$-isomorphic if for every $g \in G$, $\mathrm{Card}(E_1^g)=\mathrm{Card}(E_2^g)$, with $E^g$ the set of points fixed by $g$. An equivalent definition is : for every $g$ there exists a bijection $f_g : E_1 \to E_2$ such that $f_g(gx_1)=gf_g(x_1)$ (for every $x_1 \in E_1$) (this is not obvious but not difficult either). I would like to prove that if $H_1,H_2$ are subgroups of $G$, then the $G$-sets $G/H_1$ and $G/H_2$ are weakly $G$-isomorphic iif for every conjugacy class $C$ in $G$, $\mathrm{Card}(C \cap H_1) = \mathrm{Card}(C \cap H_2)$. Now for $xH \in G/H$ to be a fixed point of $g$, a necessary and sufficient condition is that $x^{-1}gx \in H$. We can't define a mapping $xH \mapsto x^{-1}gx \in C \cap H$, because if $xH=yH$ there is no reason for $x^{-1}gx$ to be the same as $y^{-1}gy$. But we can map the fixed point $xH$ to the set of $h^{-1}x^{-1}gxh$, i.e. the conjugacy class of $x^{-1}gx$ for $H$ (note that $H$ operates on $C \cap H$ by conjugation). I've been playing around with this kind of things for quite some time but eventually didn't succeed in construction a bijection from $C \cap H_1$ onto $C \cap H_2$, assuming $G/H_1$ and $G/H_2$ are weakly $G$-isomorphic.

2994034,Replacing fields in WordML,"There is a system that I support that generates Word documents based on a template. The original approach that I used was saving the document template as a Word 2003 XML file, and inserting special tags into the document such as %TEST%, etc. The problem I found with this was that word error checking often split up the tags, which meant that I had to manually edit the XML. To get around this, I decided to switch to an approach where I put fields that reference custom document properties. I used XML manipulation and XPath to replace the tags that fields are mostly put in. However, some fields (mainly those that are formatted differently), use a series of tags with special elements in them: It's replacing these tags that are proving to be difficult. How would I go about replacing all these elements into one single run: I am using C# 4.0. Alternatively, is there a better approach to the whole thing?","['&lt;w:r&gt;\n  &lt;w:rPr&gt;\n    &lt;w:bdr w:val=""single"" w:sz=""4"" wx:bdrwidth=""10"" w:space=""0"" w:color=""auto""/&gt;\n  &lt;/w:rPr&gt;\n  &lt;w:fldChar w:fldCharType=""begin""/&gt;\n&lt;/w:r&gt;\n&lt;w:r&gt;\n  &lt;w:rPr&gt;\n    &lt;w:bdr w:val=""single"" w:sz=""4"" wx:bdrwidth=""10"" w:space=""0"" w:color=""auto""/&gt;\n  &lt;/w:rPr&gt;\n  &lt;w:instrText&gt; DOCPROPERTY  InstitutionName  \\* MERGEFORMAT &lt;/w:instrText&gt;\n&lt;/w:r&gt;\n&lt;w:r&gt;\n  &lt;w:rPr&gt;\n    &lt;w:bdr w:val=""single"" w:sz=""4"" wx:bdrwidth=""10"" w:space=""0"" w:color=""auto""/&gt;\n  &lt;/w:rPr&gt;\n  &lt;w:fldChar w:fldCharType=""separate""/&gt;\n&lt;/w:r&gt;\n&lt;w:proofErr w:type=""spellStart""/&gt;\n&lt;w:r&gt;\n  &lt;w:rPr&gt;\n    &lt;w:bdr w:val=""single"" w:sz=""4"" wx:bdrwidth=""10"" w:space=""0"" w:color=""auto""/&gt;\n  &lt;/w:rPr&gt;\n  &lt;w:t&gt;InstitutionName&lt;/w:t&gt;\n&lt;/w:r&gt;\n&lt;w:proofErr w:type=""spellEnd""/&gt;\n&lt;w:r&gt;\n  &lt;w:rPr&gt;\n    &lt;w:bdr w:val=""single"" w:sz=""4"" wx:bdrwidth=""10"" w:space=""0"" w:color=""auto""/&gt;\n  &lt;/w:rPr&gt;\n  &lt;w:fldChar w:fldCharType=""end""/&gt;\n&lt;/w:r&gt;\n', '&lt;w:r&gt;\n  &lt;w:rPr&gt;\n    &lt;w:bdr w:val=""single"" w:sz=""4"" wx:bdrwidth=""10"" w:space=""0"" w:color=""auto""/&gt;\n  &lt;/w:rPr&gt;\n  &lt;w:t&gt;InstitutionName&lt;/w:t&gt;\n&lt;/w:r&gt;\n']",False

3009549,How to set a static route for an external IP address,"I'm putting a new router on our network to help manage our private network connections and to better control routing to the outside. I've decided to simplify this question by removing references to a second private network on our router (but please be aware that there are reasons for this question so the answer is not to leave the old router the default gateway). I have the following routing in my iptables on our router: This configuration means that users will be forwarded through a modem/router that has a public address - this is all well and good for most purposes, and in the main it doesn't matter that all computers are hidden behind the one public IP. However, some users need to be able to access a proxy at 192.111.222.111:8080 - and the proxy needs to identify this traffic as coming through a gateway at 129.2.2.126 (the old router) - it won't respond otherwise. I tried adding a static route on our router with: I can successfully ping 192.111.222.111 from the router. When I trace the route, it lists the 129.2.2.126 gateway, but I just get * on each of the following hops (I think this makes sense since this is just a web-proxy and requires authentication). When I try to ping this address from a host on the 129.2.2.0/25 network it fails. Should I do this in the iptables chain instead? How would I configure this routing? Network diagram Here is the interfaces configuration for the router: And here is the routing table (without my static route added): To restate - I want traffic from 129.2.2.7 (for example) to now route through our router (129.2.2.125). But this router needs to then forward 8080 requests with the destination of 192.111.222.111 - which is somewhere the other side of the old router (129.2.2.126 - which is not manageable by us).","[""# Allow established connections, and those !not! coming from the public interface\n# eth0 = public interface\n# eth1 = private interface #1 (129.2.2.0/25)\niptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT\niptables -A INPUT -m state --state NEW ! -i eth0 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o eth1 -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT\n\n# Allow outgoing connections from the private interface\niptables -A FORWARD -i eth1 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT\n\n# Masquerade (NAT)\niptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE\n\n# Don't forward any other traffic from the public to the private\niptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o eth1 -j REJECT\n"", 'route add -host 192.111.222.111 gw 129.2.2.126 dev eth1\n', 'auto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n    address     150.1.2.2\n    netmask     255.255.255.248\n    gateway     150.2.2.1\n\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet static\n    address     129.2.2.125\n    netmask     255.255.255.128\n', 'Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface\ndefault         eth1202.sa.adsl 0.0.0.0         UG    100    0        0 eth0\nlocalnet        *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth1\n129.2.2.0       *               255.255.255.128 U     0      0        0 eth1\n']",False

Also, are there any killer apps for making this easy to administer and set up (as a Windows file server, in particular - this answer is a good example)? Would FreeNAS be sufficient?

3206303,how to install a global keyboard handler for Java App,"Possible Duplicate: Event listener in Java without app having focus? (Global keypress detection) I have an application written in Java and I would like to install a truly global keyboard handler. For instance, I want Ctrl+Alt+Whatever to translate into a ""New Document"" command in my app. This should happen even if my app does not have focus or is minimized to the system tray.

3401210,Exclude setup.dll from Smart Cab Project in VS2008,"I have added some custom actions to our installer which is run on CE5 and WM6. This installer works fine and builds fine. There is however one annoyance. The setup.dll is deployed to the device and this file is not necessary. I've read several websites on creating a setup.dll file, MSDN and even the mobile SDK. They all state the same set of steps. Create your C++ dll project. Ensure the output is called setup.dll. On your cab project click on CE Setup DLL, browse, application folder, add output and select your setup project. (You cannot select a local directory, its always a directory on the target machine) Now this does work and produce a custom cab installer. However as mentioned the setup.dll is copied across into the application folder, even though it is not required after installation (not even for the uninstall) I tried to exclude the setup.dll by setting exclude to true in its properties. All this does is not include the file a all so the cab files to build as the setup.dll is missing. As such the only solution i have arrived at is manually changing the cab .inf the file from to Where Files.Common4 pointed to the setup.dll file locally on the machine. Doing this change means it is used to build the cab file, but the file is not copied across. Is there anyway of doing this change in visual studio, or is it always going to be a manual edit of the .inf file and the a manual build of the cab file with cabwiz.exe?","['[DefaultInstall]\nCEShortcuts=Shortcuts\nAddReg=RegKeys\nCopyFiles=Files.Common1,Files.Common2,Files.Common3,Files.Common4\nCESetupDLL=""Setup.dll""\n', '[DefaultInstall]\nCEShortcuts=Shortcuts\nAddReg=RegKeys\nCopyFiles=Files.Common1,Files.Common2,Files.Common3\nCESetupDLL=""Setup.dll""\n']",False

3528551,best practice to use EventBus with GWT components,"Say I have a component C that is being used in 2 places in my application. For example, I have a list of folders that are being displayed in 2 tabs. When user renames a folder in one part, this change should be reflected in the other as well. I'm thinking to use EventBus for this and make the folders component to fire an EventBus event, say FolderChangedEvent. This event will be intercepted by the second folder component which will automatically update it's folder list. The question is that if I want at some point to use this Folder component in a 3-rd place, this place will also have the folder list updated. This might not be a desired behavior of the application. Normally, I'd make the Folder component have an own addFolderChangedHandler(...) method but since this component is quite complex and has sub-components, this might create spaghetti-type of code. However, I don't feel like this component should contain any application-specific logic and throw events directly in the application's EventBus which is a big too high-level for it. What is the best practice for this case and how do you efficiently use EventBus?",[],False

Literature suggests rightly that the source and target partitions must be umounted to be able to get a clean clone. This assumes that you need to use a LiveCD.

In other words, at a high level a system with 3 partitions (all bootable): Rescue Partition (LiveCD emulation) Running Partition (Source) Backup Partition (Destination) When it's time to clone the source partition to the backup (destination) partition, we would boot to the rescue partition, unmount the other 2 partitions (is it required?), run disk check on the source, copy to the destination (dd or simple copy to avoid replicating the defragmentation from the source), run disk check on the destination partition, update Grub menu list to force boot from either partition, and reboot into that partition. My question, is it an approach that you'd recommend? MBR in all this? Any gotchas or extra checks required? Thanks, D.",[],False

This operation would return the value associated with a key/query if that value exists or block until that value is created. It's like a pub/sub message queue but with a memory to handle the case when the subscriber connects after the publisher has published the result. This operation allows unrelated processes to rendezvous with each other, and it seems that it would be a very useful architectural building block to have - especially in a web environment - i.e. a web request comes in which kicks off a backend server process to do some work and the web client can get the results via a future AJAX call.

3725767,C# windows form Deleting records from dataGridView and DB file,I am trying to delete the data from my gridview and from the DB file. The following removes the data from the gridview and DB. It only partially works my explanation below! I then added the following to delete the record from the db: The issue i face is that in the DB there is an ID field that auto increments. When i select the first entry for example via a checkbox which is in the first column and remove it on the datagridview it also removes the row from the DB. However then if i re-populate the datagridview after deletion the DB will have the record with ID 1 deleted but the datagrid numbers itself from 0 again. So if i want to delete the new first row in the datagridview it will remove it from the dataviewgrid but because ID 1 no longer exists in the DB file it find nothing to remove. I understand why it's doing it the simplicity of the delete statement does not take into the account that the datagrid and the db use different rows and different id's and i am trying to mash them together using that variable. Unfortunately i can't figure out how to make them work together correctly. Any help would be appreciated please!

3806909,Design of common featureset - splitting data and code,"I am new to Perl programming and would like to get some ideas on what is the best way to structure a piece of code in the form of Perl module(s). It should provide a framework such that the 'data' can grow/shrink without impacting the code. Essentially, the program needs to perform 3 different things ('data' portion): Gather text from multiple files(entire text) depending upon which RPM (RPM name = 'A', 'B', 'C' respectively, for argument's sake) is installed on the host. The list of files will grow and should be stored in a simple externalized file which should be easily editable. Run OS commands on the operating system (Linux) and capture the output of the commands into a text file, depending upon which RPM (RPM name = 'A', 'B', 'C', for argument's sake) is installed on the host. Run Database commands on a specific database (lets call it 'DBA', 'DBB', 'DBC', 3 databases corresponding to 3 hosts) and capture the output to a text file, depending upon which RPM (RPM name = 'A', 'B', 'C' respectively, for argument's sake) is installed on the host. I need to program the logic in such a way that: There has to be a ""RPM to file/command/DB-command"" mapping which is easily editable separately from the main Perl program The number of files, their names/location + OS + DB commands is expected to change and therefore should be easily editable separately from the main Perl program The RPM name and the mapping to the above data can change and therefore should be easily editable separately from the main Perl program Ideas that I have researched so far: Hash of Hashes (in a Perl module) Array of Arrays (in a Perl module) external XML external Key-value pair file Any guidance on whats the easiest and simplest way to go about doing this?

3837941,SVN Server stopped working properly (403 Forbidden),"Ok, first of all, I've already googled a lot about this problem, but didn't found any solution... I've searched here and on ServerFault, but didn't found anything, so I end up posting this question here (don't really sure if it goes here or in ServerFault, sorry). So here's the deal: We have a Windows 2003 Server running without problems. We have been using Visual SVN Server as our Subversion server and it worked great until now. We take some vacations for a couple of weeks so we didn't use the SVN at all. Today, when I tried to commit something I got: Server sent unexpected return value (403 Forbidden) in response to OPTIONS request for [repository url] We use TortoiseSVN as our svn client, but the problem seems to be on the server. We tried creating a new repository and import new files, same error. We tried accessing the SVN server from the server itself through RDC and trying to checkout something by console (svn checkout) and others commands too.... everything leads to that error. Some people said it was a case-sensitive problem on the URL... but that's not our case... I've double-checked the URLs and they are fine... (anyway they were stored on the Tortoise history, so that didn't change). One particular point to say is that there are people out there having the same problem that are not using Visual SVN (which is really just a easy way to set up a Subversion server in 2 clicks, it's not something different from any Subversion server). So I don't know if the problem is actually the Visual SVN itself. We're lost... Any helpful information will be really appreciated. EDIT/SOLUTION: I had a wrong entry on the authz file. It was trying to give permission to a deleted group (I think VisualSVN didn't delete the entry on authz but it did delete the group), so I deleted the entry and it's working now. Thank you",[],False

There are hardware solutions (using programable DSP chips), but I'm curious whether a real-time linux task could handle the entire problem. The task is simple: read a sample from the A/D board, perform some simple arithmetic and write a sample to the A/D board. Can RT Linux schedule this task 40k times/second or is that an unreasonable speed? If we can perform the periodic task on the CPU, we can write the app without a hardware dependency. If not, we'll have to use a hybrid CPU/DSP system. Obviously, I'm hoping for the former.",[],False

I'd like to do this for up to 10 total text fields (max). Can someone help me to accomplish this or point me to a nice tutorial on how to do this? EDIT 7/10/12 @ 11:30AM I've been working on this and so far I can get the text fields to show up. However I have a few issues... When pressing the ""Save Config"" button, none of the values entered in these dynamically created textfields actually save. Is there a way to limit how many text fields actually save? I'm unsure of the correct way to retrieve the text field(s) data. This is mostly due to the fact that I cannot save the values...(I will add another update after #1 is fixed if I need help with this...) My System.xml file has this in it (directly related to this)..

This drives me nuts since I use alt-tab quite a lot, but occasionally will mistakenly hit alt on its own, requiring me to strike it again to toggle back to regular keyboard input instead of menu shortcuts.

4493016,How to manage multiple versions of the same record,"I am doing short-term contract work for a company that is trying to implement a check-in/check-out type of workflow for their database records. Here's how it should work... A user creates a new entity within the application. There are about 20 related tables that will be populated in addition to the main entity table. Once the entity is created the user will mark it as the master. Another user can make changes to the master only by ""checking out"" the entity. Multiple users can checkout the entity at the same time. Once the user has made all the necessary changes to the entity, they put it in a ""needs approval"" status. After an authorized user reviews the entity, they can promote it to master which will put the original record in a tombstoned status. The way they are currently accomplishing the ""check out"" is by duplicating the entity records in all the tables. The primary keys include EntityID + EntityDate, so they duplicate the entity records in all related tables with the same EntityID and an updated EntityDate and give it a status of ""checked out"". When the record is put into the next state (needs approval), the duplication occurs again. Eventually it will be promoted to master at which time the final record is marked as master and the original master is marked as dead. This design seems hideous to me, but I understand why they've done it. When someone looks up an entity from within the application, they need to see all current versions of that entity. This was a very straightforward way for making that happen. But the fact that they are representing the same entity multiple times within the same table(s) doesn't sit well with me, nor does the fact that they are duplicating EVERY piece of data rather than only storing deltas. I would be interested in hearing your reaction to the design, whether positive or negative. I would also be grateful for any resoures you can point me to that might be useful for seeing how someone else has implemented such a mechanism. Thanks! Darvis",[],False

4620107,What design pattern to use for a threaded queue,"I have a very complex system (100+ threads) which need to send email without blocking. My solution to the problem was to implement a class called which is started at the beginning of execution and has a 0 it empties it. While this is going on there's a synchronized static method called which accepts an email containing body,subject..etc as an array. The system does work, and my other threads can move on after adding their email to queue without blocking or even worrying if the email was successfully sent...it just seems to be a little messy...or hackish...Every programmer gets this feeling in their stomach when they know they're doing something wrong or there's a better way. That said, can someone slap me on the wrist and suggest a more efficient way to accomplish this? Thanks!","['EmailQueueSender', 'ScheduledExecutorService', 'addEmailToQueue(String[])']",False

4669868,MVC2 and two different models using same controller method? Possible?,"I don't know if this is the right way of doing this or not, but I am using Jquery and MVC2. I am using a the $.ajax method to make a call back to a controller to do some business logic on a .blur of a textbox. I have two views that basically do the same thing with the common data, but are using different models. They both use the same controller. It might be easier to explain with code: So here are the two models: There are two views that are strongly typed to these models. One is RecordModel, the other SecondaryModel.

However, the SecondaryModel view also tries to call this function, and it fails because it's expecting the RecordModel and not the SecondaryModel. So my question is this. How can two different strongly typed views use the same Action in a controller and still adhering to the modeling pattern?

I of course could plug in numbers but I don't think this is the best way to do this. for part c) I know that I am only concerned with the nlog(5n^2) = 2nlog(5n) which is in the same complexity class as nlog(n). Now nlogn is the dominating term in T(n) and is less then that of 1000000(log(5n^2)), but I could also multiply the nlogn by some constant C such that it is always bigger, thus it is Big-Theta.

The doctype information is in the source document, I want to keep exactly that doctype information and not provide it again from within my code. If a document has no DocType, I won't add one. I do not care about the form or content of these files at all, except for my few nodes. custom EntityResolvers or StreamFilters to omit or otherwise manipulate the source information (It is already a pity that namespace information seems somehow inaccessible from the document file where it is declared, but I can manage by using uglier XPaths) DTD validation. I don't have the referenced DTDs, I don't want to include them and Node manipulation is perfectly possible without knowing about them. The aim is to have the source file entirely unchanged except for the changed Nodes, which are retrieved via XPath. I would like to get away with the standard javax.xml stuff. My progress so far: This loads the XML source into a org.w3c.dom.Document successfully, ignoring DTD validation. I can do my replacements and then I use to write it back. Which is nearly perfect.

I've got a Win 2008 R2 server and 5 monitors stationed throughout an office. These are just NEC Monitors with VGA/DVI (they may have hdmi but I'm not sure) inputs; definitely nothing fancy so DLNA is not an option (although I wish it was!) I do NOT have a ton of AV knowledge and am trying to learn quickly. I have attempted to use Ethernet to DVI Baluns to achieve the desired result. I can get 2 remote monitors to use a 'combined desktop' and display video in fullscreen with a surprisingly good result. I don't think windows will 'combine desktop' on more than 2 monitors however, and I need to have all 5 monitors displaying the same video. The video playing will range from simple powerpoint presentations to active video of triathlons. I have tried UltraMon with little success - the mirroring of displays just doesn't work fluidly enough to provide a good picture on high action videos. Client/Server solutions such as MaxiVista are out as well because the monitors I want to stream the video to are just dumb monitors - no PC attached.

5012577,Inserting UTF-8 characters into database via BPEL process,"We have a BPEL process that is taking characters (e.g. Chinese) and attempts to insert them into an NVARCHAR column.

5028568,How can I create an auto-populated menu that is automatically assigned to a location?,"I'm trying to add BuddyPress nav menu support to my theme and, unfortunately, BP's template tags still aren't fully up to snuff. (Basically, if you're not making an explicit child theme for the BP Default theme, you've got to reinvent several wheels.) So what I'd like to do is Detect when BP is active (I know how to do this) Register a menu position when BP is active (also a known quantity) Create a default menu containing links to the BP sections (this is where the hole in my knowledge exists) Assign said default menu to the newly-registered position So, essentially, with my theme active, if a user activates BuddyPress, they'll automatically get a menu with Members, Forums, Activity, etc. and it will be displayed to a position, but if users wanted to override the menu, they would be free to do so. Thoughts? EDIT 1 Bainternet wins the prize. Here's what I did, slightly modified from his solution: I conditionally registered a menu location I then conditionally hooked in a call to the menu setup Then, last of all, I actually registered the menu","[""if( function_exists( 'bp_get_loggedin_user_nav' ) ){\n    register_nav_menu( 'lblgbpmenu', 'Default BuddyPress Menu' );\n}\n"", ""if( function_exists( 'bp_get_loggedin_user_nav' ) ){\n    add_action( 'widgets_init', 'lblg_add_default_buddypress_menu' );\n}\n"", ""function lblg_add_default_buddypress_menu(){\n    global $lblg_themename;\n    $menuname = $lblg_themename .

I don't know what the guy from the article did to make it work. I've read on google that you need to place (and rename) the in the same directory as the program that you want to run the proxy dll with, but I am looking for a global solution.

As I don't have pretty much experience, I wonder if it's working correctly. I use PersistentTokenApproach (with my own implementation, because I use Hibernate.) I can see the cookie is created on login and deleted on logout. If I have an valid Remember-Me-Cookie and close the Browser, Im successfully logged in again when I open the browser again. So far, so good. Now, I'd just like to know if those things I noticed are working as they are expected to or if I maybe did make a mistake. 1) When a user logs in without remember-me and the browser-tab is closed (not the browser itself), on reopening a new browser-tab he is still authenticated (he's using the same JSESSIONID). When closing the browser and reopening again, he isn't authenticated anymore. Regarding the security of a webapplication, is this a recommended (""normal"") behaviour? 2) When remember-me used and the user is successfully authenticated (by login or later by cookie), there are no more checks on the cookie. that means, if meanwhile the user is online I'd delete the cookie from the database, the user would still be logged in, allowed to watch even the secured pages. I guess this happens because he was authenticated before and keeps using the same SESSIONID. When I close the browser and reopen it again, he isn't authenticated anymore. 3) When I dont own a cookie and open the main page, for every request I send (every picture, every file on the page) the server is checking for the rememberme-cookie. Is that correct? Sorry for the newbie-questions, but I just want to make sure everything is working as it should. :-) Thanks in advance!",[],False

There are 17 (at the moment) tables with identical structure - name, address, phone number. Given a phone number, I have to check to see if there's a matching entry in any of the tables, then return that address. So, I created a view to get the list of tables (there's a ref table that holds that info), then I created a stored procedure to create a temp table, using cursors, check each table in the view for the phone number, using sql concatenation. If a record is found, insert it into the temp table. return the rows from the temp table. This all works in straight T-SQL. Now, I'm trying to use Entity Framework 4+ to call the stored procedure. But the function import interface won't generate columns. It says return type = none, and the LINQ code expects an int and won't compile. Any ideas on how to make this work?

Since my local .gitignore was still ignoring those files, my local repo didn't think I had local working files to add to the index. I ended up deleting all the files and then the pull worked and brought them all in. I'm definitely going to be more careful editing the .gitignore file and checking it in.

My question is this; how should my service expose these related data? Let me furthe define the problem.

I am trying to decide between these two approaches: Option One Option Two I am leaning toward Option One, simply because it would make pagination on the client much easier, by simply having the client request additional related records.

5428765,How to write properly a nested form with a N-N relation,"While working on Rails 3 app, I came to the problem of nested forms. One collection is a set of predefined objects (created with db:seed). The other collection should show a form to allow to choose a few elements. An example is better than a long description, so here it is. Suppose you have 2 models: User and Group. Suppose there are a few groups: Member, Admins, Guests, ... You want your users to have multiple groups, and so you need a intermediate table: memberships. The model code is obvious: The controller should not need to be changed. The view, however is more complicated. I want to show a list of checkboxes to choose a few groups of the predefined ones. I am using here the special field, with reversed value, to destroy when it is actually unchecked (and so add the user to the group when it is checked) However, this do not work as expected, because the form will always create an input with an arbitrary id after each group (and even break the layout by including it after the ): Knowing the syntax of nested attributes is the following: Sending every time the id will not work, because it will try to update a record which does not exist instead of creating it, and try to destroy when the record does not exist. The current solution I found is to remove all the ids, which are wrong anyway (they should be the ids of the memberships, instead of simple indexes), and add the real id when the user already has the group. (this is called in the controller before create and update) This seems so wrong, and it adds a lot of logic in the controller, just to control the bad behavior of the view helper.

5434244,Booting from shared root over network?,"I have multiple systems in my home network that are running Linux Mint. I also have a NAS server hooked to the home network, which already serves the various user's home directories (so no matter which machine you use, you always have ""your"" home directory available). I also have a Raspberry Pi, which I successfully made to boot its root filesystem from the NAS instead of the SD card. That latter experience made me wonder, if it would be possible to have the multiple Linux Mint machines share a common root installation on the network? I.e., install Linux to a NAS server share, then net-booting that installation from my various machines. I've done this for one machine already (the Pi), and am wondering if such an installation could be shared, so I would have to administrate / update only that one installation. I see several problems, from over to potential concurrency issues, and wonder if this can be done, if it has be done before, issues I should be aware of (like, which system directories should not be shared but reside on local mounts), and if there might even be some how-to / caveats articles available on the web.

Here is my code In my code, I used to call the ""isConnected"" method in order to check the connectivity status, before asking my server for data. In the method, I am checking the hostReachability first of all. My thinking behind doing this is to save the computation time. If the hostReachability returns true it implies netConnectivity is also there(no need to verify). So here we are done with just one computation. If the hostReachability returns false, then I am checking is it the net connectivity thats responsible for it. Hence two computations. But it usually seen that the code first verifies the netConnectivity, if its ok, then verify the hostReachability.

5445535,Highlighting unmatched brackets in vim,"I'm getting burned repeatedly by unmatched parentheses while writing python code in vim. I like how they're handled for C code - vim highlights in red all of the curly braces following the unmatched paren. I looked at the syntax file briefly to try to understand it, but the section that handles bracket errors is very complex. Can anyone explain how that code works and suggest how I might write something similar for python code? Example C code with unmatched parens: Since python code doesn't have curly braces to highlight, we'll have to choose something else (perhaps other parentheses). BTW, I tried out this vim plugin but I wasn't happy with the behavior. Edit: I'm using python to generate C++ code (a language that likes parentheses and semicolons). I have a nasty habit of leaving the trailing paren off a method call. It would be nice if I could get vim to make that mistake more visually obvious. Update: Ok, here's what I've tried so far. Unfortunately, all this does is highlight as an error the right paren of all balanced parentheses, the opposite of what I want to do.

I'm working on a fairly JavaScript heavy project with a few other developers from various non-web programming backgrounds and we've decided to try and use public and private methods and properties in our JavaScript psuedo-classes purely as a good coding practice (ie. we know theres no actual advantage or security in it) We've toyed with a few different ways of doing public &amp; private (ie. using locally scoped variables and functions with privileged methods for public consumption) and we've currently settled on having our JavaScript class constructors actually return an object that represents only their public interface, effectively hiding everything else. Here's an example: Which when instantiated and logged in Chrome: Outputs: Now to my question: Because were returning the public interface from the constructor as new object, when you console.log you'll notice that it identifies itself as - whereas if we don't return that public interface it is identified as .

5666275,Debugging file handle issues in c#/.NET,"I have a program that in turn accesses a DLL. It uses files in various ways, creating them, copying them and establishing them as attachments to an emailMessage object. I have a 'file in use' error, preventing overwrite of a file. Is there any tool or technique for easing the process - eg some kind of warning of the creation / removal of handles containing a particular string? I've looked at process explorer, process monitor (the successor to filemon) etc but no luck. I can keep hunting, but thought there might be a better approach than continuing my informal investigations through the code. EDIT Thanks for the comments. Regarding the questions, the structure is a bit complex. I have my 'client' app which references an 'Engine' dll (in C# also). Both are my own. The client creates instances of 'attachments' each of which contain a file reference to various files. The constructor of that grabs the file referred to, and puts a copy in a temporary folder. Later, a set of 'actions' builds the email - it adds each attachment as a 'real' attachment to an EmailMessage object. At various times I dispose of the objects and set their references to null, but if I do it too early then I end up with null reference exceptions. If I do it too late, the damn things are in use! I'm sure I can hunt down this specific bug in due course, but it prompted me to wonder if there is a useful standard method used by those in the know. :)",[],False

5821175,Is it possible to set up parallel transactions in JTA (Atomikos),"I have two transactional resources, database and message queue. So I use Atomikos as the XA transaction manager. Inside a transaction (tx1), is it possible to open another separated transaction (tx2) in parallel? In tx2, it will commit some data into db, even the tx1 might be failed and roll backed eventually. And tx2 must be done inside tx1, as if error occurred in tx2 should roll back the tx1 also. Anyone knows how I can achieve this? Thank you.",[],False

5934157,Can I disable automatic relationships in Entity Framework Code First?,"I noticed that Entity Framework still has a lot of ""automagical"" features in their latest release. As always, this is a truly double-edged sword. Specifically, I'm using the OnModelBuilder event to create my model on the fly in code using the fluentAPI (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh295844(v=vs.103).aspx). I have a large set of entities, and they don't all comply with the Microsoft ""standards"". For example, my ID columns are named Person_id instead of PersonId. As such, Entity doesn't always auto-detect the primary key on a table, or at least, it doesn't seem to do so. I don't mind being explicit when building the model, but what does trouble me is that I'm not always sure what properties and relationships Entity will auto-detect and which ones it will erroneously ignore or misidentify. Since most of my entities also have a partial class with helper methods and properties (stuff to handle enums, etc), I greatly fear that someday Entity will auto create mappings between things which shouldn't be mapped (the failure could be Entity or some unsuspecting programmer). Is there a way I can disable Entity's auto-relationship-hookup feature so that I can be 100% explicit in my OnModelBuilder method? Or, at minimum, how can I know when I need to add extra mapping details (like needing to declare a field optional, or when a specific navigation property won't be autodetected)? Thanks!",[],False

EDIT: This is what I came up with for a temp fix, by looking up the application view from the App.Router.router object.. obviously it's a dirty hack, anyone know the best &amp; right way to do it in pre4?","[""  var controller = App.MyController.create();\n  controller.content = [...];\n\n  App.get('router').get('applicationController').connectOutlet({\n    outletName: 'modal',\n    controller: controller,\n    viewClass: App.MyView,\n    context: controller\n  });\n"", ""  var controller = App.MyController.create();\n  controller.content = this.get('content');\n\n  var theView = App.MyView.create();\n  theView.set('controller', controller);\n\n  App.Router.router.currentHandlerInfos[0].handler.router._activeViews.application[0].connectOutlet('modal', theView);\n""]",False

It seems that for attachments (images, specifically), Wordpress generates the HTML automatically and it looks something like this: I understand that some of these attributes can be changed in the editing screen itself - however I want to change the default HTML code structure so that I can insert additional tags, CSS classes etc. I need a method to achieve this without editing any files outside the wp-content folder - in other words, there must be a template-based way to do this.. any ideas?","['&lt;div id=""attachment_12"" class=""wp-caption alignleft"" style=""width: 310px""&gt;\n&lt;a rel=""shadowbox"" href=""http://new.michaellane.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/areamapchange.png""&gt;\n&lt;img class=""size-medium wp-image-12 "" title=""Area Map Improvments"" src=""http://new.michaellane.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/areamapchange-300x179.png"" alt=""Area Map Improvments"" width=""300"" height=""179"" /&gt;\n&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;p class=""wp-caption-text""&gt;Area Map Improvments&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n']",False
