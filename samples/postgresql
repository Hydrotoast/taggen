IsN`t it just saying that the properties of var merge are the same i.e. ""name"" = ""name"" and ""city"" = ""city""? 3) In the second assert, he says ""the city has been copied over"". Could he have also said, for the first assert, ""the name has been copied over""? ie. the same thing happens in the function to the ""name"" as the ""city"", correct? Or to put it another way, he could have said in both asserts ""the original name is intact"" ""the original city is intact""--namely, that they both underwent the same process? 4) Looking at the title of this example, ""Using a variable number of arguments to our advantage,"" how does this example show that we can use a variable number of arguments to our advantage? Is it simply the fact that all the arguments get stored in ""arguments"" and can then be traversed as an array?","['Variable Number of Arguments To Our Advantage.', 'root[key] = arguments[i][key];', 'root[key] = arguments[i][key];  What exactly is the code doing in this line?

66809,Inaccurate progress bar when uploading large files using ASP.NET and Uploadify?,"I've got an ASP.NET web application (utilizing WebForms) and am using Uploadify to handle uploading large files. This is done by posting the file to an HttpHandler. Example of code (simplified for demonstration purposes): The HttpHandler that receives the file is fairly simple: The problem is that the progress bar being displayed doesn't actually reflect the progress of the upload, and shows the upload as being complete long before the file is actually uploaded. Therefore, the user interface effectively appears like it is doing nothing while the progress bar stays at 100%, until the file is complete. In some cases, the upload simply fails after reaching 100%, with the OnComplete event never getting fired, almost like the response from the HttpHandler is getting lost in transit, even though the file is saved. I've tried both Flajaxian and SWFUpload, and experienced similar issues with the progress bar being completely out of sync with actual upload progress, indicating completion well before the upload was actually complete. This problem is not apparent when testing locally, or with small files (typically under a few megabytes) as these tend to upload fairly quickly and there's little or no lag between the file being uploaded and the progress bar completing. Is there any way of using a Flash upload solution (such as Uploadify) with an ASP.NET web application and have the progress bar better represent the actual progress of the upload? Update: Eventually, I gave up trying to use a flash based uploader as they seemed a bit too awkward, especially the progress bar, which didn't represent the actual progress of the upload at all. Replaced this with Brettle NeatUpload instead which works much better.","['$("".uploadify"").uploadify({\n    \'uploader\': \'/uploadify/uploadify.swf\',\n    \'script\': \'SaveUploadedFile.ashx\',\n    \'cancelImg\': \'/uploadify/cancel.png\',\n    \'queueID\': \'fileQueue\',\n    \'auto\': true,\n    \'multi\': false,\n    \'method\': \'post\',\n    onSelect: function(e, queueId, file) {\n        alert(file.name + "" selected"");\n    },\n    onComplete: function(e, queueId, file, response, data) {\n        alert(""complete: "" + response);\n    },\n    onCancel: function(e, queueId, file, data) {\n        alert(""cancel"");\n    }\n});\n', 'public void ProcessRequest(HttpContext context)\n{\n    Debug.WriteLine(""Save file"");\n\n    if (context.Request.Files.Count == 0)\n        throw new SystemException(""No files uploaded"");\n\n    // Get the file\n    HttpPostedFile file = context.Request.Files.Get(0);\n    Debug.WriteLine(""Got file: "" + file.FileName + "", Length: "" + file.ContentLength);\n\n    // Save it\n    string guid = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();\n    string path = Path.Combine(Path.GetTempPath(), guid + "".tmp"");\n    file.SaveAs(path);\n    Debug.WriteLine(""Saved to path: "" + path);\n\n    // Update response and return guid\n    context.Response.StatusCode = 200;\n    context.Response.Write(guid);\n\n    Debug.WriteLine(""All Done"");\n}\n']",False

I input the Name,Surname,ID and Address after each other in this order and then these are immediately saved into the file When the User inputs the ID card this calls this Search Method and checks through all the file to see whether the ID is unique or not. If it is not, then it returns 0 otherwise it returns 1 Now the problem is this. When I am inputting the ID, whether it is unique or not it keeps on going, but then when it outputs what I wrote it, for the NAME and SURNAME it shows only the first record I have stored there (like stuck in some kind of buffer), the ID and the address outputs normally. The File is Also NOT Updated meaning, the save file did not occur. Now when I Remove this method, the appending works normally, but I won't have access to the comparing of IDs.

100354,How to design a thread style messaging system on Google App Engine,"I'm trying to design a gmail like thread messaging system on Google App Engine by using Django-nonrel. I've watched ""Building Scalable, Complex Apps on App Engine"" and read the following questions on SO. App Engine Messaging System with Message Status - Design Pattern database design in google app engine I like the idea Kevin pointed at (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6349529/app-engine-messaging-system-with-message-status-design-pattern/6351131#6351131), so my current models are like these: ListField on Django-nonrel is from here: http://www.allbuttonspressed.com/blog/django/2010/03/Updates-on-djangoappengine And here is my problem, I don't know how to achieve to display a count of messages in each thread like gmail. Let me clarify my point. When a user, Sirius, sends a message to Harry and Ron. Models (simplified for explanation) should be like these: Then, Harry replies to Sirius, but for some reason he doesn't include Ron: And Sirius replies to Harry too, but he includes Ron again: And when Sirius and Harry see their inbox, there is the thread with a count of messages (3). And Ron sees his inbox there is the thread with a count of messages (2). How should I count those numbers? Should I make a new model to keep them? Thanks in advance, Yoo EDIT As Kevin introduced me to a Thread model and I realized that I don't need a relation index model for my requirements, so my current models look like the following. I might find difficulties in these models in further development, but I would go with them for the time being :)","['class Message(models.Model):\n    sender = models.ForeignKey(User)\n    content = models.TextField()\n    thread_id = models.IntegerField()\n\nclass MessageReceivers(models.Model):\n    message = models.ForeignKey(Message)\n    users = ListField(models.CharField())\n    status = models.IntegerField()  # 1 unread, 2 read ....\n', 'Message\nid = 1\nsender = Sirius\nthread_id = 1\n\nMessageReceivers\nmessage = 1\nusers = [Harry, Ron]\n', 'Message\nid = 2\nsender = Harry\nthread_id = 1\n\nMessageReceivers\nmessage = 2\nusers = [Sirius]\n', 'Message\nid = 3\nsender = Sirius\nthread_id = 1\n\nMessageReceivers\nmessage = 3\nusers = [Haary, Ron]\n', 'class Message(models.Model):\n    sender = models.ForeignKey(User)\n    content = models.TextField()\n\nclass Thread(models.Model):\n    user = models.ForeignKey(User)\n    messages = ListField(models.CharField())    # array of message id\n    lastmodified = models.DateTimeField()\n    # could have a status field for read or unread, not sure for now\n']",False

106133,iPhone application crash (iOS4 Only),My iPhone application occasionally crashs the first time it is run after being installed. After this every time i try and run the app it remains on the splash screen or even a black screen until eventually it dies. I have to restart the device to get the application to work. After this it works fine every time. The only change between the OS3 code and 4 is the property 'UIApplicationExitsOnSuspend' to force the app to reload every time instead of suspending. Any help would be great. Here are the two Code snippets: } Other Methods mentioned above: setAppDefaults - Enumerates through the settings bundle applying the defaultValues to NSUserDefaults if they have not been set already by the user in peferences. insertCheck - Performs some queries on the db to ensure file integrity on audio recordings but in this case as this is the first time the app is loaded it will do nothing. Update: I have commented out the extra method calls (the two above) and i am still having the problem.

Is there a different way to do it? (using MIPS architecture, or anything else) ---Edit Thanks Amadan. I understand that part, though. My problem is just that zero seems to be a special case. It does not seem to follow what normal numbers do: in my example above, there is no carry out of 1. I'm doing circuit design working with an ALU at the moment and trying to implement the overflow detection, when this one case came up that doesn't follow what the others do. We are assuming that with subtraction, the second operand is preinverted (twos complement) before going into the ALU (then added to the first operand). So, whenever the ""invert_b"" for subtraction is set to 1, b is inverted and we assume that the case we are checking for is subtraction, which should have a carry out of 1.",[],False

205028,Protect JBoss 7 Against Beast attack using SSL configuration,"The use of SSLv3.0/TLSv1.0 in combination with certain encryption techniques (CBC block ciphers) may allow for an attacker to predict the so-called Initialization Vector of subsequent SSL packets. Using this information the attacker can access the secure session of another user. This attack, named BEAST (Browser Exploit Against SSL/TLS), is aimed at the user’s browser and not at the web server. Nevertheless, it is possible to take countermeasures at the server side as well to prevent a successful attack. The complete solution to this problem is disabling or deprioritizing the support for vulnerable encryption ciphers (CBC block ciphers) when using SSLv3.0/TLSv1.0. Commonly, this can be achieved by prioritizing RC4 ciphers in the cipher negotiation process. For Apache web servers that support SSLv3.0/TLSv1.0 this can be configured by adding the following configuration: For Apache web servers that support SSLv3.1/TLSv1.1 and higher, it is recommended to use the following configuration: As far as I know, JBoss 7 is based on a version of Apache that supports SSLv3.1/TLSv1.1 (maybe I am wrong), so the second alternative can be applied to JBoss 7.

Normal HTTP servers respond with: SHOUTcast servers respond with: Again, the rest of the protocol is the same. The only difference is vs. . I would like to extend, subclass, or somehow modify Node's function so that I can make it work with SHOUTcast servers. Connecting to SHOUTcast with Node has been done before, but only by re-inventing the entire wheel. I'd rather not do that for what amounts to be a minor protocol difference. My Question: Is there a way to do one of the following? Extend or override the relevant parts of Node's HTTP parser. (I doubt this is possible, as it seems the parser is native code.) Create my own bit of code that parses the relevant parts of HTTP, but reuses as many existing Node components for HTTP as possible. Create a simple internal proxy (or somehow relay data) so that I can modify that first server response line prior to it reaching Node's HTTP parser. Something else? I have also considered using Shred, but it does not offer an option to stream the response. (It waits for the entire server response to be complete before firing an event, which won't work for streaming servers where the data can run indefinitely.) Along those same lines, I tried Request, but it uses Node's own HTTP parser, so I get the same parse errors as I would with the native HTTP client.","['http.request()', 'http.request()', 'HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n', 'ICY 200 OK\n', 'HTTP/1.x', 'ICY', 'http.request()']",False

476815,Access 2007 vba How to link a query to a button that will fill a field in a form?,"Since everyone has been so helpful to me as a Access/SQL/VBA newbie, I thought I'd try another question. I'm building a system tracking form for some of our information assurance processes and I've got a button on a form that I want to take a CSV formatted field called Affected_Machine_Name from Table B and insert it into the Affected_Machine_Name field in Table A, which is what the form is based off of. The query (All_Machine_Names) I wrote to try to do this looks like: INSERT INTO TableA ( Affected_Machine_Name.[Value] ) SELECT TableB.Affected_Machine_Name FROM TableA, TableB; After doing some research in one of the other posts, I have it linked into the button using the VBA onClick as follows: Public Sub All_Button() Screen.ActiveDatasheet!Affected_Machine_Name = DoCmd.OpenQuery ""All_Machine_Names"" End Sub My current problem is I get a syntax error for the sub function and I have no clue why because the error box provides no useful details. For that matter, I'm not even sure if my query is right, as I was trying to copy some of the other posts for how to do inserts. I think I'm not referencing the individual records as when I just run the query by itself, it wants to mod all 180 records instead of just the one I have highlighted. Any help that can be provided would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

483118,Lie algebra of a quotient of Lie groups,"Suppose I have a Lie group $G$ and a closed normal subgroup $H$, both connected. Then I can form the quotient $G/H$, which is again a Lie group. On the other hand, the derivative of the embedding $H\hookrightarrow G$ gives an embedding of Lie algebras, $\mathfrak{h}\hookrightarrow\mathfrak{g}$. Since $H$ is normal, $\mathfrak{h}$ is an ideal of $\mathfrak{g}$, so we can form the quotient algebra $\mathfrak{g}/\mathfrak{h}$. Is it then true that the Lie algebra of $G/H$ is canonically isomorphic to $\mathfrak{g}/\mathfrak{h}$? (I guess what I really want to know is: is the functor $\phi\mapsto d_e\phi$ exact?) If so, can we always write $\mathfrak{g}$ as a direct sum of vector spaces $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{h}\oplus\mathfrak{g}&#39;$ where $\mathfrak{g}&#39;$ is a subalgebra of $\mathfrak{g}$ isomorphic to $\mathfrak{g}/\mathfrak{h}$?

Everything looks fine, but there is one issue. One of the methods i've ported from my framework through module, takes a UIView and adds to it another uiview as a subview. This subview contains a UIView with a UIButton. Problem is that sometimes subview appeares on the screen but without label on the button, i have to click the button, then the label appeares. But in some situations (it depends when i call this method from the module in javascript), subview doesn't appeare at all, but it is actually there because when i tap on the place where it should be, button's click event handler is being called.

As long as my application logic requires me to have many other tree types like CherryTree, ApricotTree and etc., it means that interface TreeBehaviour would not be sufficient solution, because by setting 'areTheyAllGrown' specifically of AppleTree, I want to mark let's say: only my AppleTree instances for that, not all Tree instances. See? You would say: make an AppleTreeImpl interface and put the property in there... well.. that would force hell of an interfaces, to create only for one property...Impl Interface for all my different tree types? Isn't there a more short solution? Ofcourse I see many other ways to implement the whole stuff, and to work around the need of dynamic referencing to a class, however, I am interested If I can do it particulary by this method.

518536,Using Ajax Loading with Smart Search field,"Imagine the Google search bar. When you type something it is Smart Searchable where it gives you possible results while typing. My search bar does that.

Can someone share direction on what I'm missing in getting an Ajax Loading gif to be visible while waiting for options and then once chosen showing the Loading gif while waiting to show your result? Using ASP and jQuery Here is what I got so far: This is what it should be before anything is typed in the search box, a magnifying glass: Then while typing it is set up to show results of what you might be looking for. And while those results are loading I would like to have a loading icon spin. It would then stop and go back to the Magnifying glass and then once you click Enter or select an option and click enter or maybe even just type a search result and click Enter the loading icon would then spin again indicating you to wait while the result is generating.

UPDATED CODE: my new problem is that it just blows through the com ports, i need it to stop for each one, take a second to listen, then close it. it just blows through the foreach loop. now, the reason why i don't just open up the port and keep it open through all the messages is that my devices have different baud rates, and i can't adjust them to all match. so, i need to open the ports, then send messages, listen, if they don't respond to the first round of messages, then open them up at the new baudrate and send a new batch of messages. but the foreachloop doens't pause for me to listen.","['foreach (string s in SerialPort.GetPortNames())\n{\n     var serialOneOfMany = new SerialPort(s, baudRate, Parity.None, 8, StopBits.One);\n     if (serialOneOfMany.IsOpen)\n            {\n                serialOneOfMany.Close();\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                try\n                {\n                    serialOneOfMany.Open();\n                }\n                catch\n                {\n\n                    var openSerial = new System.Timers.Timer(3100);\n                    openSerial.Elapsed += (o, e) =&gt;\n                    {\n                        serialOneOfMany.Open();\n                        openSerial.Enabled = false;\n\n                        openSerial.Dispose();\n                    };\n                    openSerial.Enabled = true;\n\n                }                   \n            }\n\n            if (serialOneOfMany.IsOpen)\n            {\n                string received;\n\n                try\n                {\n                    lblPortNum.Content = s;\n                    lblPortNum.Refresh();\n\n\n                        serialOneOfMany.Write(testMessage);\n\n                    serialOneOfMany.DataReceived += new SerialDataReceivedEventHandler(testSerialPort_DataReceived);\n\n                }\n                catch (TimeoutException e)\n                {\n                    serialOneOfMany.Close();\n                    continue;\n                }\n\n            }\n        } \n', 'DispatcherTimer time = new DispatcherTimer();\ntime.Interval = TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(3000);\ntime.Tick += new EventHandler(someEventHandler);\ntime.Start();\n', ' private void someEventHandler(Object sender, EventArgs args)\n    {\n        SerialPort serial = (SerialPort)sender;\n         if (serial.IsOpen)\n            serial.Close();\n        serial.Dispose();\n\n        //if you want this event handler executed for just once\n         DispatcherTimer thisTimer = (DispatcherTimer)sender;\n         thisTimer.Stop();\n    }\n', 'private void button1_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n{\n    CheckPorts();\n}\n\nprivate void checkPorts()\n{\n    SendMessage(""messageToDevice1"", 19200);\n    SendMessage(""Message2"", 9600);\n}\n\n\n\nprivate void SendMessage(string testMessage, int baudRate)\n{\n    int baudRate = 9600;\n    string testMessage = ""test"";\n    txtPortName.Text = ""Testing all serial ports"";\n    foreach (string s in SerialPort.GetPortNames())\n    {\n        SerialPort newPort = new SerialPort(s, baudRate, Parity.None, 8, StopBits.One);\n        if (!newPort.IsOpen)\n        {\n            try\n            {\n                newPort.Open();\n            }\n            catch { }\n        }\n        if (newPort.IsOpen)\n        {\n            openPorts.Add(newPort);\n            newPort.Write(testMessage);\n            newPort.DataReceived += new SerialDataReceivedEventHandler(serialOneOfMany_DataReceived);\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            newPort.Dispose();\n        }\n    }\n    txtPortName.Text = ""Waiting for response"";\n    tmrPortTest.Enabled = true;\n}\n']",False

896166,Problem updating MySQL database.... Help?,"Ok so I have a Mysql dsetup called and I have written a vb.net client program to get information from the table in the database, display it in a data grid view, and then allow to user to edit this information and update it on the server. Right now I am hosting the server on my Gateway laptop and also connecting to it from the same laptop therefore I'm using as the server name. My problem is that when I go into the program and change the information and click update, nothing happens... the information stays the same yet there is no sign of an error, syntax failure, or program crash. I've tried running this on another computer in my house and i get the same results. I can access the information without a hitch but updating it is where I run into trouble. If there was a problem with my code it would have displayed some sort of error or asked me to debug my script, which would have made it a lot easier to solve, therefore i am certain that it has something to do with my database. Before I got to this step, i kept getting an error when retrieving the information that said something like DUPLICATE DEFAULT ENTRY FOR PRIMARY KEY = '0' which means that the columns in the table related to this error cannot have more than one default value of '0', but that's gone now... (even though i didn't change anything) Here is the script that will recreate my database layout. just run it in MySql WorkBench or MySql Query Browser (or what ever your using to manage your Sql Database).

I have 2 drives installed: C Drive: Windows XP: Media Center Edition G Drive: 2 partitions: Windows 7 (beta) Windows XP (professional) That is also the order they are connected. The C Drive is my primary drive. When I attempt to boot the computer, the bios loading screen appears normally; the progress bar moves and it's fine. The very next page, however, supposed to be a boot choice. When I installed Windows 7 onto the G Drive in context of the C drive it added a boot selector to the C drive's boot sequence. It gives me the option of booting Windows 7 or Windows XP: Media Center Edition. However, my problem is now this: After the bios screen I previously mentioned, instead of a boot selector, I receive the following error: A disk read error occurred. Press CTRL+ALT+DEL to restart. The drive is spinning up normally. I hear no odd noises/clicks/scraping coming from it, even after disabling the other drive to listen to it carefully. According to me, it's a boot sector issue. I have never experienced this before, but maybe during a recent shutdown, Windows XP: MCE errored out and ruined the boot sector. Dilemma! I don't have the Windows XP: MCE disc, because it was installed by the factory. I have accessed the hidden partition on the drive before (you hit a key combination on the bios screen and it comes up with an interface to fix your drive). However, I don't want to reformat the drive (which is what the interface gives me the option to do). I want to possibly fix the boot sector. How can I achieve that?",[],False

959465,How does integrating the Kolmogorov forward equation give $P = \exp (Qt)$?,"I originally asked this question on the stats site and I recieved an answer and after looking through the answer, I had some pure maths bits I didn't understand. The main ones were integrating matrices, which is what this question is about. If $Q$ is a generator matrix of a continuous time Markov chain (CTMC), and I need to use this matrix to solve the Kolmogorov forward equation, I would need to start by integrating it. But I haven't got a clue how to do it. Can someone show me please? I know something like, let's assume $i$ represents the current state of a CTMC. Then, the forward equation basically tells us that we can work out $X(i + 1)$ by doing $$X(i + 1) = X(i) \cdot (Id_2 + Q)$$ To look at the difference in time, we can subtract $X(i)$ from both sides and get $$X(i + 1) - X(i) = X(i) Q$$ Thinking of this in terms of functions instead of matrices, we can say that this can be written as $$ P'(t) = X(i) Q dt$$ But I don't get how you get to this bit and how you can integrate from here. I would really appreciate any help. Thank you.",[],False

1113612,Scrolling of oversized view? (iPhone),"I imagine this is pretty dead-simple, but somehow I haven’t been able to get it to work: I need to display a View containing a group of controls (roughly 800px tall) -- which can be scrolled vertically by the user, as that view is too big to fit on the screen all at once. That’s it. I’d think that this might mean something like this: UIView [the oversized one] ... and then enabling vertical scrolling, etc. But somehow I'm missing something, as the best I've gotten is the first screenful to appear on-screen, without the ability to scroll down. ~~~ [Note: I know that this might often be done using a Table view, and vertical scrolling then happens for ‘free’. But this is a series of special-purpose controls (an odd assortment of various UISliders, UISwitches, UILabels, UIButtons, etc.) that wouldn’t readily fit into a standard table view without a bunch of customizing anyway. They’re also static as well (i.e., don’t need to be changed programatically) -- hence they can be completely built in IB, and that’s how I’d much prefer to do it for this situation anyway. I just need to allow the whole lot to be accessible via scrolling. I also know that they could be split up into multiple screens, and I'll do this if absolutely necessary; but they're a unified logical group, and so that's not the optimal choice in this instance.] Any suggestions? That (and/or a code fragment) would be VERY much appreciated. Many thanks in advance!",[],False

I use both several SqlDataSources and custom made controls utilising 6 in total on one page. I can eliminate the problem if I deactivate the controls with the / pattern.

We are using the Casper Suite and Helpdesk Pilot 3, and I've noted a couple of similar questions below, but none of these seem to do what I want regarding tracking the history of an asset (although it could well be that I'm using the tools wrong). What I'd Like To Track: I want a history that shows when the computer was put into service, taken out of service for repair, moved to another location, and put into service again (and what its name was, and what Lab or User it was associated with.) I want to be able to add notes (such as the condition of the hardware, troubleshooting done, repairs done, services changed, etc). When a unit fails and needs to go in for repair, an identical unit is put into its place. I really want a nice way to track this. I especially want to be able to look at a User's or Lab's history, to tell if certain entities aren't taking good care of their computers. [We usually know, but can't back it up.] I don't necessarily need to track MAC addresses, Serial numbers, software versions, etc. Casper tracks that well (and if I could figure out which unit in one system corresponds to a unit in the other system, all the details can be pieced together.) As lots of little notes would be needed, it needs to be fast and easy to use, or nothing will get documented! A wiki could almost work, but it'd be nice to have timestamps in the asset history [and heck, to be able to do SQL queries on the data]. Something that does Asset History well (and maybe nothing else) would be great. An integrated system may make sense, but I'm loath to replace our helpdesk now that users are finally used to the idea.

The other option I have is to split the Contains into 6 separate columns, since there's never going to be more than 6 items in a Group, but then I'm not sure how to search all 6 columns without relying on six OR queries: I'm not sure what the most efficient way of handling this is. I could use some advice from those with more experience with normalizing this kind of data please.

1320954,Bit counting arbitrarily large positive integers in C#,"There are many implementations of bit counting out there but in my case, I need to test if an arbitrarily large number contains at most two set bits.

IMPORTANT: The argument [number] sent to the function will NEVER be negative. Some points I thought of were: Making the function static. Done. Using a static lookup array. Done. Using pointers instead of array indexes since the number of bytes often crosses 100,000. Not sure how much this would help. Forcing an inline function which sadly cannot be guaranteed in .NET.

While my actual installer is much more complicated, I have been able to reproduce this with a very basic installer that has a single feature containing a single component. That component contains a dll, a manifest and a security catalogue. The dlls &lt;File&gt; element has KeyPath, Assembly and AssemblyManifest attributes set. Once installed, I can simulate a process loading the assembly by opening the DLL in MSVS. Is there an extra action I should be invoking on uninstall to detect and prevent this situation? Alternatively, is there a way of forcing the install operation to be performed even though the DLLs already exist in WinSXS? Somewhat related, I also have a problem if I try to upgrade the package that installed the assembly if the assembly is not changing. The installer decides that it does not need to reinstall the assembly (since it has not changed), but then when the SxsUninstallCA runs, it goes and removes the assembly. From Installer's point of view, the component is still installed, but the files are gone.",[],False

1461215,How likely is it for a randomly picked number to be larger than all previously chosen numbers?,"Suppose we pick a uniformly distributed number on the range [a,b]. Then we continue to pick more numbers on the same range. Let n(t) be the number of times we have found a number bigger than any previously found, after sampling t total numbers. The initial number picked is not counted. Solve: $$\lim_{t\to\infty}\sqrt[n(t)]{t}$$ For reference, the problem I'm trying to solve is the geometric mean of the amount of time it takes to find the next bigger number, relative to the amount of time it took for the previous bigger number. So say it finds a new best value at the 4th try, 11th try, and 29th try, I get: $$\sqrt[3]{4*\dfrac{11}{4}*\dfrac{29}{11}}$$ which simplifies into the top equation. Experiments seem to indicate the amount of time it takes to find the next number multiples by about 3 for each number found, but I'm curious if there might be tools to solve this analytically. Interestingly, the value seems to be the same even if I take the randomly chosen number and plug it into a function (i.e. I'm checking to see if f(x) is greater than any previously seen f(x) for random values of x). Related questions: Is there any way to guess at the probability of finding a new biggest number? Can the geometric mean be shown to be a constant across all (or some) functions? Intuitively I feel like it should be. I don't have too extensive a background in math, so I'm hoping this isn't an unsolved problem.",[],False

1499538,Sharing session data between contexts in Tomcat,"I have been looking at solutions for sharing session data between mutliple war files. I came across the following solution http://www.fwd.at/tomcat/sharing-session-data-howto.html The basic idea of it is that if you have more than one war file, you can set a cookie using the sessionid of the first context that is used. The cookie can be set using a path that will apply to all contexts/applications. For example, if i have the following configuration for 3 applicatons I can set a cookie as follows /myapp sessionid. The sessionid cookie will then be sent to any request with /myapp in the address. This allows the session id to then be used by any of the contexts. The only problem with this approach is that it was written in 2003 and tested on Tomcat 4. What are your opinions of this approach? Is there a better way of doing it?

I want to ensure that the interceptor is not applied to every object in the chain of decorators. Instead it should only be applied to the outermost decorator. In this case, it should be getting applied to and not . I've got a lot of classes in the actual solution, so if possible I'd like to use an interceptor selector to do it in order to avoid a lot of repetitive code for manually applying interceptors. And that's where I get stuck. Obviously I don't want to hard-code it into the , since the specific object which needs to have the interceptor supplied might be different whenever the selection of decorators or the order in which they're applied changes. At that point I'm sure it would be a lot easier to stick with manual registration. And I can't figure out any sort of convention that will do the job. So, can it be done?

1527256,Did the Irish Catholic church have slaves in Ireland as recently as 1996?,"This article covers the topic well, but is more about the Irish government admitting collusion with the supposed slave holders. Labelled the ""Maggies"", the women and girls were stripped of their names and dumped in Irish Catholic church-run laundries where nuns treated them as slaves, simply because they were unmarried mothers, orphans or regarded as somehow morally wayward. Over 74 years, 10,000 women were put to work in de facto detention, mostly in laundries run by nuns. Were people really held as slaves? What was their treatment like? Clarification: What is a slave? Obviously, they were not actually considered property by anyone and it must have been underground because slavery is illegal in Ireland. But were these people basically slaves in that they were prevented from leaving at their own will and were they forced to do labor or suffer consequences (beating, no food, etc.) I am asking the question because when google searching I see people saying things like ""In 1996, Bill Clinton was president, Yahoo’s search-engine was two years old, and the Roman Catholic Church had slaves.""

I have 2 communicating devices communicating through my proxy device. I want to know how I can periodically check for the status of the connection. The proxy programs are in java.

I'm self-taught using some books and my knowledge of math logic and I've only been programming for three weeks so I'm still learning the ins and outs of it all. Here's some background: I've got a player image surrounded by a bounding rectangle and the code will check to see when that player rectangle intersects a rectangle that is the finish line. Each time it successfully intersects the line, p1Laps gets incremented. When the value reaches a certain point, the game is over and the player is declared the winner. Here's the problem and the questions: My problem is that Java is counting multiple intersects each time the rectangles cross. Usually 8 intersects so p1Laps gets incremented 8 times. This would not be a problem if it happened consistently, but sometimes the laps increment at different values. I've encountered increments of 4,7, and 8 so it's hard to set a value to ensure that the race will end after a certain number of laps. My first question is ""why?"" Why is java counting so many intersects when the two rectangles cross? I'm assuming it has something to do with them both being 2D shapes, but I could be wrong. My second question is how to make the increments happen at a consistent value? Preferably ""1"" but that is not paramount as I can just adjust the finishing value. Here is the code that seems relevant (a lot of code is removed): As stated, the increments usually go up by 8, but I've had them go by 7 for (seemingly) no reason and they go up by only 4 if ""Boost"" is enabled (doubles the speed of player).

1720145,When is the right time to branch and when is the wrong time?,"Is there a specific rule I should be using for when to branch in source control? Branches seem to be expensive because they require that the team have extra knowledge about where the features they want to work on should go. Our development team sometimes finds itself working on a long term feature and a shorter term feature at the same time. That means we end up with: Trunk -Branch A (Short Term) -Branch B (Long Term) After they complete we have to merge A in to the trunk, then merge the changes to the trunk back in to B to make sure those edits still function. It's messy. I am wondering if we can cut down on branches by using Labels (Or tags, or pins or whatever your Source Control Software of choice calls it). Maybe it makes sense to branch for the longer term project, but we could just do the edits for the short term project right in the trunk after applying a label to the stable release. That way we can always retrieve the source code that was stable if we have to do an emergency bug fix, but we don't have to deal with the branch.

1744276,updating nested attributes fails because uniqueness validation fails,"Here are the associations and the relevant dependencies and validation :post_tags true the problem is this: when I want to assign a tag to a post (i.e. post.tags &lt;&lt; new_tag), the operation fails if a tag with the same content already exists in the database, because of the uniqueness validations failing. the desired behavior would be this: when assigning a new tag to a post - if the tag already exists then do not try to create a new tag, rather only create the post_tag relation. This will avoid the uniqueness validation failure, but still assign the tag to the post if the tag does not exists, then create a new tag and also a post_tag relation. What would be a clean way to do this? Thanks, -p.s. Two methods I'm pondering are doing the association creations by hand, ie not using the nested attributes feature.

1766778,Roundtrip XML Serialization of DateTime and xsd:date?,"OK, what am I missing here? MSDN says the following with regard to DateTimeSerializationMode: In versions 2.0 and later of the .Net Framework, with this property set to RoundtripDateTime objects are examined to determine whether they are in the local, UTC or an unspecified time zone, and are serialized in such a way that this information is preserved. This is the default behavior and is recommended for all new applications that do not communicate with older versions of the framework. However: So for XSD elements defined as ""date"" rather than ""dateTime"", the date is not serialized as UTC. This is a problem, because if I deserialize this XML the resulting date will be of Kind Unspecified, and any conversion to UTC (which should in fact be a no-op because the UTC-ness of the date should have been preserved during the roundtrip), will change at least the time of day, with a 50% chance of making the date yesterday, depending on whether you're east or west of Greenwich. Shouldn't the date get written as: ? Indeed, if I deserialize a document that contains the above, I get a DateTime that's already been converted to Local time (I'm in New York so that's Aug 17th 20:00), and if I immediately serialize that object back to XML, I get: So, UTC was converted to Local on the way in, and the time part of that Local dropped on the way out, which will make it Unspecified on the way back in again. We've lost all knowledge of the original UTC date specification of August 18th. Here's what the W3C says about xsd:date: [Definition:] The ·value space· of date consists of top-open intervals of exactly one day in length on the timelines of dateTime, beginning on the beginning moment of each day (in each timezone), i.e. '00:00:00', up to but not including '24:00:00' (which is identical with '00:00:00' of the next day). For nontimezoned values, the top-open intervals disjointly cover the nontimezoned timeline, one per day. For timezoned values, the intervals begin at every minute and therefore overlap. The fundamental problem is that if I do the following: Construct (or otherwise receive) a UTC DateTime value. Serialize to XML with a schema defining that field as xsd:date Deserialize that XML back to a DateTime. Convert the DateTime to UTC (which should have no effect since the ""roundtrip"" should have preserved this). Or the following: Deserialize an XML document containing a UTC xsd:date object (eg. 2009-08-18Z). Serialize it back to a new XML document without touching it. Either of these procedures should get me the same date I put in. Workaround The only way I can see so far to get the roundtrip behaviour I expect is to implement the Date property as follows, on the assumption that all xsd:date elements represent UTC:","['namespace ConsoleApplication1 {\n    public class DateSerTest {\n        [XmlElement(DataType = ""date"")]\n        public DateTime Date { get; set; }\n    }\n\n    class Program {\n        static void Main(string[] args) {\n            DateSerTest d = new DateSerTest { \n                Date = DateTime.SpecifyKind(new DateTime(2009,8,18), DateTimeKind.Utc),\n            };\n            XmlSerializer ser = new XmlSerializer(typeof(DateSerTest));\n            using (FileStream fs = new FileStream(""out.xml"", FileMode.Create)) {\n                ser.Serialize(fs, d);\n            }\n\n            // out.xml will contain:\n            // &lt;Date&gt;2009-08-18&lt;/Date&gt;\n\n            using (FileStream fs = new FileStream(""out.xml"", FileMode.Open)) {\n                DateSerTest d1 = (DateSerTest) ser.Deserialize(fs);\n                Console.WriteLine(d1.Date); // yields: 8/18/2009 12:00:00 AM\n                Console.WriteLine(d1.Date.Kind); // yields: Unspecified\n            }\n\n            // in.xml:\n            // &lt;DateSerTest&gt;\n            //     &lt;Date&gt;2009-08-18Z&lt;/Date&gt;\n            // &lt;/DateSerTest&gt;\n\n            using (FileStream fs = new FileStream(""in.xml"", FileMode.Open)) {\n                DateSerTest d1 = (DateSerTest) ser.Deserialize(fs);\n                Console.WriteLine(d1.Date); // yields: 8/17/2009 8:00:00 PM\n                Console.WriteLine(d1.Date.Kind); // yields: Local\n                using (FileStream fs1 = new FileStream(""out2.xml"", FileMode.Create)) {\n                    ser.Serialize(fs1, d1);\n\n                    // out2.xml will contain:\n                    // &lt;Date&gt;2009-08-17&lt;/Date&gt;\n                }\n            }\n            Console.ReadKey();\n        }\n    }\n}\n', '  &lt;Date&gt;2009-08-18Z&lt;/Date&gt;\n', '  &lt;Date&gt;2009-08-17&lt;/Date&gt;\n', '[XmlElement(DataType = ""date"")]\npublic DateTime Date {\n    get { return _dt; }\n    set { _dt = value.Kind == DateTimeKind.Unspecified ? \n                    DateTime.SpecifyKind(value, DateTimeKind.Utc) : \n                    value.ToUniversalTime(); }\n}\n']",False

1793788,DMZ Setup with two firewalls - Traffic from DMZ to LAN and LAN to DMZ,"I am setting up a network with machines that need to be accessible from the internet. I'm planning on putting these in a DMZ. Some of the machines in the DMZ need access to machines on the private network and machines on the private network need access to machines in the DMZ. I have read that the most secure implementation is one with two firewalls. The two firewalls that I am planning on using are both CISCO ASA 5500. Although I am interested in how I can implement this with those specific devices, I am also interested in the theoretical side because I am creating documentation for customers of our company on how to set this up. Instructions specific to the devices I'm using help, but I also want to know how to solve this generically. I have three specific machines: DMZ_Web DMZ_Service INT_SRV As their names describe, DMZ_Web and DMZ_Service are in the DMZ and INT_SRV is the internal server. I also have two firewalls: FW1 FW2 In short: Ext Clients need access to DMZ_Web on port 443 Ext Clients need access to DMZ_Service on port 3030 DMZ_Web needs access to INT_SRV on port 2020 In Clients need access to DMZ_Service on port 3030 Networking: FW1 is connected to the internet, the DMZ, and the internal network FW2 is connected to the DMZ network (outside interface), and the internal network (inside interface) Internal Network is 192.168.1.0 255.255.0.0 DMZ Network is 192.169.1.0 255.255.0.0 DMZ machines have two NICs, one connected to FW1 and one connected to FW2. The NICs connected to FW2 have static IPs in the 192.169.1.0 range. The NICs connected to FW1 have static IPs that are publicly accessible from the internet. Linked below is a diagram that I hope will answer a lot of questions concerning topology. I've gathered that I may need to setup some static NAT rules to get traffic from the DMZ machines to the internal network and vice versa, but I'm not sure. One thing I would like to point out is that the internal network is connected to FW1 &amp; FW2. It is connected to FW1 to allow access to internet.

1862709,"Thermal advantage of ""server"" CPUs over ""consumer"" CPUs","It seems that one of the main advantage of CPUs that are marketed for servers (e.g. the AMD Opteron and Intel Xeon) over CPUs marketed for consumers (e.g. AMD Phenom II and Intel i7) is related to reliability under thermal strain. The response given on superuser.com to the question ""Advantages of server-versions (Xeon, Opteron) of CPU's"" totes a common line in my searches on Google for an answer. The claims typically involve three categories of advantage (which are quite regularly repeated): 1. Heat resistance ""Server"" CPUs are better able to withstand more heat for longer than their ""consumer"" counterparts. Presumably the advantage would be that the ""server"" CPU would last significantly longer before dying if the fan cut out, or alternatively requires less cooling. 2. Performance and optimization ""Server"" CPUs have faster speeds or are optimized for server tasks, for example from the link from techpowerup.com stating the advantages of a ""server"" version: Tweaked memory controllers, Cache sizes, thermal outputs, voltages, testing scemes, HT links, pricing, included heatsink, speed binning, many things. First of all opty's are tweaked for higher throughput vs latency. Also their cache sizes in reguard to their speed is also larger. Voltages and TDP are lower compared to their equivelint x2 or phenom units. 3. Features ""Server"" CPUs have certain features the ""consumer"" CPUs do not have, e.g. ""HyperThreading and Virtualization Technologies"" (from the Superuser link), or support for error correcting code (ECC) memory. Of the above advantages commonly toted as the basis for CPU manufacturers selling their ""server"" versions at significantly higher prices than the ""consumer"" versions, I'm particularly skeptical of the claim of thermal resilience. So let's ignore claims #2 (performance) and #3 (features). I'm skeptical of greater reliability in general, but I think it's fair to say that a significant portion of CPU failure is, in regular consumer and server usage, related to thermal resistance (i.e. heat increases the rate of failure). Rather than differentiation between reliability based on ""server"" or ""consumer"" branding, I'd expect that all CPUs of a similar die size would have similar thermal resistance qualities. In other words, I think die size plays a much larger role than branding. Are server CPUs more resilient to the effects of heat than consumer CPUs of the same die size? EDIT: Edited the above to limit the claims to thermal strain (i.e. removed ""features"" and ""speed""), as per the comments of Fabian and others.",[],False

1887221,Elegant operator overloading in D,"For a while I was confused about the direction of D's operator overloading, but now I realize it's a beautiful system... if It would only work with core types (int, float, etc). Consider the follow code: struct Vector { float X, Y; void opOpAssign(string op)(Vector vector) { X.opOpAssign!op(vector.X); // ERROR: no property ""opOpAssign"" for float Y.opOpAssign!op(vector.Y); // ERROR: ditto } } This would be beautiful code if it worked, seeing as it overloads all +=, -=, *=, etc.. operators in one method. However, as you can see, it doesn't work out of the box. I have created a solution using templates (god I love D): template Op(string op, T) { void Assign(ref T a, T b) { static if (op == ""+"") a += b; else if (op == ""-"") a -= b; else if (op == ""*"") a *= b; else if (op == ""/"") a /= b; } } struct Vector { float X, Y; void opOpAssign(string op)(Vector vector) { Op!(op, typeof(X)).Assign(X, vector.X); Op!(op, typeof(Y)).Assign(Y, vector.Y); } } This is fine, only I'd much prefer to keep everything ""in house"". Is there a way to make this work without the aid of a template? I know I'm being picky here, seeing as there's no performance loss and it's not hard to import a module in situation I need to do this.

1887534,Internet Explorer quirk - Frameset rows & cols properties when dragging/resizing frames,"Salut all, I'll try and keep this brief: In one of the visually gnarlier areas of the web app I'm responsible for I've written a couple of simple JS functions to store and recall the positions of frames within a frameset. The screen is highly user specific and consists of nested framesets (I know, I know but this is legacy code and we presently don't have the resource available to refactor it) and it's nice for them to drag frames around so they can see the elements they need, these positions are written to a cookie so that when they next enter this area of functionality it's presented much as they left it. This works beautifully in Firefox which I mostly use to develop with but has failed testing under IE8 which we need to support. I think I've identified the properties that are responsible: These arrays are written to a cookie but it's the position values obtained that seem to be at fault. It doesn't matter which variant I use e.g. the rows and cols properties are never updated in IE after the frames have been dragged to their new position. Every other aspect is working as intended - the cookies are created as the frameset unloads and on loading the frame properties are written to. Ironically IE has no problem writing to these properties if I supply hard-coded values, the frames will then resize like a charm but it seems I'm unable to record their values after the frames have been manually repositioned. Futhermore, I can see the properties changing under Firefox's Firebug when I manually drag the frames around to resize them but not with IE's developer tools - the frames' rows and cols properties remain as ther initial/default values, even after refreshing the output. Values of rows and cols after dragging frames: I would love to get this working, has anyone encountered anything similar or perhaps there is another approach or way of accessing these properties I could use to store the frame positions? This should be fairly standard stuff - I'm struggling to believe that IE doesn't update the frame properties after they have been repositioned. Edit: I think this is a feature of nested framesets in IE - a test of simple frames inside a single frameset looks as if the rows and cols properties will update when the divider is moved, not so with nested framesets. Any help hugely appreciated. Thanks!

Proof of concept work has started for an externally available ASP.Net web API and we were thinking of trying to use an implementation of IQueryable to be able to use OData. The problem is that the web API would be another ""front-end"" that accesses a service layer that is a network hop away, which means we have to write our own implementation of IQueryable. One IQueryable implementation is what I call a RangeQueryable which would be abstract and take three generic parameters; TRaw, TData, TRange. It would be an In the previous code line RawData is TRaw, ConvertedData is TData and DateTime is TRange. RangeQueryable would also have two abstract methods. GetData would make a call to the service layer over the network and use and as parameters in the call. Convert would then convert the data into my types.

2036549,Is there a useful definition of minors for digraphs?,"For an undirected graph, my ""intuitive"" understanding of a minor is that I take a subgraph, partition it's vertex set into connected subsets and contract each subset into a single vertex. If I try the same definition with a directed graph (=digraph), I have the problem that there is a distinction between weakly connected and strongly connected. Even so I saw a definition where connected was simply replaced by weakly connected during my research for this question, such a definition doesn't seem to be very useful, or at least doesn't coincide with my ""intuition"" about what a minor for a digraph should be. What I don't like about that definition is that there might exist more directed paths after the contraction of the subsets into single vertices than there were before. Has anybody seen a definition of minors for digraphs that better matches my ""intuition""? Any references to a book or paper (even if not available online)? Of course, I don't mind if the concept isn't called ""minor"", I just care for the concept itself.",[],False

2065894,Normal vector to a surface,"I've been reading in my calc book that the gradient vector is always orthogonal to the surface. So for a surface in space described by the level surface $f(x,y,z) = k$ where $k$ is a constant, $\nabla f$ is orthogonal to the surface at every point because the gradient is the normal vector of the surface at every point. Then later I read about parametric surfaces where a surface is described by vector valued function $r(u,v) = &lt;x(u,v), y(u,v), z(u,v)&gt;$ and a normal vector $r_u \times r_v$ or $r_v \times r_u$ How are $r_u \times r_v$ and $\nabla f$ related here? I am referring to James Stewart's Text. Also a last comment I want to make is, what about a normal vector to a surface that doesn't need to be described by a level surface? For example $f(x,y) = z = x^2 + y^2$? How would I go finding the normal vector at any point without rewriting it as $z - x^2 - y^2 = 0$ or parametrizing it? A final Remark: I've been confusing the notion of the gradient vector being tangent to a surface instead of normal to it. There is this rather confusing picture I have which seems to suggests that the gradient vector really is tangent to a surface rather than normal because the gradient is formed by the vector sum of $\partial/\partial x$ and $\partial/\partial y$ and according to the picture I have, both $\partial/\partial x$ and $\partial/\partial x$ are ""flat"" and their sum should also be ""flat"" and not ""pointing up"" Added PIcture",[],False

Also, going forward, I want the ability for each of the USB device classes to have their own properties - such as for a USB to serial converter, or for a HID device (to allow CreateFile, ReadFile and WriteFile access), etc. All of which are to be populated from values read from the individual devices registry branch (again using the SetupDixxx function calls). I had considered extending the interface to include an method which would get called by the DeviceManager, but this would need access to a number of unmanaged structs in the hardware class which seems undesirable. Another option would be to decorate the custom properties of the USB device, indicating which are to be populated by . Now, I guess my question would be - is this or would this be a good implementation of what I'm wanting to achieve? Are there any blatantly obvious improvements that I'm missing? All the code works, so from a suitability point of view it is absolutely fine but is there a better and cleaner implementation - would a Factory (or any other) pattern help me in this instance?

However, when I tried using the enterFrame event to do the main loop, there were a few problems. First of all, physics simulation seemed way too fast. Is the enterFrame event called more than once per frame? I set the application's global frame rate to 24, so shouldn't the application set off the event every 1/24 of a second? And the second problem is that when the game runs like this, some MXML components that are added are not shown. I have absolutely no idea why this happens. Help me please?!? Thanks.",[],False

That is, a character from the first string can be represented by nothing, itself or a character from a small set of characters. There's no simple rule for this character-to-character mapping, although there are some patterns. Given several thousands of such string pairs, how do I deduce the transformation rules such that if I apply them to the left strings, I get the right strings?

I have over 100 classes that call some same stuff (e.g Class ) and i am thinking that this behaviour can be abstracted and set to a base class, and everybody will inherit from this base class so as to remove copy/paste code. However, i want to avoid copy/paste code in the spring configuration file by defining an object and then define a child object foreach and every class that inherits from . I am looking for a way to set the abstract class's properties and then all child elements to automatically get them via configuration. I want to avoid to make the abstract class like this: thanks for any suggestions EDIT: to make things a bit more complicated the child classes are ASP.NET pages, so i have limited control as to how they are generated. Currently i'm employing the above mentioned code where the abstract class makes a reference to a DI created object with Id ""Injectable"". I would like to avoid flying strings UPDATE (With solution) Consider: Classes spring cfg ... and the effect will be for each inheritor of will have the property injected with what i configured. it matters little if this can be achieved with some kind of convention binding but i do not want use strings and using DI references from inside my code. 2nd UPDATE AND SOLUTION thanks to tobsen and Erich Eichinger the solution was found: Firstly, this is not supported natively, but the solution is not very ugly nor breaks DI pattern norms in a bad way Now, all the spring configuration required is given above (in the update) Erich's solution is this, make an like so: and that's it! (don't forget to register the module in web.config as always) In search of functionality (and perhaps elegance) i found that instead of using the (i did't want to add yet another class) you can declare the as such and it works like a charm without requiring any added modules etc. Gladly this works on UserControls as well (albeit in a different event in the lifecycle since OnPreInit does not exist for usercontrols): thanks for watching!","['public abstract class Foo\n{\n    public Injectable Prop {get;set;}\n}\n', 'Injectable', 'Injectable', 'Foo', 'public abstract class Foo\n{\n    public Injectable Prop \n    { \n       get { return (Injectable)ContextRegistry.GetContext()[""Injectable""]; }\n    }\n}\n', 'public abstract class BasePage : System.Web.UI.Page\n{\n   public IInjectable FooProp {get;set;}\n}\n\npublic abstract class BaseControl : System.Web.UI.UserControl\n{\n   public IInjectable FooProp {get;set;}\n}\n\npublic partial class ChildPage : BasePage\n{\n   protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)\n   {\n       FooProp.DoSomeThing();\n   }\n}\n\npublic partial class ChildControl : BaseControl\n{\n   protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)\n   {\n       FooProp.DoSomeThing();\n   }\n}\n', '&lt;object id=""Injectable"" type=""ConcreteInjectable""&gt;\n    &lt;property name=""SomeProp"" value=""Injected!!"" /&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n&lt;!--The requirement is to declare something like:--&gt;\n&lt;object type=""BasePage"" abstract=""true""&gt;\n  &lt;property name=""FooProp"" ref=""Injectable /&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n&lt;!--it works for usercontrols too--&gt;\n&lt;object type=""BaseControl"" abstract=""true""&gt;\n  &lt;property name=""FooProp"" ref=""Injectable /&gt;\n&lt;/object&gt;\n', 'BasePage', 'FooProp', 'IHttpModule', 'public class PageModuleInjecter : IHttpModule\n{\n  public void Dispose() {}\n\n  public void Init(HttpApplication context) {\n     context.PreRequestHandlerExecute += context_PreRequestHandlerExecute;\n  }\n\n  void context_PreRequestHandlerExecute(object sender, EventArgs e) {\n    IHttpHandler handler = ((HttpApplication )sender).Context.Handler;\n    if (handler is BasePage)\n        Spring.Context.Support.WebApplicationContext.Current\n           .ConfigureObject(handler, typeof(BasePage).FullName);\n  }\n}\n', 'IHttpModule', 'BasePage', 'public abstract class BasePage : System.Web.UI.Page\n{\n   public IInjectable FooProp {get;set;}\n\n   protected override OnPreInit(EventArgs e)\n   {\n       Spring.Context.Support.WebApplicationContext.Current\n           .ConfigureObject(this, typeof(BasePage).FullName);\n       base.OnPreInit(e);\n   }\n}\n', 'public abstract class BaseControl : System.Web.UI.UserControl\n{\n   public IInjectable FooProp {get;set;}\n\n   protected override OnInit(EventArgs e)\n   {\n       Spring.Context.Support.WebApplicationContext.Current\n          .ConfigureObject(this, typeof(BaseControl).FullName);\n       base.OnInit(e);\n   }\n}\n']",False

2237589,Pros and Cons on designing a calculator with eval,"I'm making a calculator for android using kivy and it's almost done (cannot use java becasue python is the only language I know). The way it works is, the user inputs an expression and eval is used to evaluate that expressions. At the moment, in my app, the eval expression can contain numbers, mathematical operators (+, -, /, *) and most of the operators from math module (In short, it's a scientific calculator) and it works as intended. In future I'm planning on integrating matplotlib to add graphical capabilities to the app. So within the context, is eval a safe option. Given my limited experience in programming I didn't think of eval as being an unsafe method in a lot of situations, it was just a few days ago when I stumbled upon a thread which discussed the safety issues associated with using eval. So is it better to change the eval to something else within my app or is it safe in the given situation? if yes to the former, what's the best alternative without changing my code too much. Also it'd be better if it is in the python standard library so that I don't increase the app size) Edit: Btw, the eval expression is calculated in real time (not sure if this matters).",[],False

2285649,Measure on Baire space,"Inspired by the first parenthetical sentence of Joel's answer to this question, I have the following question: is there any useful notion of measurability in the Baire space $\omega^\omega$? Some initial thoughts: Any countably additive, translation-invariant measure has to give measure 0 to any set of the form $$\lbrace f: \sigma\prec f\rbrace.$$ The same holds if we ask for a finitely additive translation-invariant measure which gives finite measure to the whole space. There are several natural surjections $\omega^\omega\rightarrow 2^\omega$, and the latter space has a nice measure theory; so we could, for any such surjection $s$, define a ""measure"" given by $m_s(X)=m(s[X])$. However, it's unclear to me that any of these would be particularly interesting. Even short of a decent ""measure"" on $\omega^\omega$ (and indeed, I believe none exists), we might still be able to talk about subsets of $\omega^\omega$ being ""measurable"" or ""non-measurable"" in terms of what sorts of pathologies they admit. For example, call $X\subseteq\omega^\omega$ definably measurable if $L(\mathbb{R}, X)\models $ ""Every set is measurable."" This is, however, a terrible notion of measurability: there are measure zero (and hence measurable) sets $X\subseteq 2^\omega$ such that $L(\mathbb{R}, X)$ contains a non-measurable set, so this is too restrictive.

I am storing track data in an NSMutableDictionary that stores individual track data in NSMutableDictionaries keyed by trackID. These individual track dictionaries have at least the following keys: TrackID Name Artist Duration (in milli ####.####) To determine if any tracks match one another, I must check: If the duration of two tracks are within 5 seconds of each other Name matches Artist matches The slow way for me to do it is using two for-loops: This becomes quite slow for large music libraries, and only uses 1 processor. One recommended optimization was to use blocks and process the tracks in batches (of 100 tracks). I tried that. If my code originally took 9 hours to run, it now takes about 2 hours on a quad-core. That's still too slow. But (talking above my pay grade here) perhaps there is a way to store all the values I need in a C structure that ""fits on the stack"" and then I wouldn't have to fetch the values from slower memory. This seems too low-level for me, but I'm willing to learn if I had an example. BTW, I profiled this in Instruments and takes up 86.6% percent of the CPU time. Then I thought I should extract all the durations into a sorted array so I would not have to look up the duration value in the dictionary. I think that is a good idea, but when I started to implement it, I wondered how to determine the best batch size. If I have the following durations: Then just by iterating over the array, I know that to find matching tracks of the song at index 0, I only need to compare it against songs up to index 6. That's great, I have my first batch. But now I have to start over at index 1 only to find that it's batch should also stop at index 6 and exclude index 0. I'm assuming I'm wasting a lot of processing cycles here determining what the batch should be/the duration matches. This seemed like a ""set"" problem, but we didn't do much of that in my Intro to Algorithms class. My questions are: 1) What is the most efficient way to identify matching tracks? Is it something similar to what's above? Is it using disjoint and [unified] set operations that are slightly above my knowledge level? Is it filtering arrays using NSArray? Is there an online resource that describes this problem and solution? I am willing to restructure the tracks dictionary in whatever way (datastructure) is most efficient. I had at first thought I needed to perform many lookups by TrackID, but that is no longer the case. 2) Is there a more efficient way to approach this problem? How do you rock stars go from paragraph 1 to an optimized solution? I have searched for the answer, longer than I care to admit, and found these interesting, but unhelpful answers: find duplicates Find all duplicates and missing values in a sorted array Thanks for any help you can provide, Lance","['-(void)findDuplicateTracks {\n\n    NSArray *allTracks = [tracks allValues];\n\n    BOOL isMatch = NO;\n\n    int numMatches = 0;\n\n    // outer loop\n\n    NSMutableDictionary *track      = nil;\n    NSMutableDictionary *otherTrack = nil;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; [allTracks count]; i++) { \n\n        track = [allTracks objectAtIndex:i];\n\n        NSDictionary *summary = nil;\n\n        if (![claimedTracks containsObject:track]) {\n\n            NSAutoreleasePool *aPool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];\n\n            NSUInteger duration1  = (NSUInteger) [track objectForKey:kTotalTime];\n            NSString *nName       = [track objectForKey:knName];\n            NSString *nArtist     = [track objectForKey:knArtist];\n\n\n            // inner loop - no need to check tracks that have\n            // already appeared in i\n\n            for (int j = i + 1; j &lt; [allTracks count]; j++) { \n\n                otherTrack = [allTracks objectAtIndex:j];\n\n                if (![claimedTracks containsObject:otherTrack]) {\n\n                    NSUInteger duration2 = (NSUInteger)[otherTrack objectForKey:kTotalTime];\n\n                    // duration check\n                    isMatch = (abs(duration1 - duration2) &lt; kDurationThreshold);\n\n                    // match name\n                    if (isMatch) {\n\n                        NSString *onName = [otherTrack objectForKey:knName];\n\n                        isMatch = [nName isEqualToString:onName];\n                    }\n\n                    // match artist\n                    if (isMatch) {\n\n                        NSString *onArtist = [otherTrack objectForKey:knArtist];\n\n                        isMatch = [nArtist isEqualToString:onArtist];\n\n                    }\n\n                    // save match data\n                    if (isMatch) {\n\n                        ++numMatches;\n\n                        // claim both tracks\n                        [claimedTracks addObject:track];\n                        [claimedTracks addObject:otherTrack];\n\n                        if (![summary isMemberOfClass:[NSDictionary class]]) {\n\n                            [track setObject:[NSNumber numberWithBool:NO] forKey:@""willDelete""];\n                            summary = [self dictionarySummaryForTrack:track];\n\n                        }\n\n\n                        [otherTrack setObject:[NSNumber numberWithBool:NO] forKey:@""willDelete""];                        \n                        [[summary objectForKey:kMatches] \n                                            addObject:otherTrack];\n\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n\n            [aPool drain];\n        }\n    }\n}\n', '[NSCFSet member:]', '    2 2 3 4 5 6 6 16 17 38 59   Duration\n    0 1 2 3 4 5 6  7  8  9 10   Index\n']",False

Through this progress I think I can improve my own javascript skill and many things about network service development. A simple blog is a good start to go, then I find out that nodejs on Github and other node-based web frameworks: express, locomotive, railway, etc... problem is they have too many forks. Surely that I can work with some of them by my efforts, because the MVC logic seems the same to all. The point is that I want to focus on one framework which is the trend for next 1 year or more later. Express seems well, says railway, locomotive are based on Express, I'll be good if I follow Express at last, but then I found Meteor and Derby. Now it does mess me a lot about choices. People said that use proper tool for your own task, here now I'm having time to waste on some, but not all of them. I think I should clear up some of my thoughts by questioning: Is that meteor and derby are forks of nodejs?

2632614,taint-mode perl: preserve suid when running external program via system(),"I'm trying to add a feature to a legacy script. The script is suid, and uses perl -T (taint mode: man perlsec), for extra security. The feature I need to add is implemented in Python. My problem is that I can't convince perlsec to preserve the suid permissions, no matter how much I launder the environment and my command lines. This is frustrating, since it preserves the suid for other binaries (such as /bin/id). Is there a undocumented special case for /usr/bin/perl? This seems unlikely. Does anyone know a way to make this work? (As-is: We don't have the resources to re-architect this whole thing.) Solution: (as per @gbacon) Gives the desired results!

I will post the code I have so far below along with a link to the site that contains the widget in the sidebar. I am new to Wordpress Widget design so help would be greatly appreciated. http://www.modmacro.us/wpsandbox/","['the_excerpt', '&lt;?php\n/*\nPlugin Name: News Recent Posts Widget\nPlugin URI: \nDescription: A recent post widget with extra functions for client management\nAuthor: Kevin Ullyott\nVersion: 1.0\nAuthor URI: http://modmacro.com/\n*/\n\n\nclass recentpost extends WP_Widget {\n\n    public function __construct() {\n    parent::WP_Widget(\n    // or parent::__construct(\n        false, \n        \'Kevin - Recent Posts Widget\',\n        array(\n            \'description\' =&gt; __(\'A recent post widget with extra functions for client management\') \n\n        )\n    );\n    ;\n}\n\n    public function widget( $args, $instance ) {\n\n\n        extract( $args );\n\n        $headline = $instance[\'headline\'];\n        $category = $instance[\'category\'];\n        $numberposts = $instance[\'numberposts\'];\n        $readmore = $instance[\'readmore\'];\n\n\n        echo $before_widget;\n\n        echo $before_title;\n\n        echo ""&lt;p class=\\""headline\\""&gt;$headline&lt;/p&gt;"";\n\n        echo $after_title;\n\n        $args = array( \'numberposts\' =&gt; $numberposts, \'category_name\' =&gt; $category );\n        $recent_posts = wp_get_recent_posts( $args );\n        foreach( $recent_posts as $recent ){\n        setup_postdata(get_post($recent[\'ID\']));\n        echo \'&lt;a href=""\' . get_permalink() . \'"" title="" \'.esc_attr(get_the_title()).\'"" &gt;\' .   get_the_title().\'&lt;/a&gt; \';\n        echo get_the_time(\'F j, Y\', $recent[\'ID\']);\n        the_excerpt();\n}\nwp_reset_postdata();\n\n\n        echo $after_widget;\n\n\n    }\n\n    public function update( $new_instance, $old_instance ) {\n        $instance = array();\n        $instance[\'headline\'] = ( $new_instance[\'headline\'] );\n        $instance[\'category\'] = ( $new_instance[\'category\'] );\n        $instance[\'numberposts\'] = ( $new_instance[\'numberposts\'] );\n        $instance[\'readmore\'] = ( $new_instance[\'readmore\'] );\n        return $instance;\n    }\n\n\n    public function form( $instance ) {\n\n        $headline = $instance[ \'headline\' ];\n        $category = $instance[ \'category\' ];\n        $numberposts = $instance[ \'numberposts\' ];\n        $readmore = $instance[ \'readmore\' ];\n\n        ?&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\n  &lt;label for=""&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;get_field_id( \'headline\' ); ?&gt;""&gt;\n    &lt;?php _e( \'Headline:\' ); ?&gt;\n  &lt;/label&gt;\n  &lt;input class=""widefat"" id=""&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;get_field_id( \'headline\' ); ?&gt;"" name=""&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;get_field_name( \'headline\' ); ?&gt;"" type=""text"" value=""&lt;?php echo esc_attr( $headline ); ?&gt;"" /&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;label for=""&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;get_field_id( \'category\' ); ?&gt;""&gt;\n  &lt;?php _e( \'Category:\' ); ?&gt;\n&lt;/label&gt;\n&lt;input class=""widefat"" id=""&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;get_field_id( \'category\' ); ?&gt;"" name=""&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;get_field_name( \'category\' ); ?&gt;"" type=""text"" value=""&lt;?php echo esc_attr( $category ); ?&gt;"" /&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;label for=""&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;get_field_id( \'numberposts\' ); ?&gt;""&gt;\n  &lt;?php _e( \'Number of posts:\' ); ?&gt;\n&lt;/label&gt;\n&lt;input class=""widefat"" id=""&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;get_field_id( \'numberposts\' ); ?&gt;"" name=""&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;get_field_name( \'numberposts\' ); ?&gt;"" type=""text"" value=""&lt;?php echo esc_attr( $numberposts ); ?&gt;"" /&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;label for=""&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;get_field_id( \'readmore\' ); ?&gt;""&gt;\n  &lt;?php _e( \'Read More:\' ); ?&gt;\n&lt;/label&gt;\n&lt;input class=""widefat"" id=""&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;get_field_id( \'readmore\' ); ?&gt;"" name=""&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;get_field_name( \'readmore\' ); ?&gt;"" type=""text"" value=""&lt;?php echo esc_attr( $readmore ); ?&gt;"" /&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;?php \n    }\n}\n\nadd_action( \'widgets_init\', create_function(\'\', \'return register_widget(""recentpost"");\') );\n\n\n?&gt;\n']",False

2786750,Preventing Focus-able Controls from stealing Keyboard Input,"I'm currently working on a simple game that is drawn on a form by overriding the method. The game requires Keyboard input and was working perfectly until I decided to enhance the GUI and add a few Buttons to the form. The moment I added these Buttons, the form stopped receiving any Keyboard input, no matter how hard I tried the focus was always on the buttons. This behavior can be replicated by placing any Focus-able Control on the form. (ie. TextBox) I don't need ANY Kayboard interaction with these buttons, I want the user to interact with them with the mouse only. I've tried the following techniques to try and get around this problem - none of these worked: 1) Normal and events of the form. (This is the way I was capturing Keyboard input before placing the buttons.) 2) Overriding the Form's and events. 3) Overriding - Works, but cannot differentiate between KeyUp and KeyDown events, so it is inadequate for me. I also tried create a MessageFilter for the application, but I couldn't force it to capture only the Keyboard keys that I needed. I've been looking into this for many hours already and can't find a suitable solution. Help would be greatly appreciated.","['OnPaint', 'KeyDown', 'KeyUp', 'OnKeyDown', 'OnKeyUp', 'ProcessCmdKey']",False

2796952,"Android App only working One time, then crashes","Okay so I am having a problem getting my app to work. Basically I have an game that needs to get a few pictures and Strings from the user. I have an opening screen (OpeningScreen) that acts as a splash screen that opens up the menu (MenuScreen). From there the user can pick to go to the game or go to the activity that shows the current pictures (PickScreen). The user can go to that activity and from there open up another activity that gives a larger version of the picture they currently have picked or a default picture (PicOne). Here the user has the option to take a new picture and change the current Strings. For the most part all of it works great. My problem occurs when: After the user picks a picture and backs out of the app. The next time they open it, it will force close either when I go back to PickScreen or after I press done after taking a new picture and sometimes when I go to PicOne activity. It does not do the same thing everytime, it just crashes at one of those points. The other issue happens when I change the 3 String names. After pressing save and going back to PickScreen, the app crashes when going back to PicOne or if I back out of the app crashes when going from MenuScreen to PickScreen. I know this is a lot of code to look at, but I have spent a lot of time looking around and getting code from different places for this app and I am at a point that I cannot figure out. I figure there are many people with more knowledge than me out there, so I am asking for your help. I know that you cannot just ask a question without showing you have been doing any work, so here it is. Why does may app work perfectly once and then crash in various spots the second time in? By the way it does work fine after the force close, again only once. And why does it force close when I change the Strings? Thanks everyone!!

2832020,Dynamic XML sources,"I want to be able to extract data from an XML. I know form which tags I want the data. This is not hard to achieve. But I also want to be able to add additional XML sources. The data I want will be the same on all sources but it will reside under different tags, meaning the data from the xmls will map to the same variables in my program. These are sources and tags I don’t know before hand so it needs to be dynamic. There will also be a lot of data surrounding the desired data which I’m not interested in. If this in unclear I can write an example. After some researching I basically came up with two solutions. The first is to create a separate file where I specify where the data is located in the XML by absolute url(like /root/parent/child), and to which data it corresponds to in my program. From there I can parse the xml and look for the tags and store them. I can’t use xPath as I don’t want to have to parse the entire XML as they are potentially very large. The other idea I had were to write all new nodes to a different XML, apply a XSL to it, which would be different for each source, into a common format for all streams containing all relevant data. As stated in the previous solution I don’t want to apply the XSL to the entire document as it is potentially very large. (Maybe writing to a new XML and applying the XSL there will be more timeconsuming. I guess it depends on the size of the XML but I’m not exactly sure atm.) Both solution will use an XML to store the sources and in the first solution also store the mappings, and in the second solution store the name of the XSL I guess. My question is. Is there already a solution to this out there? I looked at JAXB but from what I gather it is not possible... If there isn’t are my solutions ok? Or perhaps you have better idea? Edit: I should perhaps have mentioned that these XMLs are streams and will have to be read over and over again to collect new data.",[],False

2838292,Implement and represent polyadic operations,"I'm not sure I even know how to ask this question .. In implementing a compiler I would like to allow the client to specify, say, folds on tuples. I have provided a way to curry and uncurry a function, but only because I wrote a binary operator in Ocaml and folded it over the term and type representations. The user could not write this function. In the macro processor, the user can write this function because tuples are lists. For curried functions, the user can easily write transformers, because the term is binary in both the target language and the Ocaml representation of the term and the typing. But they can't do this for tuples. Here's another example: the user easily defines serial functional composition operator. But the user cannot define parallel composition: the binary version: is easily written, but cannot be extended to 3 terms: here a fold would compute instead of [isomorphic but not equal] The generalisation of this question is ""How do I implement a polyadic programming language"" which is a bit too much to ask here. What I tried to do was provide a builtin transformer: .. T1 * T2 * T3 so then the user could just do folds with a binary operator: but this is neither general enough nor works so well.. :) I guess an equivalent question for Haskell would be: since Haskell has no n-ary products, the n-ary tuple constructors is simulated in the library with n functions, where each one has to be written out by hand. This clearly sucks. How would this be fixed?

Sometimes I will come to the grid and everything will load fine and sometimes, I will go to the grid and it won't show anything. I am using the data view and getting my data through ajax. I am pulling all of my data first and then instantiating the grid and data view. I have been going through my code all day and am stumped as to what could be causing this. Doing my ajax call (All data comes back as it should) Below is how I am loading the grid The grid comes back, the data just does not get loaded. Also, the correct number of rows should be 312. Below is the html after the grid is instantiated.","['function LoadGrid() {\n  dataView = new Slick.Data.DataView({ inlineFilters: true });\n  grid = new Slick.Grid(""#grid"", dataView, columns,

At first when I looked at the code I saw that there is no case for in system message handler function, so when system asks to render nothing valid is placed to clipboard, so I added something like this: and hope (actually, I knew that won't gonna work, but gave this way a try) that the system will recognize that I'm going to give as a response for a data and the system will convert in automatically.

This does not happen at any of our other labs/buildings, but we have eliminated every on site possibility we can think of.

2994121,Hard to decide between XML serialization options available in .NET,"Until last night, I've been parsing XML using a variety of libraries in .NET -- and mostly. I'm not sure why I didn't look into this sooner, but it occurred to me that there must be something available in .NET that gives you class serialization / deserialization for free, and of course that comes in the form of the class. Sure enough, by using a few lines of code, I was able to serialize and deserialize with ease (although in the code I'm currently writing, I only need to deserialize), and no longer had to take the few hours or so to write my own class to do this with other libraries, plus the requisite unit tests. But the problem is that I would like my properties to be read-only. If I make the setter private, then upon creation of the XmlSerializer I get this error: Unable to generate a temporary class (result=1). error CS0200: Property or indexer 'MyProperty' cannot be assigned to -- it is read only It looks like this is an issue that won't be resolved, so there must be a workaround. Sure enough, I found this information, which indicates that you can get the code to compile if you give up auto properties and just back with private fields. Unfortunately, while this compiles, when you execute the code, it doesn't actually deserialize the data. After stopping my application, I noticed several entries in the Messages window that said this: Could not find schema information for the element 'MyProperty'. And this is because there's no code to assign a value to MyProperty, because XmlSerializer doesn't know how to deal with private fields!!! I found an answer on StackOverflow that presents another solution, which is to use a which I hadn't heard of before. I made the necesary code changes to my class, but ended up with the same messages as above. I ran the code to be sure, and the class members don't get set when the XML is deserialized. I'm thinking that in my particular case, I either suck it up and allow the members to get overwritten (bad), or I go back to my original way of doing things, which is to just write all of the serialization / deserialization code myself. Is there something I'm doing wrong here, or is it impossible to allow a class like XmlSerializer to set private members of a class during deserialization, while making the consumer of the class not be able to overwrite its members? UPDATE: and yet another article that shows another way to do deserialization of private properties, but I just tried it and it also doesn't work. Here are some examples of the class that I've tried to deserialize: Result: when deserializing with the XmlSerializer, there are no errors, but _port and Port have a value of 0 when my XML file has a Port value of 1, e.g. . Another example: Result: deserializes fine, but I don't want a public setter. I deserialize the class like this:","['XmlDocument', 'XDocument', 'XmlSerializer', 'DataContractSerializer', '[Export]\n[DataContract]\npublic class Configuration\n{\n    [DataMember(Name=""Port"")]\n    private int _port;\n    public int Port { get { return _port; }}\n}\n', '&lt;Port&gt;1&lt;/Port&gt;', '[Export]\npublic class Configuration\n{\n    public int Port { get; set; }\n}\n', 'XmlSerializer serializer = new XmlSerializer(typeof(Configuration));\nFileStream reader = new FileStream( ""config.xml"", FileMode.Open);\nConfiguration Config = (Configuration)serializer.Deserialize( reader);\nreader.Close();\n']",False

3006783,TIBCO BusinessWorks opinion,"I've participated recently in a few projects using Tibco BusinessWorks, ranging from very simple integration projects to a quite complex application. I would appreciate to hear some opinions about this platform. Because, honestly, I've ended up with a lot of doubts about the usefulness of this tool. From my experience it seems good for small projects involving different sources of data. For example, building a web-service that acceses a database or another web-service, then make a little filtering or processing and return a response. That kind of thing can be done really quickly, that part is true. But I've seen a few problems: If the project grows in complexity: everything becomes a real mess. It is not actually a programming language, it uses a combination of XML/Xpath/XSLT to deal with data, which is good for simple operations but it is a hell if you need to build a ""business logic"" with it. Teamwork: more than two people working on the same project becomes complicated. All project files are confusing XML's that are almost imposible to merge safely if you are using a source control tool (which obviously you do in a real project). Also the lack of integration with these tools makes things worse as you have to deal with extra problems. To be fair we've only used SVN, maybe there are better choices, I don't know. Project management: the deployment system is very simple, that is a good thing if you only have to do one deployment. The problem is that it is so simple that becomes unflexible. I know there are ways to automatize tasks, AppManage.exe, and other obscure and undocumented command line tools. Anyway, I also find the deployment variables not easy to maintaint when there are several enviroments (test, production, etc). IDE: Of course, there is no choice here, there is only one possible IDE, the BW Designer, which is in my opinion, slow, sometimes buggy, not user friendly and not configurable at all. Productivity: Probably this is supposedly the main advantage of BW, but from my experience the productivity drops dramatically when the complexity of the project increases only a little bit. Actually, it is an old story: simplicity vs flexibility. If the tool allows you to something, then it is very easy to do it, if not... it is harder than it should. Why is this platform becoming so popular lately? What is the benefit against other widely used tools/enviroments such as java and any combination of framework, IDE, libraries, SCM, etc.?

There is an echo problem that occurs when users do not use headsets (mostly on laptops with built-in microphones). What currently happens The nuts and bolts of the VOIP application is just the plain datalines of Java's media framework. Essentially, I'd like to perform some digital signal processing on audio data before I write it to the speaker for output. As you can see the audio data arrives and is enqueued in a buffer. This is to cater for dodgy connections and to allow for different packet sizes. It also means I have access to as much audio data as I need for any fancy DSP operations before I play the audio data to the speaker line.

3020280,"Accelerated C++, problem 5-6 (copying values from inside a vector to the front)","I'm working through the exercises in Accelerated C++ and I'm stuck on question 5-6. Here's the problem description: (somewhat abbreviated, I've removed extraneous info.) 5-6. Write the extract_fails function so that it copies the records for the passing students to the beginning of students, and then uses the resize function to remove the extra elements from the end of students. (students is a vector of student structures. student structures contain an individual student's name and grades.) More specifically, I'm having trouble getting the vector.insert function to properly copy the passing student structures to the start of the vector students. Here's the extract_fails function as I have it so far (note it doesn't resize the vector yet, as directed by the problem description; that should be trivial once I get past my current issue.) The code compiles and runs, but the students vector isn't adding any student structures to its front. My program's output displays that the students vector is unchanged. Here's my complete source code, followed by a sample input file (I redirect input from the console by typing "" &lt; grades"" after the compiled program name at the command prompt.) Sample input file: Moo 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 Fail1 45 55 65 80 90 70 65 60 Moore 75 85 77 59 0 85 75 89 Norman 57 78 73 66 78 70 88 89 Olson 89 86 70 90 55 73 80 84 Peerson 47 70 82 73 50 87 73 71 Baker 67 72 73 40 0 78 55 70 Davis 77 70 82 65 70 77 83 81 Edwards 77 72 73 80 90 93 75 90 Fail2 55 55 65 50 55 60 65 60 Thanks to anyone who takes the time to look at this!","['// Extract the students who failed from the ""students"" vector.\nvoid extract_fails(vector&lt;Student_info&gt;&amp;

Here is the test code: This passes on Linux, but fails on the Mac, with this error report: BUT when I isolate the offending code, it outputs the same on both: That gives the same indentation on both platforms.

3079252,How to handle AJAX request in my PHP MVC?,"I am in the process of learning the MVC pattern and building my own lightweight one in PHP Below is a basic example of what I have right now. I am a little confused on how I should handle AJAX requests/responses though. In my example user controller below, If I went to in the browser, it would create a and call the of that object The would then get the data needed for the content portion of my page. My app would load a template file with a header/footer and insert the content from the object above into the middle of the page. Now here is where I am confused, if a request is made using AJAX then it will call a page that will do the process over, including loading the template file. IF an AJAX call is made, I think it should somehow, just return the body/content portion for my page and not build the header/footer stuff. So in my MVC where should I build/load this template file which will have the header/footer stuff? ANd where should I detect if an AJAX request is made so I can avoid loading the template? I hope I am making sense, I really need help in figuring out how to do this in my MVC I am building.

First thing I would like to have is a distributed filesystem with some redundancy, at least if one disk fails I'd like to lose no file. Apparently something for HadoopFS and some FUSE mounter? Anything better? Now, aside of this big file system, it is supposed to be a playground for Hadoop and cloud stacks, and I would like to maintain some chroot environments for ""Redhat only packages"" and stuff like that, and of course I would like to stay with OSS and no kernel patches or other anomalies. So, I'd like to hand-install one machine with a few chroot stacks (one Redhat clone and one Ubuntu 12.10 seem necessary), replicate these stacks everywhere and start/stop them at will across all of the machines or subsets, for example half the machines ""running"" Redhat and half 12.10. Of course I would like to have all kinds of metrics. I am willing and hopefully able to package my ""solution"" so that others can quickly achieve the same results, but should I work around Puppet or some other method is better? Previous answers indicate Beowulf and Virtual Server mechanisms which apparently fell out of fashion? I guess a company with enough money would meet some of these requirements with VMware products and similar. PS with multiple chroot environments the choice of Ubuntu 12.04 becomes irrelevant, how woould you go about setting up such a cluster from scratch, with Rocks perhaps?",[],False

3092180,"Elementary proof of $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_n)\cap \mathbb{Q}(\zeta_m)=\mathbb{Q}$ when $\gcd(n,m)=1$.","In an answer to another question I used the fact that $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_m)\subseteq \mathbb{Q}(\zeta_n)$ if and only if $m$ divides $n$ (here $\zeta_n$ stands for a primitive $n$th root of unity, Edit: and neither $m$ nor $n$ is twice an odd number; see KCd comments below). More generally, one can show that $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_n)\cap \mathbb{Q}(\zeta_m)=\mathbb{Q}$ when $\gcd(n,m)=1$. The only proof of this fact that comes to mind uses facts about discriminants of cyclotomic extensions, and the fact that every non-trivial number field extension over $\mathbb{Q}$ ramifies at least at one prime (see, for instance, Washington, ""Introduction to Cyclotomic Fields"", Chapter 2, Proposition 2.4). Since the original question that I was trying to answer was somewhat elementary, I was left wondering if there are more elementary proofs of the fact $$\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_n)\cap \mathbb{Q}(\zeta_m)=\mathbb{Q}, \text{ when } \gcd(n,m)=1. $$ By ""elementary proof"" here I mean some proof that does not involve algebraic number theory results about discriminants, or ramification of primes in rings of integers of number fields. Can anyone think of an elementary proof? Thanks!",[],False

Consider you have an array of game components. They all are called to do some stuff at every game loop iteration. For example: Benefits: good component-based application, no dependencies, good modularity we can activate/deactivate, register/unregister components dynamically some components can be transparently removed or replaced and the system still will be working as nothing have happened (change 2d to 3d)(team-work: every programmer creates his/her own components and does not require other components to compile the code) Doubts: inner loop in the game loop with virtual calls to Component::run() I would like Component::run() to return bool value and check this value. If returned false, component must be deactivated. So inner loop becomes more expensive. Well, how good is this solution?

When I press the stop button, the DispatcherTimers thread exits.

Let's say you are MD5-ing the user password once and storing the hash as password in database and someday hackers pwned your database and now they have many md5 hashes and e-mail addresses. Surely they'll look up passwords and when they got a preindexed match, they will try to login to that user's e-mail account.

When this arrayList is returned to the blazeds it consumed huge memory in JVM and also the memory usage for that client web browser also increased. Moreover the occupied huge memory is not garbage collected in JVM. This finally results in out of memory error as more request comes in.

I used to have either OpenSuse or Windows Server 2008 installed but I would like to get into VMWare Hypervisor. My hardware configuration: - Intel S5000PSL with bios version S5000.86B.10.60.0091 build date 10/09/2008 as of read out of bios - E5420 @ 2.5GHz Intel Xeon CPU The Intel Virtualization Technology is enabled in the BIOS - DVD DH20A4P DVD Writer - 8GB ECC Ram I have configured a RAID 0 on my 2 WD 2TB SATA drives I have burned the Hypervisor 5 on an empty DVD and it is bootable, I tested it on my client PC. The main problem here is basically, that I cannot boot the DVD on my server. I have set the Boot Option to the DVD drive. I have booted from the BIOS straight in the DVD drive and it does not work. I do not see any error messages. The only thing I see are the PXE error messages when it tries booting from the network and other devices, obviously without any result. Does anybody know why I cannot boot the DVD? What could cause the problem? I have sucessfully installed Windows Server 2008 via original DVD about 1 year ago, so the DVD drive can read and does work. The DVD drive is available in the BIOS and I have checked all cables and none of them is loose in any way. I even see the light flashing but it does not want to boot from the DVD. I am looking forward to suggestions and things that I should check. Thank you very much",[],False

3206864,Windows 7 Automatically Connecting To Unsecured Wireless Networks On Startup,"Most of the questions on this topic related to folks connecting to somebody else's wireless network when their own was available and could remedy the situation by going to their connections and unchecking the ""connect automatically"" box. See this: "" Avoid automatically connecting to wireless network on windows 7 "" as an example. In my situation, I've noticed that Win 7 will automatically connect to any unsecured wifi network - even if I have never connected to it in the past. If I am traveling and boot Win 7, it will start and connect to what appears to be the best signaled unsecured network without prompting me for confirmation (note: in the above link, ""Naveen"" seems to have same problem). Obviously, that is a security concern to me. Further, when I open ""Network and Sharing"" and ""Manage wireless networks"" the network is not displayed (probably because I labelled it a public network). Again, these are new, never connected with before, wireless networks. I always promptly disconnect from them but don't want to have to be on constant guard for an auto connection to a malicious network. This began about a month ago, as I recall, Win 7 did not behave like this in the past, I didn't monkey with wifi settings, and don't use a 3rd party connection manager. I did have to download some internet security certificates for army website access but I don't think that should mess with network settings.

The original software was written for Windows XP as a DLL, and talked with the device via Adaptec's ASPI API. ASPI didn't really have any security, so any application run by any user could use my DLL to talk to one of these devices, and everything worked great. I'm now updating the software to work with Windows 7 using Microsoft's modern SPTI (SCSI Pass-Through Interface) API. Things work fine with SPTI under XP, but Windows 7 has much tighter security, and for normal users or even administrators, SPTI calls return an error indicating insufficient permissions. If I log in using the hidden ""Administrator"" account, my software runs fine with SPTI, but that's not an acceptable deployment option. Here are some alternatives I've looked into so far, in order of decreasing level of having to rewrite existing code: Spinning off a thread and escalating its privileges to be pretend to be ""Administrator"" so it can talk with SPTI. [I haven't been able to get this to work using LogonUser()/ImpersonateLoggedOnUser()/LoadUserProfile(); the call to LoadUserProfile() fails, and SPTI calls fail as well with an insufficient permissions error.] Writing a Windows Service that has adequate permissions to talk with SPTI, and then having my DLL talk with that service. Userspace (UMDF) driver. It would be an expensive rewrite, and it's not clear to me whether UMDF supports accessing SCSI devices. Kernel (KMDF) driver. Should work, but would be a longer, more expensive rewrite.

3487498,Explicit choice functions for finite sets in topological spaces,"When dealing with finite nonempty sets of real or natural numbers it is always possible to define a explicit choice function, that choose one (arbitrary, but well defined) element out of that set: Take for example the smallest element; or the greatest. My question is: If we are in a very much more abstract setting, like a (arbitrary) topological space $X$, is then there a way to explicitely define a choice function as above (i.e. a function that for every finite nonempty set of elements in this space returns one element of this sets) ? I'm aware that this may be a somewhat open question, since the probable answer which awaits me is, I think ""there isn't any known explicit choice function"" - but that doesn't mean it's proven that no such function exists. The use of the axiom of choice isn't allowed! Also answers that depend on the set-theoretical construction of $X$ don't count, like always taking the element that has least amount of $\emptyset$'s in it - this is just an (incorrect - as we may consider different elements with the same amount of $\emptyset$'s ""in"" them) example of what I want to avoid. Side question: Would such a function, that depends on the set-theoretic construction of $X$, even be define in the ZFC that I'm working in, can I only define it in metamathematics ?",[],False

This is a function of , but is not defined in , so we need to write our own definition. First we need to translate the SHELLSTATE structure. Now I have only limited experience in C, but I suppose that "": 1"" means that the member of the structure is a single bit, that is, that eight of them can be packed together in a byte. I also suppose that = = 32-bit unsigned integers and that = are 32-bit signed integers. But then we have a problem: The entire structure will then occupy 228 bits, or 28.5 bytes, which is ... rather impossible, at least in Delphi, where has to be an integer. Nevertheless, I tried to solve it by adding four dummy bits at the end. 232 bits = 29 bytes, which is nice. Hence I tried and then I declared (for later convenience) Now I felt ready to define But before I tried the code, I noticed something very strange. I found that the constants I declared were already declared here: SSF Constants. Notice that . If the constants really are masks used together with , then it makes no sense to define as 2^14 when it is the 13th bit (and its mask should be 2^12) in the structure.

The browser then renders the table box outside the right border. This can be fixed by individually giving the cells a px-based padding.

If table is large in size (ie. few million rows) but very slowly growing or is almost constant in size those rows will never be reused, and only a 'vacuum full' or a full database backup and restore will reclaim space on disk. Is there a way to automatically add a column with some default value but without this behavior? For instance if there would be a way to lock a table and do the update then there would be no need for MVCC in this case.",['alter table my_table add new_column int  \nupdate table my_table set new_column = 0 \nalter table my_table alter column new_column set not null\n'],True

3553281,Zooming in/out of a TImage inside a TScrollBox to a particular focus?,"I'm making a simple control based on a (and code copied from a ) with a control. I somewhat got the zooming to work, but it doesn't necessarily zoom to a focused point - the scrollbars don't change accordingly to keep the center point in focus. I would like to be able to tell this control to tell it where to zoom the focus to. So when it zooms, the coordinates I passed will stay 'centered'. At the same time, I also need to have a which tells it to keep it centered in the current view. For example, there will be one scenario where the mouse is pointed at a particular point of the image, and when holding control and scrolling the mouse up, it should zoom in focused on the mouse pointer. On the other hand, another scenario would be sliding a control to adjust the zoom level, in which case it just needs to keep the center of the current view (not necessarily center of the image) focused. The problem is my math gets lost at this point, and I can't figure out the right formula to adjust these scroll bars. I've tried a few different ways of calculating, nothing seems to work right.

3647111,What benefits are there to storing Javascript in external files vs in the <head>?,"I have an Ajax-enabled CRUD application. If I display a record from my database it shows that record's values for each column, including its primary key. For the Ajax actions tied to buttons on the page I am able to set up their calls by printing the ID directly into their onclick functions when rendering the HTML server-side. For example, to save changes to the record I may have a button as follows, with '123' being the primary key of the record. Sometimes I have pages with Javascript generating HTML and Javascript. In some of these cases the primary key is not naturally available at that place in the code. In these cases I took a shortcut and generate buttons like so, taking the primary key from a place it happens to be displayed on screen for visual consumption: This definitely works, but it seems wrong to drive database queries based on the value of text whose purpose was user consumption rather than method consumption. I could solve this by adding a series of additional parameters to various methods to usher the primary key along until it is eventually needed, but that also seems clunky. The most natural way for me to solve this problem would be to simply situate all the Javascript which currently lives in external files, in the of the page. In that way I could generate custom Javascript methods without having to pass around as many parameters. Other than readability, I'm struggling to see what benefit there is to storing Javascript externally. It seems like it makes the already weak marriage between HTML/DOM and Javascript all the more distant. I've seen some people suggest that I leave the Javascript external, but do set various ""custom"" variables on the page itself, for example, in PHP: How is this any better than just putting all the Javascript on the page in the first place?

3650736,C++: Derived virtual function is returning strange results,"I created a derivable class with a virtual function in a .HPP file, and then gave it a default return value in the class's .CPP file.

Quick overview: I have a class (MapOverlay) that extends Overlay. The draw method basically calculates the images (bitmaps) needed and the x,y position to draw them on the screen. I then have an AsyncTask that loops through each tiles and download the images if it doesn't exist on the storage card (local caching) then once the AsyncTask has completed I then loop through the images and draw them to the canvas object that is passed into the draw method of the MapOverlay. But the bitmaps are never getting drawn. I have done some rudimentary debugging by logging the width and the height of the canvas element at the time the AsyncTask completes but it is returning 0 for them so I'm guessing that the canvas object is no longer available to the code running in AsyncTask's onPostExecute() after the draw method has completed Without the threading I had this working pretty well, except for the ""freezing"" while panning while the image downloading blocks the UI thread. Now I'm totally suck trying to get threading to work",[],False

I think I have managed to get the set-up working. Here is my code: I'm including the server and the client in the same file for simplicity of testing. So supposing the connection is successfully established, and I have a process on a timer (say) that was writing data to the server socket, I'd like to have the client socket 'listen' for this new data being sent from the server and then generate a callback when a write occurs (without doing something like periodically checking via a timer and a while loop to check that whether new data has been added).

3706969,Python Tkinter Text Widget with Auto & Custom Scroll,"I wrote a simple Tkinter based Python application that reads text from a serial connection and adds it to the window, specifically a text widged. After a lot of tweaks and some very strange exceptions, this works. Then I added autoscrolling by doing this: These lines run in a thread. The thread blocks on reading fromt the serial connection, splits lines and then adds all lines to the widget. This works, too. Then I wanted to allow the user to scroll which should disable auto-scroll until the user scrolls back to the bottom. I found this (Python Tkinter) Stop Text widget from scrolling when content is changed which seems to be related. Especially, I tried the code from DuckAssasin's comment: I also tried which is actually the element I want (bottom position). However, this crashes with the following exception: It seems as if tkinter somewhere returns None which then is being parsed as a float. I read somewhere, that e.g. the index method of the text widged sometimes returnes None if the requested location is not visible. Hopefully, anybody can help me out with this problem!

3748665,Build management: does this exist?,"I want something that I haven't so far been able to find in anything but theoretical papers and books. If it doesn't exist I'm rather dumbfounded because it sounds like a lot of people use these kinds of systems and that they work very well. Maybe what I need is some sort of combination of things, I'm not sure. Here are my requirements for the system: Can hook into SVN to be triggered via checkin's. Can configure independent components as project ""pipelines"" I mean that a checkin to a component triggers that component to build, run unit tests, and spit out a distributable. Can configure components that depend on other components If I check in to component A and component B depends on component A, component B has its A dependency updated and rebuilds upon completion of component A. Uses native build processes like msbuild or make. I don't have to configure something totally new just for this. If a dependency fails the upstream components do not update it, but they will update other components that did not fail. That's the build server end. I want developer side integration as well. A new developer should be able to run a command that gets everything and builds it all for the first time. This would include all components for some given project. The same build, update, build process happens on a developer's machine. Use of any IDE All of the above is automated. My team currently has this but does almost everything by hand :( What I'm describing is described in many places including the book Continuous Delivery and the paper titled Continuous Release. The closest I seem to be able to find so far is Maven, but it doesn't seem to have the ""can use native build system"" feature (you tell it each file you want built and the compiler/linker....like an XML make file). It also seems very much geared toward Java and I want something language agnostic...in fact I want something that doesn't necessarily even build programs, it could be building anything that needs some form of compilation.

However, by sending this message, they will at least be slightly more aware of fake alert viruses out there.

These viruses very closely mimic legitimate windows and mac software, so it can be hard to tell whether or not virus warnings that appear on your screen are legitimate or not. While we do have virus protection on company computers, it is still possible to get a virus by simply visiting a website… even reputable ones. If you ever have a popup that tells you that you have multiple viruses and that you need to scan your computer immediately (or do anything else), please shutdown your computer by holding down the power button until the screen turns black and contact the IT staff immediately.

The given force function $Q$ is non-negative and measurable. Consider the convex set \begin{equation} K:=\{ v \in L^{1}_{Loc}(\Omega): \nabla v \in L^{2}(\Omega) \quad \mbox{and} \quad v=u^0 \quad \mbox{on} S\}. \end{equation} We are looking for an absolute minimum of the functional \begin{equation} J(v):= \int_{\Omega}(|\nabla v|^{2} + \chi(\{v&gt;0\})Q^2) \end{equation} in the class $K$. I wish someone would remake this theorem explaining the details. I'll be very grateful. Existence theorem. If $J(u_0)&lt; \infty$ then exist an absolute minimum $u \in K$ of the functional $J$. Since $J$ is non-negative there is a minimal sequence $u_k, k \in \mathbb{N}$. Then $\nabla u_k$ are bounded in $L^{2}(\Omega)$ and since $H^{n-1}(S)$ is positive $u_k -u^0$ are bounded in $L^2(B_r \cap \Omega)$ for large $R$. Therefore there is an $u \in K$, such that for a subsequence \begin{equation} \nabla u_k \rightarrow \nabla u \quad \mbox{weakly in} \quad L^2(\Omega), \ u_k \rightarrow u \quad \mbox{almost everywhere in} \ \Omega. \end{equation} Moreover there is a function $\gamma \in L^\infty(\Omega)$ with $0 \le \gamma \le 1$, such that \begin{equation} \chi(\{u_k&gt;0\}) \rightarrow \gamma \quad \mbox{weakly star in} \quad L^\infty(\Omega). \end{equation} Then for $R&gt;0$ \begin{eqnarray} \int_{B_R \cap \Omega}(|\nabla u|^2 + \gamma \min({Q,R})^2 &amp;\le&amp; \liminf_{k} \int_{B_R \cap \Omega}(|\nabla u_k|^2 + \lim_{k}\int_{B_R \cap \Omega} \chi(\{u_k&gt;0\}) \min(Q,R)^2 \\ &amp;\le &amp; \lim_{k} J(u_k). \\ \end{eqnarray} Letting $R\rightarrow \infty$, and since $\gamma = 1$ almost everywhere in $\{u&gt;0\}$ we conclude \begin{equation} J(u) \le \int_{\Omega}(|\nabla u|^2 + \gamma Q^2) \le \lim_{k} J(u_k). \end{equation} The details can be found in the article Alt, H.

Here lies the question, how do I get the compiled GWT source from the one project, into the WAR file that'll be created by the another project?

4089241,Checking if the file exists with Htaccess,"First of all, sorry for my poor english=) I need apache work this way: When the user types in the URL like this: http://localhost/1.txt, the server must look for this file (in this example '1.txt') in the directory that is obtained by the addition of %{HTTP_HOST} and %{REQUEST_URI} to each other. Otherwise the server must load index.php that is located in the main site directory (or do any other action, no matter). In this example the file must be located in /localhost/1.txt. If the url is: http: //somesite.org/mydirectory/download/1.txt the server must look for the following file relatively to the site directory (DocumentRoot): /somesite.org/mydirectory/download/1.txt I know that mod_rewrite supports much more complex things. Here is what I've got now: It works good but when I try to write something before '%{REQUEST_URI}' apache just ignore all the condition. For example if I will write: the server will do nothing while I want it to load the file that is stored as I wonder if it is possible with only one .htaccess. Or I need to use PHP for this? Hope you understood me. Thanks in advance... SOLUTION: Ok.

This was really eye opening to me, because I would not have thought there could be a race condition in the example they provide. This article explains that writes to memory might not actually occur (from the perspective of the other cpu) in the order written in my code. This is a new concept to me! This article provides 2 solutions: Using the ""volatile"" keyword on variables that need cache consistency across multiple cpus. This is a C/C++ keyword, and not available to me in Delphi. Using InterlockExchange() and InterlockCompareExchange(). This is something I could do in Delphi if I had to. It just seems a little messy. The article also mentions that ""The following synchronization functions use the appropriate barriers to ensure memory ordering: •Functions that enter or leave critical sections"". This is the part I don't understand. Does this mean that any writes to memory that are limited to functions that use critical sections are immune from cache consistency and memory ordering issues?

I'm using PHP's IMAP functions to retrieve messages from a POP3 mailbox &amp; was wondering is there any way to tell the new messages apart from the old ones? Unfortunately I cannot just delete the ones that are retrieved as they need to stay on the mail server, so I'm now wondering that each subsequent time I connect, how can I just retrieve the new ones OR be able to tell the new ones apart from the old ones I have already retrieved previously? I know that each message has a UID attached to it &amp; I could use this.. however I've read that this can change if the messages are deleted; as the messages may be deleted from the server down the track.

I want to the site to be conventionally http://somesite.com and http://somesite.com/mobile I can see that the tables are created in the db when I add the other site, but not corresponding directories of /wpadmin, /wp-content, or /wp-includes get created anywhere. I guess I am not sure where they should get created, and what permissions I would need on that directory. I have tried using IIRF to get around the .htaccess rewrite issue, (I think) but since the correct sub-directories never get created, there is nothing to redirect to. What have I done wrong? Is it not possible to have the base site in /? but not in /inetpub/wwwroot/? I hope this is clear",[],False

For this you can build a TFS plugin which fires at the WorkItemChanged Event. However our company policies don't allow us to build these plugins because it is processed for each workitem in all projectcollections. This action is only needed for a few team projects. My question: is it possible to create some clientside plugin(perhaps a VS plugin) which fires an action on this event instead? Or is there someway to create another sort of listener to this event?

4900768,How to create a custom layer in google earth so I can set it's visibility,"I am trying to render a whole heap of vectors in the google earth plugin. I use the parseKml method to create my Kml Feature object and store it in an array. The code looks something like below. I loop over a list of 10,000 kml objects that I return from a database and draw it in the plugin. This seems to work fine. But when I want to turn the visibility of all these features on or off at once, I have to iterate over all of these kml objects in my array and set their individual visibilities on or off. This is a bit slow. If I am zoomed out, I can slowly see each of the lines disappearing and it takes about 5 - 10 seconds for all of them to disappear or come back. I was wondering if I could speed up this process by adding a layer and adding all my objects as children of this layer. This way I set the visibility of the whole layer on or off. I have been unable to find out how to create a new layer in code though. If someone can point the appropriate methods, it would be great. I am not sure if a layer is the right approach to speed up the process either. If you also have any other suggestions on how I can speed up the process of turning on/off all these objects in the map at once, that would be very helpful as well.

5044432,Android - SQLite adapter for large database (~8000 lines),"What is the best method for writing a custom adapter for a large database? The database in question is a media library which I have scanned in from user-selected sources. My goal is to cache media information into an SQLite database and then display it with a custom adapter. The database has only one table, MYLIBRARY, which stores one song information per row in this format: _ Data is scanned into the database in no particular order, I just build a list of files with a recursive directory search and then dump them into a tag reading library to extract information. My full music library is stored on my SMB server, mounted via CIFS on my tablet. I have scanned ~8000 songs into the database. Then I created a custom CursorAdapter and used this query to generate the cursor: This works nicely on the database I generated for my on-device media (which is at most 50 songs) and also works nicely on my remote library for the first 1/4 or so of the list (fast scrolling enabled). However, once I scroll deeper into the list it starts lagging and lagging and eventually shows an ANR. If I wait, it will eventually complete the scroll. As I have read in other posts, CursorAdapter does not appear to work well with large databases. I would really like to have the ability to show all media at once (I will have options to categorize by artist/year/etc but still want the option to show all). I have a few ideas that I wanted to get feedback on. 1. Limit/Offset Create a custom Adapter that queries 100-200 items at a time, and then when the end of the data is reached, query 100-200 more items. This solves the problem of eating up large RAM with 8000-line Cursors, but SQLite does not recommend this here. 2. Dual Cursor Limit/Offset To speed this up, I was also thinking about using 2 Cursors, each with 100-200 items but instead of re-querying when the list scrolls beyond the available data, asynchronously re-query the second cursor as the list scrolls half-way through the first, then swap them for smoother list scrolling. This still suffers from the offset problem mentioned on that page. 3. Comparison According to the page here, SQLite is fast when comparing to the previous first/last track. However, their example is for one data field while my query selects from a larger set. I'm not entirely sure how to implement this with the data set I'm using. 4. Re-organize data to improve speed track) and still be able to sort by multiple fields, I could change the way data is stored. So, I'm simply looking for insight on which method (or any other methods I haven't discovered) would work best. This is my first experience using SQL and I'm still fairly new to Android (coming from a C/C++ heavy background).","['id - Integer, auto-increments\n\nARTIST - Text, artist name\n\nALBUM - Text, album name\n\nYEAR - Text, song year\n\nTRACK - Integer, track number of song\n\nTITLE - Text, song title\n\nPATH - Text, full path to file\n\nTIME - Integer, total length of song\n\nDISC - Integer, used for multi-disc albums\n', 'viewCursorQuery = ""SELECT * FROM MYLIBRARY ORDER BY ARTIST, ALBUM, DISC, TRACK"";\n']",False

5149246,XML IDREF in JAXB returns the wrong class?,"I am new to both XSD design and JAXB.

In order to use JAXB with this, I created all the required classes automatically using Eclipse's JAXB Classes for Schema creation tool. It creates the following classes automatically based on the XSD file: Policy.java ActorDef.java ActorSystemDef.java ActorSystemType.java everything looks fine except for the ActorDef.java file and the type of the actorSystem variable in it which is defined using IDREF in the XSD file. Basically, ActorDef.java file has the following: The problem with this is that since the returned type from the ActorDef.getActorSystem() is of type ActorSystemType, it is a reference to the wrong object. What I want is a reference to the related ActorSystemDef so that I can call the getName() method on that to get the name of the ActorSystemDef (as can be seen below) I was able to make the code work by manually modifying the classes that were created automatically by the JAXB tool.

5158871,Learning to create beautiful /next-generation GUI,"I really want to create a stunning-looking GUI desktop application that looks like, for example: Mac OS X interface Picasa desktop client on windows IPhone apps Office 2007 I've mostly been programming GUI using Qt/Swing/WinForm and I'm tired of creating so plain looking GUI, lol. So I was thinking about diving into stuff like: jQuery WPF/C# iPhone SDK Silverlight Adobe Air/Flex Just to get some ideas on how to create really cool looking UI. Does that sound like a good list? Any developers here that could share what platform they use to create very cool looking desktop app? On a sidenote, I really wonder what developers at Apple / Microsoft use to develop their own cool-looking software. EDIT A lot of responses talk about the importance of usability over ""cool-looking"".. 3 years), so that I understand. But using cool-looking UI also improves user experience + it could make big difference on whether or not your software sells. I mean, otherwise why would Microsoft/Apple try to make their OS UI look ""cooler"" everytime there's a new version? Why would websites like pragprog.com, or versionsapp.com. make their websites look like that? Basically you kill 2 birds with one stone: stunnning-looking UI + super usability (because it looks simple and intuitive). That is what I'm striving for. And as far as I know, I cannot achieve that using Qt/Winform. Most of the books I have read just show you how to make average-looking (read: 1990's) UI. I want to learn how to create cool-looking UI. And the only place I see cool-looking UIs these days are the technology I list above. I'm not enamored with any technology; but I just want to know how things are done in other technology to see if I could apply them to the technology I'm using, or see if I could use those technology in my line of work. An example: if I were to pick between this UI and this UI, I probably would pick the latter, if just based on looks alone. Functionally, they are just the same UI; they both allow you to keep track of your time. They both contain buttons and textboxes, etc. But the fact that they look different, also differentiate them in terms of attractiveness. So in all, I think the ""ice on the cake"" is very important. I would say it's the thing you strive for after you are certain you have a totally intuitive, usable UI.",[],False

5168040,Is there a best way to organize Javascript code?,"I've been doing a small web application, adding behaviors and appending DOM objects in Javascript using jQuery. The problem is that the code is starting to grow really fast and I don't know where to store it (either in the same page it's being used, or in a big js file). At this point, I have: 1 js file with an object storing some synchronized information from a server, and with the most important methods (which should be used across the application). One of these methods include a DOM element generator (which then I add from within the desired web page). 1 js file with a big method which is called when window.ready that adds behaviors to a bunch of DOM object (only related to a webpage). Some tags filled with code in the pages that didn't use the second js file. This code is also webpage related. Now, you may be killing me with your eyes, and I know. This is definitely not a good (or at least not consistent) way to store Javascript. So, my question is: Is there a best way to organize Javascript code? I suppose that at least I should follow a rule, though the problem is that I'm not sure if it's best to have a js file for all the ""global data and methods"" and then store the other ones in smallers js files or , or simply give up and go for a tea. What do you guys think? Thanks in advance! PS: Obviously code reutilization is a good point. However, the scripts I will be reusing the most are saved in the first js file (the one with global stuff).",[],False

EDIT: Now when I tried it in the fiddle, the tiles are not loading at all with Firefox, loads fine on chrome. In my real environment, the tiles load in Firefox too after first drag of the view. EDIT2: The tiles didn't show at all in the fiddle because I had forgot to add the styles to fix bootstrap messing with the google map canvas.

5234155,When is there a unique solution for being equidistant to $N$ points in taxicab geometry?,"We place three non-overlapping, noncollinear points on an arbitrarily large grid graph (not worrying about infinities). Call these points $(p_1,p_2,p_3)$. Assuming taxicab geometry, is it possible for there to exist two or more points on the lattice, $(p_a,p_b)$, that have the same ordered set of distances to $(p_1,p_2,p_3)$? Does this hold true for a $d$-dimensional grid graph if we ask for an ordered set of distances to $d+1$ non-overlapping and noncollinear points (trivially true for $d = 1$)? Please notice that I specify the distances to each point should be an ordered set. In other words, if your set of distances to $(p_1,p_2,p_3)$ is $(d_1, d_2, d_3)$, this set of distances is distinct from, for example, $(d_2, d_1, d_3)$. In response to coffeemath's answer: The example you give (scaled by a factor of 20), yields $(p_1,p_2,p_3) = ((0,0),(-20,20),(10,10))$ and $(p_a,p_b) = ((-5,15),(-4,16))$. In taxicab geometry, we thus have $(d_1, d_2, d_3) = (20,20,20)$ for both $p_a$ and $p_b$. However, in Euclidean geometry, we have that $(d_1, d_2, d_3) = (5*10^{\frac{1}{2}},5*10^{\frac{1}{2}},5*10^{\frac{1}{2}})$ for $p_a$ and $(d_1, d_2, d_3) = (4*17^{\frac{1}{2}},4*17^{\frac{1}{2}},2*58^{\frac{1}{2}})$ for $p_b$. So the answer to my question is ""no"", a particular instance of the ordered set $(d_2, d_1, d_3)$ can exist for multiple lattice points. Followup question (while my account details are being sorted out) - Are there any simple constraints that would make my statement true? What if we have $d+2$ points for a $d$-dimensional grid graph and ask about the uniqueness of an ordered set of these points? What if we consider a hexagonal lattice version of taxicab geometry? Note to CoffeeMath: Still haven't been able to fuse my account with this one, but to respond: ""...maybe the requirement should be that the n+1 points not all lie on any hyperplane (on the analogy of for 2-space requiring no three on a line (hyperplane in two space)? For highjer dimensions I think ""no three on a line"" might be too easy."" Right, I think this is a very natural extension to the ""non collinear"" constraint I imposed in 2D. In general, we want to break any ""trivial"" axes of symmetry. In the continuum limit, we might call this randomly perturbing the vertices of the grid graph in $R^d$. Also, as a quick note, I never meant that additional dimensions would somehow constrain lower-dimensional embeddings of graphs.",[],False

I'm trying to balance the desire to track form actions accurately with the need to never prevent a form from not working. Now, I know that doing something like this doesn't work.

What if something happens between and when I get around to triggering the DOM based submit? I've totally broken the form. I've been poking around some other analytics implementations, and I've noticed something like this: Basically, instead of interrupting the form submit, preempting it by assuming that if someone is mousing down or keying down on Enter, than that form is submitted. Obviously, this will result in a certain amount of false positives, but it completely eliminates use of , which in my mind eliminates the risk that I might ever prevent a form from successfully submitting. So, my question: Is it possible to take the standard form tracking snippet and prevent it from ever fully preventing the form from submitting? Is the mousedown/keydown alternative viable?

We'd really like to keep properties of SQL Agent : the features, the usable GUI. I searched serverfault for an evaluation of different CRON GUIs / Scheduling agents, but really didn't find quite what I was looking for. So, I'd like your input. What's worked well for you, been usable. I'd especially like to hear from someone who has approached it from my point of view. What is your experience with the below 3 options? Seems like our options are so far are: PgAgent - seems just the ticket. Unfortunately, it doesn't work well with Greenplum. Also, it looks like it might be somewhat abandoned - the last release date was some time ago. But it might just be that it's so well done, it hasn't needed new releases. Job Scheduler, http://jobscheduler.sourceforge.net/, which on first glance, seems to fit pretty well. But I'm a bit concerned that it might have complications in order to generate consulting revenue. It also just doesn't 'feel' like SQL Agent, reading the docs, many of the concepts feel foreign. On the plus side, it certainly looks to be kept up. Cron learning more advanced techniques like ( Cron jobs in cascade array, job control and ssh, Can I run a cron job more frequently than every minute?, Where is this cron job running from?, Cron job unified logging ) But honestly, the techniques seem obscure, due to my background, and I'm seriously concerned that if we go down this road, we'll make serious mistakes and do some really hard learning Thank you in advance!",[],True

5360822,Make Debug/Release Build Configuration with 1 Click Publish dependent on the selected Publish Profile,"This is almost a duplicate of Link build configuration to a publish profile, but that question was not answered...

But what I REALLY want is... To set the appropriate Build Configuration from the 1 Click Publish settings. should be published with my Debug settings and should be published with the Release settings. I shouldn't have to make the change from within the Configuration Manager. But I Do. So, I have 2 questions: Am I just doing it wrong?

Milne states that if $A=\mathbb{Z}$, then the elements $\gamma_1,\dots, \gamma_m$ generate a submodule $N$ of finite index if and only if $D(\gamma_1, \dots, \gamma_m)\neq 0$. So far so good. However, he then claims that $$D(\gamma_1,\dots, \gamma_n)=(B:N)^2 \operatorname{disc}(B/\mathbb{Z}).$$ I don't see how the determinant of a change-of-basis matrix relates to the index of a submodule.

I've thought of the inverse power method but it won't work as far as I can tell. So, is there a way to find such eigenvalues ""directly""? (directly in the numerical sense that I don't have to find vectors not in the space spanned by those eigenvalues to get there) ETA: My original question is more general, but I was mostly thinking of graph Laplacian matrices when I asked this. So given a symmetrix adjacency matrix $W$ and a degree matrix $D = \textrm{diag}(W \mathbf{1})$ where $\mathbf{1}$ is a column vector of ones, the graph Laplacian is defined as $$ \mathcal{L} = D - W $$ It doesn't take much effort to show that $\mathbf{1}$ is in the nullspace of this matrix. Furthermore, any other vectors that are in its nullspace (or are eigenvectors that have zero eigenvalue) will reveal the components in the corresponding graph.

Before the switch, things were just fine. We then switched to a new network provider in the exact same building (there are multiple companies that provide network services in that data center) and things have been very troublesome... The speeds kept fluctuating and were at first extremely low, like fluctuating between 20 kBps and 100 kBps. Usually more like 20 kBps. THEN- They said they changed the port speed on their router to auto-negotiate, and that improved things a lot, but we still have serious connection issues. The speeds are now about 100-200 kBps and some people have no problems at all, but some people have a lot of trouble with speeds, and with the VDS, even some dropped connections.

My problem is: I don't know how to make the links to the rasters (from database with metadata), and I didn't find anything comprehensible enough. I have found something about data wrappers, but they seem to be intended for data with table structure, not files like rasters. DATALINK seems better, but I'm afraid it's the same case, plus I'm not sure I understood how to use it.

Access will be granted with a GUID key. No login or password required. A key will be granted to each partner authorized to access our web services. It will be generated by us and probably emailed to them. There is no expiration policy that I'm aware of. This feels wrong to me, but they're not buying my argument that there is no actual authentication in play here. What specific security risks are there with this architecture? Exactly what attack scenarios are possible and how easy would it be to compromise our systems? I need to be able to detail the risks, possibly even demonstrate them to our architecture team.",[],False
5625420,Online WYSIWYG editor using a div,"I'm trying to create a WYSIWYG editor using a div, just like Google Docs works (as far as I know). I am aware there are other, easier solution for editors, but all have one thing in common: they output terrible HTML thanks to the Javascript execCommand() function. I really need it to output clean HTML (and the same HTML across browsers), so therefore I'm thinking about writing my own editor with a regular div and some Javascript (to record click and keypresses etc.) Before I do that though, I have a couple of questions: Does the editor I'm looking for (one that outputs the same, clean HTML across browsers) already exist? Am I mistaken that it is possible to write this? Thanks a lot! Edit: I think I should have been clearer on this: I don't consider existing WYSIWYG editors (like TinyMCE or CKEditor) an option, because (and please correct me if I'm wrong) they use the Javascript execCommand() function. This (especially in combination with an iFrame in design mode, which they both use), outputs different, illogical HTML in different browsers. For example: a simple enter in Safari causes it to create a div, instead of adding a tag or create a new paragraph (). Furthermore: making text bold causes Mozilla to add , Internet Explorer and Opera to add and Safari to add a tag. Not to mention the tricks some browsers pull by adding their name to tags (Safari I'm looking at you, I don't like ). Because there's no way to change all these strange behaviors, it's very hard for me to make the site look consistent. That's the reason I'm thinking about writing my own alternative: cross-browser compatibility and consistency...","['&lt;br /&gt;', '&lt;p&gt;', '&lt;span style=""font-weight: bold""&gt;', '&lt;strong&gt;', '&lt;b&gt;', '&lt;span class=""Apple-style-span""&gt;']",False

5742336,Maven: retrieving the main module version from a sub-module,"My Maven projects are multi-module and in general the version numbers are not synced. For instance, I can have a master POM versioned as 1.2.3-SNAPSHOT and a sub-module versioned 3.4.5-SNAPSHOT (the main reason for not keeping them synced is that often a module is moved from a project to another and it has to keep its version). Now I want to put the main project version in a resource of the module containing the main (or the webapp, etc...), which of course is a sub-module. This means that I need to access the master pom version from a sub-module. Also be aware that my projects have got 3 or 4 levels; thus the master pom is the grandfather of the submodule, not just the parent. In spite of having some experience with Maven including advanced stuff, so far I've been unable to solve this problem. Thanks.",[],False

5789079,Implement INotifyCollectionChanged on a service or INotifyPropertyChanged is fine?,"Let's say I have a service whose interface is something like this: The questions comes into how I'm supposed to bind the proxies contained in the service to the view. The way I'm doing is by creating a ProxyList array on the service interface and notifying changes to that property. Like this: On the ViewModel I have another array property for the proxies. When the ViewModel is instantiated, it then subscribes to the IProxyRotator PropertyChanged event and 'forwards' the event so that the View can actually see that the proxy array changed. Like this: The problem is that the overhead of having to intercept the service PropertyChanged event and forward it bugs me, it feels.. wrong. It's also a major drawback when I have to rely on numerous different objects that implement INotifyPropertyChanged instead properly implementing INotifyCollectionChanged.

5819134,java thread sleep resolution and waiting for synchronized blocks,"I would like to know more about how the thread sleep resolution works, and what it is tied into beyond simply the resolution of sleep(). I know its defined by the operating system and that on Windows its typically 15ms. I havent been able to confirm this by looking around recently, but I vaguely recall this 15ms is looped by the OS and is 'global' to all threads, meaning that rather than 15ms being the minimum time a thread can sleep for, it is rather the maximum of sleep(1). Is that right? Is it the same for all operating systems (beyond the duration)? I cant think of a situation where this could matter, but will a spurious wakeup of a thread always occur at the action point of this sleep cycle, or can it happen at any time? On a synchronized block, are the waiting threads effectively sleep(1)-ing and checking the lock at each cycle, or does a thread exiting the block instantly wake up a waiting thread? Is this the same for all operating systems? When thread is notify()-ed after a wait(), will it be handled in the same way as above while it waits for the lock, or different? Is there any other time that the 15ms loop is relevant from a performance perspective?",[],False

5836424,UITableView separator at wrong position,"On selection I change the height of an UITableViewCell (loaded from a nib). But the separator line is at a wrong position when I do this. In the screenshot the first row is selected, and therefore bigger than the other ones. From the separator positions it looks like the cell after the selected cell would be the big one. The second cell ""has"" exactly the size the first cell should have. To change the height I save the selected indexpath in and compare it in . If the indexpaths are the same I return the increased height. With the help of some NSLog I made sure that the correct height is returned. And if I would resize the wrong cells the views of the cell would overlap, this doesn't happen. If I click of the first cell the fires and the indexpath is the one for the first cell. So I guess the heights are correct, and the tableview draws the separators on the wrong position. Does anybody has an idea what I did wrong? Any solutions? Or should I file another bug with apple?

5849950,How does Windows processor affinity work with hyperthreaded CPUs?,"How does Windows processor affinity work with hyperthreaded CPUs? Let's use an example (pictured) of a system with four cores, each with a hyper-threaded virtual core. Which cores correspond to each ""CPU"" below? Does (say) CPU 6 and CPU 7 below represent one core; the HT and the real core? If, for example, CPU 6 represents a real core and CPU 7 an HT core, will a thread assigned just to just CPU7 get only the left over resources of a real core? (assuming the core is running other tasks) Is the hyperthreaded managed entirely within the processor such that threads are juggled internally? If so, is that at the CPU scope or the core scope? Example: If CPU 6 and 7 represent one core, does it not matter which a process is assigned to because the CPU will assign resources as appropriate to a running thread? I notice that long-running single-threaded processes are bounced around cores quite a bit, at least according to task manager. Does this mean that assigning a process to a single core will improve performance by a little bit (by avoiding context switches and cache invalidations, etc.)? If so, can I know I am not assigning to ""just a virtual core""? This is all very vague and confusing to me.

The deployment guidelines for Tornado suggest one instance of the app per CPU cure so I have, in total, 32 instances of the application running. The problem I'm having with Nginx is that if something goes wrong with the app servers that causes all the instances to be unavailable (Causing a connect timeout), NGINX goes through each one of the 32 instances and checks it before returning an error. The connect timeout is set to 5 seconds so it would be over 2:30 mins before NGINX actually sent something back to the user saying it had failed. Is there any way to limit the number of servers NGINX will retry before sending an error to the user? I.E. it checks two servers then just gives up rather than cycling through all of them?",[],False
5883183,What Haskell web framework would one use for an HTTP/Websocket data and messaging platform?,"Just looking at Haskell and web frameworks and wondering if it would make sense to use Haskell's great threading/event functionality to power a platform for writing HTML5 and REST apps that expose an HTTP API for data and a WebSocket (with maybe SockJS support for appropriate fallback) API for events? It doesn't seem like the ""big"" web frameworks support WebSockets as a first-class citizen, though they seem to have a lot of other things going for them. My concern is making use of available cores, which Haskell can do well, but also providing easy user integration on the server side for validation and server-side logic (maybe by embedding Lua or similar?). If one wrote this on the JVM, one could make use of multiple server-side language support and lots of libraries for this sort of thing. I'm sure people are doing things like this in a one-off solution for their own applications but I'm thinking along the lines of a PaaS-type approach where one can write HTML5 apps with data (including proper synchronization for offline use) and eventing ""for free"" as a fundamental part of the platform. Most logic would reside in the browser but some could be run on the server with the appropriate hooks and a reasonable embeddability (JavaScript seems out of the question and not sure about embedding interpreters in Haskell as I'm only dangerously familiar with Haskell in general). Part of the problem I've had with Haskell so far is that I'm not a Math guy. I didn't study CS in college and I'm a creative-type thinker. So a lot of the tutorials and documentation get me pretty lost, especially when dealing with the mathematical stuff. Has anyone trod this path already? Am I late to the party? :)",[],False

Here is how I am updating my data: 1) I set all relevant objects of the corresponding type to ""hide form user"" (NSPredicate ensures they don't show in Table View). 2) I get an NSArray from the JSON data. 3) Looping each item, my createABookOfClass:withJSON: method queries the core data for a book (using an ID from the json dictionary), if it doesn't find it, it creates a new one. Note: at this point the ""hide from user flag"" is reverted. 4) After all is done, I save. Maybe what is happening is a cell containing Object A has been updated, it's update: the hide flag has changed. thus I am getting into a situation where the NSFetchedResultsController's delegate wants to update that cell, and delete it also... since the predicate now doesn't correspond to this object...

However, they all have a property . These objects are instantiated and put into an array (orders matter), and they are put on the screen in the same order. Scenario 1: User tabs on the first object, it becomes the first responder. User taps on another object (from the same class) and that becomes the first responder. No problem. Scenario 2: User tabs on the first object, it becomes the first responder. User taps on the button of the keyboard (iPad or iPhone or wireless keyboard), I want the next object in the array becomes the next responder. iOS picks randomly [? or with some logic not clear to me] another object which is not in the same order as I want. Problem: Because these objects are s, how can I intercept the transition to the next object. I tried using tags or tracking who is the first responder, but the problem is, if user taps on an object out of order, it is fine - I don't want to intercept that. I only want to intercept transition from one object to anther only if it is through tapping on (or or ) button of keyboard. Any idea?

5971831,PHP Installer Script,"Possible Duplicate: How I can create installer for website. PHP mysql I'm looking to create a fully functional installer for a slightly complicated web application using PHP. Basically, you go to URL/setup.php and you are asked a series of questions, and during the process a database is set up and a config file is populated according to the answers given. A good example of this is how Wordpress handles its install procedure, as well as any number of PHP applications. My question to you, oh great internet, is this: This technique is so prevalent that surely not everyone is re-inventing the wheel, is there a place I can go to find a basic walkthrough (not code, just a description) of the technique. Either that or a good book which outlines if not this specific technique, then the fundamentals relevant to this? I can bang out something ugly and probably make it work myself, but if there's a best known method I'd like to find it. Far more important than having a working function is to have a description of what's going on from step to step. I'd like to have the installer, but I really want to learn how it's done.
