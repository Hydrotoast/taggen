19529,Fourier transform on $\mathbb{R}^3$,"I've been stuck on this one homework problem for nearly a day now, so I'd be really thankful for any pointers. The problem is to find $$\int\int\int_{\mathbb{R}^3} \frac{1}{\mathbf{x}^2+1}e^{-2\pi i (x_1\zeta_1+x_2\zeta_2+x_3\zeta_3)}dx_1dx_2dx_3$$ where $\mathbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^3$. I'm not sure how to go about this; I know that the Fourier transform of $1/(1+x^2)$ in $\mathbb{R}$ is $\pi e^{-2\pi |\zeta|}$, but I don't think that helps at all. I've tried changing it to spherical coordinates as well.

39946,Is this kind of Design by Contract useless?,"I've just started informatics university and I'm attending a programming course about C(++). The programming professor prefers to connect every topic with a type of programming design that is similar to Design by Contract. Basically, what he asks us to do is to write every exercise with comments that denote the pre-condition, post-condition, and invariants that should prove the correctness of each program we write. But this doesn't make any sense to me. Maybe writing down your thoughts prevent you from making some mistakes, but if this is all an abstract thing, then if your program intuition is wrong, you'll write your program wrong, and then you'll also write pre and post conditions wrong. In the end, you'll be convinced that a wrong program might actually be correct. I had some programming experience before this course and I found myself comfortably with just writing a program and unit testing it. It takes less time to accomplish and is less ""abstract"" than just thinking about what every single piece of your program should do in every case (which is kinda like mentally testing it). Finally, determining the pre and post conditions takes me about 80% of the total time of the exercises. It's harder to think about putting down this pre and post correct than to write the program itself. Am I right in thinking that working with pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants aren't worth anything? Should I convince myself that this method is right?",[],False

67528,Most significant bit of integer multiplication and binary decision diagrams,Let $x$ and $y$ two binary numbers with $n$ bits and $z = x \cdot y\ $ the binary number (length $2n$) of the product of $x$ and $y$. We want to compute the most siginifcant bit $z_{2n-1}$ of the product $z = z_{2n-1} \ldots z_0$. In order to analyse the complexity of this function in the model of binary decision diagrams (in particular read-once branching programs) I try to look for some equivalent expressions for the case $z_{2n-1} = 1$. The first obvious thing is $z_{2n-1} = 1 \Leftrightarrow x \cdot y \geq 2^{2n-1}$ (here $x$ and $y$ are the corresponding integers to the binary numbers). I want to get an intuition what happens if I set some input bits constant. E.g. if I set the most significant input bit from $x$ and $y$ to 0 I get the constant 0 function. But bits with lower significance haven't such an influence on the result. Are there any other equivalent expressions for the case $z_{2n-1} = 1$ which help more to see what happens if I fix some input bits? Are there any refined methods to compute the product of two binary numbers which can help? Or do you have some other approach to this problem?,[],False

I have an expanding div inside my content, if the div is expanded, the scrollToFixed endpoint doesnt dynmaically increase to account for the new height. So what happens is the endpoint remains fixed to the point originally calculated when the expanding div was closed. The div then fixes itself somewere in the middle and not to the point it should fix to after the div is expanded. The easiest fix I can think of is to force scrollToFixed to recalculate the endpoint after the div is expanded, is there a way to do this? Or any other solutions are also of course welcome!",[],False

In this case there is no problem with getting some dummy instances of FolderIcon class.

335380,"Using MongoDB as our master database, should I use a separate graph database to implement relationships between entities?","We're currently in the process of implementing a CRM-like solution internally for a professional firm. Due to the nature of the information stored, and the varying values and keys for the information we decided to use a document storage database, as it suited the purposes perfectly (In this case we chose MongoDB). As part of this CRM solution we wish to store relationships and associations between entities, examples include storing conflicts of interest information, shareholders, trustees etc. Linking all these entities together in the most effective way we determined a central model of ""relationship"" was necessary. All relationships should have history information attached to them ( commencement and termination dates), as well as varying meta data; for example a shareholder relationship would also contain number of shares held. As traditional RDBMS solutions didn't suit our former needs, using them in our current situation is not viable. What I'm trying to determine is whether using a graph database is more pertinent in our case, or if in fact just using mongo's built-in relational information is appropriate. The relationship information is going to be used quite heavily throughout the system. An example of some of the informational queries we wish to perform are: Get all 'key contact' people of companies who are 'clients' of 'xyz limited' Get all other 'shareholders' of companies where 'john' is a shareholder Get all 'Key contact' people of entities who are 'clients' of 'abc limited' and are clients of 'trust us bank limited' Given this ""tree"" structure of relationships, is using a graph database (such as Neo4j) more appropriate?",[],True

356742,Android - Cropping after Camera and Gallery Intents Gives Strange Results,"I'm trying to launch an Android camera intent and a choose-photo intent (two buttons, one for take photo, one for choose from gallery) and both need a crop intent launched after them then have the cropped photo returned to my app's activity. I've gone through a bunch of the examples posted elsewhere, but I'm getting strange reults with my implementation. For the take photo event, it appears to work fine, except after taking a photo and going into crop mode, the wrong photo pops up. Instead of cropping the photo you just took it crops an older photo and I can't figure out where it's coming from. Also, sometimes after finishing the crop intent, it crashes with a nullpointerexception after Parcel.readException (can't always reproduce, but I think it haappens more if you take a picture and crop as quickly as possible). For the choose photo intent, your gallery pops up as expected but upon choosing a photo all that happens is the message ""Saved"" is toasted instead of returning to my app's activity with the image. I believe I have a misunderstanding of how the choose photo intent works (I pretty much reused the code for the take photo intent).

371995,Dynamically connect to any Service Reference,"This is a WCF project. The idea is to use this WCF Service as a ""go-between"" between my ASP.NET site and SharePoint. This way I avoid CAML in the ASP.NET site and it keeps all of the code that accesses SharePoint encapsulated inside the WCF Service. Ideally I would like this WCF service to be a .NET 4.0 project but I'm not sure if that is possible at this stage either, however if I don't directly connect to the SharePoint Object model and use OpenWeb then I think I should be OK? Any feedback on this would be great too. I have a situation where I want to ""dynamically connect"" to one of any Service References in my WCF Service code. The Service References are connecting to the _vti_bin/ListData.svc that all have identical structures (A, B and C as shown below...) so all Lists and Columns are all named the very same across multiple Site collections. The structure is like this. Root Level Site 1. ASite 2. BSite 3. CSite 4. ...and more to follow. 1-4... are all Site Collections using their own Content Databases. I have manually created the Service References and then I write the code as show below to connect in to do what I need to do with the Lists etc. My dilemma is that I dont know how to dynamically connect to any given Reference rather than writting code for each Reference. Because each reference has it's own named DataContext I dont even know if this is possible. FYI the spSite string is something like http://sps.mysite.com/sites/asite/_vti_bin/ListData.svc and http://sps.mysite.com/sites/bsite/_vti_bin/ListData.svc .... FYI. This project is using .NET 3.5 because I have a hook into the SharePoint Object Model! I would like to think that I can remove that hook and then use the .NET 4.0 framework so I could potentially us the dynamic datatype in a method that will return the correct Reference given the URI that is to be qureied by the ASP.NET site. Hope this sounds clear enough and I hope someone out there is much smarter than me and knows how I can dynamically create any Service Reference-Reference without having to copy and paste my code a million times for each Service Reference I have.

Other builds I've tried before are used to reload the full font cache in each new working directory, as they placed the cache in that local directory. As sources for up-to-date builds of windows binaries varied somehow over the years, it would be good to know, what mplayer tries to actually do. How to make fontconfig search for the fonts (cache) elsewhere? How exactly is mplayer searching for fonts? (Does it always rely on fonts.conf?) Is it possible to disable fontconfig from the command line? What would mplayer do then? Can I disable updating of the font cache even when fonts do change? (Ie. ""only use already known fonts forever"") Note: There used to be a single, built-in, default font in old times for mplayer. What happened to that? I've found an option in , relative to mplayer.exe, which I can use to solve 1. (I keep it up to date manually when a new build arrives and I often forgot to do so.

484646,Are Projective resolutions of commutative rings always commutative?,Suppose $X$ is a commutative $R$-algebra with $R$ a commutative ring. Is it the case that there will always be a Projective resolution of $X$ as an $R$-module that is a graded commutative DGA? Tate showed this for $R$-algebras of the form $R/I$ for $I$ an ideal of $R$. I am wondering if there is a standard counterexample or if this result is known/unknown. It seems like one of those facts that someone in commutative algebra might know off the top of their head.

488621,OpenGL ES 2.x: any way to reuse depth buffer for off-screen and on-screen rendering?,"I'm doing 2-pass rendering, where for the first pass I'm rendering to a texture and for the second pass I'm rendering to the screen. I'm rendering the same polygons in both passes, but I'm using different shaders. In particular, the second pass uses a shader that takes the texture generated by the first pass as a parameter. Currently my first pass has a framebuffer with a texture for the color attachment and a renderbuffer for the depth attachment (stenciling is disabled), while the second pass renders to the default framebuffer (0). It occurred to me that since I'm rendering exactly the same polygons in pass-2, the depth buffer will end up looking identical to my pass-1 depth buffer. If I could somehow have the pass-2 depth buffer start out initialized to pass-1's depth buffer, I could then change my depth test function to GL_LEQUAL and avoid a lot of unnecessary work for pass-2's fragment shader. Depth writes could also be disabled for this pass. So... is there some way to do one of the following? create my own framebuffer that uses the screen's depth buffer (but still writes colors to a texture) attach my own renderbuffer to the default framebuffer's depth attachment The only workaround I can think of (and I haven't tried this yet, so I have no idea what kind of effect this will have on performance) is to have the second pass also render to a texture, and then have a third pass that just ""blits"" the texture to the screen.",[],False

511577,Is Gödel's completeness theorem a representation theorem?,"In general a representation theorem is &mdash; according to Wikipedia &mdash; a ""theorem that states that every abstract structure with certain properties is isomorphic to a concrete structure"". Wikipedia gives a list of canonical examples. [Side remark: Interesting enough, the only genuinely set theoretical example (Mostowski's collapsing theorem) is filed under ""category theory"", and Dedekind's lemma which is fairly easy to grasp is missing in this list.] I'd like to ask: Can Gödel's completeness theorem be considered a representation theorem? I dare to ask because Consistent logical formulae (or sets of, ie. theories) can be considered as (descriptions of) abstract structures The (set theoretical) models of such formulae (resp. theories) are concrete structures. One important difference between Gödel's incompleteness theorem and some of the representation theorems listed at Wikipedia is, that not only in it's proofs (known to me) the concrete structures don't ""come free with"" the abstract structures &mdash; as most easily seen in the Dedekind case of posets &mdash; but that the proofs are non-constructive at all. So I'd like to flank my question: Is the Wikipedia ""definition"" of the notion of a representation theorem adequate or would practicing representation theorists refine it, e.g. to exclude ""non-constructive"" theorems.",[],False

679745,"Poll database every second, no page refresh; redirect page if database value has changed","I have set up series of pages whose display order depends on a changing variable from a common database. Each page posts a value to the database when loaded (ex: page A posts value 1), then begins to count down. When a user on a different machine clicks on another page, the value is updated (page B posts value 2). I would like to make it so that page A could read the change in value while it's still counting down and, without refreshing, could redirect itself to another page, let's say C. Since I already have a PHP script calling the database to update the value, I can't repeat that call without changing the value from what B posted (2) back to (1). I know I need use AJAX and setinterval(), and I've looked through many, many examples, but I can't seem to find a way to have page A retrieve the value and activate a redirect that doesn't include printing the value in some way (I'm not actually showing the value on the page) or constructing a div (as in HTML - Change\Update page contents without refreshing\reloading the page). My thinking is that I need to create an external PHP file to query the database and use AJAX to call it repeatedly and pass the updated value to a refresh function in some way.

1093232,Grouping data in WPF treeview,"I wanna create a WPF treeview with data with two grouping options (radio buttons). So the data will be grouped in two different ways (2 level hierarchy), the lowest level being the actual data items, and the groups being just a way to represent the data for easier understanding. They would also be able to select items by group (checkboxes) but I got that part already figured out. E.g. if I want to represent database objects and want to have them grouped either by schema or by object type (table, view, function,...). I just don't know how I should start on the two grouping modes. Should I entirely restructure my ObservableCollection whenever the grouping mode changes or is there a more straightforward way? Also, what if my DataTemplate for the 2-nd level would be slightly different depending on the grouping mode (e.g. if grouped by object type you need to display the schema on level 2)? Can anyone give me some tips on how to start and which techniques to use? Thanks",[],False

What I'd like to achieve is the following: setting up pages in a way that I can access different sections via the template (e.g. paragraph 1, table 1, paragraph 2) having a template which allows me to change the structure/order of the content of those pages (eg moving around the paragraphs on all of them by changing the template) The metadata section sounded good for that, but it does not allow any markup languages in there, right?

Boxes represent components, and arrows represent interactions without those components. Here are my questions: Does this model look OK? Can you see something that could be improved?

I have used the KineticJS library to draw the images and make them draggable, however, I'm using a local copy of the library, since there are one or two changes I wanted to make to its functionality. I now want to add some more functionality to the function in the library, but I'm not exactly sure of how to do what I want to, and I'm just wondering if anyone can point me in the right direction? I currently have about 30 images being displayed on the canvas- the images are all stored in a hidden section in the HTML, and have been added to a JS array from there. I also have another JS array, in a separate JS file, which contains an array of textual descriptions about each of the images in the image array.

What I'm not sure about is how to find out what position the image that's been clicked on is in the images array, so that I can store it in a variable, and then set the value to the value of that variable, to give me the same position in the tips array. I assume I'm going to need to edit the function in the library a little bit, to tell it to find out what array position the image that's been clicked on is at, but I'm not sure how to do this... any ideas?

1296265,Can anyone provide a rational explanation as to why a web server must assist in the creation of upload progress bars?,"I've been putting together a small personal website in rails and have gotten to the point where I need to be able to upload files. This is an almost trivial task and took no time at all. What is taking time - and is slowly sapping my sanity - is the task of providing the user with an upload progress bar. I've seen at least a dozen solutions now and they all seem to have one thing in common - they require the installation of a module on the web server. Given that I have no control over my server that and it seems unlikely that the hosting company will ever undertake to install any such animal, I'm in a bit of a bind. What makes this truly maddening is that involving the server in this process in any way, shape, or form, is absolutely unnecessary. Think about it: Your browser opens a socket to the remote server and starts sending data. Your browser knows exactly how many bytes are to be sent, and, thanks to the magic of TCP acknowledgments, is also aware of how many bytes have arrived at the server side. So why in the Name of The Flying Spaghetti Monster is there no simple way to present this data to Javascript without futzing around with the blasted server?",[],False

I'm wondering if it's normal for onCreateView to be called everytime I switch tabs, and does it make sense to do so? Shouldn't there be a way to NOT redraw the fragment every time the tab changes? I'm converting this from an app that had 3 activities, one in each tab, and it seems like a waste to recreate the view every time the tab changes, when it used to be just fine having the views exist between tab changes...

1387821,Is the fact that NSPathControl does not escape percent ('%') characters when bound to a string a bug?,"Steps: Environment: OS X 10.6.4 Xcode 3.2.1 Create a new ""Application"" project. Open the supplied application delegate. Add an property. In set the string property to . Open up the NIB. Drag an onto the application window.

You should see the following assertion and the path control will not display: If you remove the percent sign from the string in step 4 the assertion will go away and the path control will display properly. I have tried the following characters and none of them cause the same issue (make sure to escape double quote and backslash): After doing some debugging I tracked this down to this method supporting percent escapes. e.g. if you use the string the result will display ""Test string"" converting the %20 to a space character. I haven't found this behavior documented anywhere. Am I missing it? I encountered this issue because I was using to mirror the browser's path on an . If the contents of a selected browser cell contained a % sign the whole would fail (QA is great for turning up things like that—many thanks to them). My best guess is that it attempts to convert the string to an internally which fails returning nil which triggers the exception. This is reinforced by the fact that if you omit the leading / in your string you see the following message: But this is still missing something because is documented as adding the required precent escapes, and those methods which could be calling and are not documented as adding the escapes (e.g. ) are documented as requiring escapes for characters which cause no issues, namely , , , , and .

1397851,HttpWebRequest.Timeout Property behavior change between .NET 3.5 and 4.0?,"Has the HttpWebRequest.Timeout Property behavior changed between .NET 3.5 and 4.0? The documentation seems to imply so: From the .NET 3.5 MSDN doc: Timeout is the number of milliseconds that a subsequent synchronous request made with the GetResponse method waits for a response, and the GetRequestStream method waits for a stream. If the resource is not returned within the time-out period, the request throws a WebException with the Status property set to WebExceptionStatus.Timeout. The .NET 4.0 doc adds this sentence right in the middle: The Timeout applies to the entire request and response, not individually to the GetRequestStream and GetResponse method calls. This seems to be a rather large change. The ""entire request and response"" could mean the entire time spent sending the request and receiving the response. This seems to contradict the previous sentence, since waiting for the response stream to be ready might be quick -- basically just the time for the server to retrieve/prepare the response -- but receiving the entire response over the stream could take a long time.

The load went fine, so now I tried to save it, and I noticed that my save function is not being called.

1455296,PHP MySQL Zend-ACL - Graphically display ACL:,"I have one MySQL DB table like the following, the resources table: id | | 1 | | 2 | | 3 | | 4 | | 5 | | 6 | | Onto the next table, the rules table: id | | | | 1 | | | | 2 | | | | 3 | | | | 4 | | | | 5 | | | | 6 | | | | 7 | | | | OK, sorry for the length, but I am trying to give a full picture of what I am trying to do. So the way it works, a role (aka user) can be granted (rule: 1) access to a controller, a role can inherit (rule: 3) access from another role or a role and be denied (rule: 2) access to a controller. (A user is a resource and a controller is a resource) Access to actions are granted / denied using the extras column. This all works, its not a problem with setting up the ACL within zend. What I am now trying to do is show the relationships; to do that I need to find the lowest level a role is granted access to a controller stopping if it has explicitly been removed. I plan on listing the roles. When I click a role, I want it to show all the controllers that role has access to. Then clicking on a controller shows the actions the role is allowed to do. So in the example above, a guest is allowed to view the index action of the index controller along with the login action. A member inherits the same access, but is then denied access to the login action and register action. A moderator inherits the rules of a member. So if I were to select the role moderator. I want to see the controller index listed. If I click on the controller, it should show the allowed actions as being action: index. (which was originally granted to the guest, but hasn't since been dissallowed) Is there any examples to doing this. I am obviously working with the Zend MVC (PHP) and MySQL. Even just a persudo code example would be a helpful starting point - this is one of the last parts of the jigsaw I am putting together. P.S. Obviously I have the ACL object - is it going to be easier to interigate that or is it better to do it my self via PHP/MySQL? The aim will be, show what a role can access which will then allow me to add or edit a role, controller and action in a GUI style (that is somewhat the easy bit) - currently I am updating the DB manually as I have been building the site.","['name', 'type', 'guest', 'user', 'member', 'user', 'moderator', 'user', 'owner', 'user', 'admin', 'user', 'index', 'controller', 'user_id', 'rule', 'resource_id', 'extras', '2', '3', '1', 'null', '3', '3', '2', 'null', '4', '3', '3', 'null', '5', '3', '4', 'null', '6', '1', '1', 'index,login,register', '6', '2', '2', 'login,register', '6', '1', '2', 'logout']",False

1460602,Like Box Activity Stream Quirks when Logged in,"I've just started working with the social plug-ins and I've hit a problem. My client uses the Facebook wall of her business page as a news feed and so I have used the ""Like Box"" plug-in to publish this feed to her website. If a user is LOGGED OUT of Facebook then the activity feed displays as expected, and all is good. If a user is LOGGED IN to Facebook, but has no connection to her or the company (i.e. not friends with her, the business, or related parties) then all is good The problems start when a user is LOGGED IN to Facebook and has some connection. At this point the activity stream is replaced by another stream which shows your friend's activity in relation to the business's page (in my case, a single entry). For me this behavior is undesirable and breaks the functionality of the news stream. Is there any way to disable it and have the plug-in display the wall no matter what? If not, is there another way of achieving this functionality through the API? Thanks, Olly Lennox",[],False

1494514,Designing a PHP API wrapper,"I was wondering what is a good method to implement two similair API's into one PHP framework? My thought was something like this: /vendors/wrapperA.php - extends Parent, implements API (A) /vendors/wrapperB.php - extends Parent, implements API (B) Parent.php - the only script referenced directly to use the API wrapper $config[] array for configuration in Parent.php index.php - A website that implements and only references Parent.php Let's say the API's have many methods, but we only implement two simple API calls: connect() - creates a connection to the service. put() - returns a ""putID"" if successful. Since API (A) and API (B) differ, this is how the wrapper implements its utility, by abstracting these two methods. Now, to my point: What would be a good way to implement this in PHP? the connect() statement would need to validate there is a valid connection. the put() statement would need to return an ID we don't want to expose the differences in the put methods, it just needs to work based on if we configured our API authentication correctly (whatever the case may be - via secret key or otherwise) i.e. Something like Currently, I have all of my code in Parent.php.

How do I update the property of the via JavaScript in such a way that I can read the property in the codebehind? UPDATE: This is a small problem on a large form that contains 41 labels, each of which displays the results of some calculation for the user. Taking the advice of FishBasketGordo I converted my to a disabled . I'm setting the value of the new textbox as such: Again, in the codebehind, the value of is always equal to """". I don't mind changing how I approach this, but here's the crux of the matter. I am using javascript to manipulate the property values of some controls. I need to be able to access these manipulated values from the code behind when 'Submit' is clicked. Any advice how I can go about this? UPDATE 2: Regarding the answer by @James Johnson, I am not able to retrieve the value using .innerText property as suggested. I have set to true on the . Is there something else I am missing? I don't understand why, when I type in a textbox and submit the form, I can access the value in the codebehind, but when I programatically change the text of a textbox or label by way of javascrpit, I cannot access the new value.","['&lt;asp:Label&gt;', ""document.getElementById('&lt;%=TotalLoans.ClientID %&gt;').innerHTML = TotalLoans;\n"", 'Text', 'innerHTML', '//TotalLoans.Text will always be equal to """" in this scenario\ndouble bTotalLoans = string.IsNullOrEmpty(TotalLoans.Text) \n                   ? 0.00 \n                   : Convert.ToDouble(TotalLoans.Text);\n', 'Text', '&lt;asp:Label&gt;', '&lt;asp:Label&gt;', '&lt;asp:TextBox&gt;', ""    document.getElementById('&lt;%=TotalLoans.ClientID %&gt;').value = TotalLoans;\n"", 'TotalLoans.Text', 'EnableViewState', '&lt;asp:Label&gt;']",False

1540418,Taking Database Settings out of the application.ini and into the environment,"In traditional coding of Zend based applications, the database settings are stored in the application.ini . This stores the settings on a per application basis. Has anyone here on StackOverflow explored the possibility of moving database settings from the application.ini into the environment? For example, a basic way would be storing possibly database connections settings in the Apache2 envvars file or possibly in something like /etc/profile or /etc/environment . There are a couple of reasons why I would like to do this: 1) There is security risk where having live, production database settings within the application. Developers could inadvertedly connect to the live database and cause damage to customer sensitive data. This would protect both developers, the business an end users. 2) It is difficult to maintain and manage the db settings of multiple applications. For example, if a username or password changes for a database, then we would need to change the application.ini or multiple applications that would mean a rollout of just that file or the whole application again. 3) An application may be deployed to mulitple 'production' environments where the database settings differ. Therefore there may have to be multiple sections within the application.ini - for example and production-datacentreX, production-datacentreY. As you can see, there is an argument on keeping database settings on the server side. Therefore, it may be better to have possibly the database settings outside an application in a global area for all applications to access? This would be in it's own source control perhaps that would be unaccessible to developers. What do you folks think? Anyone done something similar? I like the idea of a global application.ini (possibly called database.ini?) Looking forward to hearing some responses on the subject. Regards, Steve",[],False

1697911,RelativeLayout: align view to child of sibling viewgroup,"I'm trying to make a tab bar in android using a RelativeLayout and a RadioGroup that has an indicator which will slide to indicate the active RadioButton within the RadioGroup. These are customized radio buttons that are effectively rectangles with an icon over text, all contents centered, which uses a custom state-selector for the background. Here's my current hierarchy: The idea I had was when a radio button was clicked, I would align the indicator to the top &amp; bottom of the selected radio button (and animate it). However, It seems that only works with sibling elements, not with members of another view group, i.e. I can align to the RadioGroup itself, but not to a RadioButton inside it. I thought of putting the indicator as a member of the RadioGroup, but since RadioGroup is an extension of LinearLayout, there doesn't seem to be a way to place it at the edge of a given RadioButton. Can anyone think of how I might solve this issue? Or perhaps there's a better solution than my animate-align-to-button technique? UPDATE With @superjos help, I managed to work this out fairly well. I had to give each button a known height instead of using (not ideal, but for this project it should probably work fine). Make the indicator height match that of the buttons. Make sure the RadioGroup is set to wrap content and be centered vertically in the parent view. Set indicator to and the RadioGroup.

What I need is a cell with a caption on the left side, the value on the right side and also a accessory item on the right side. I didn't find anything like that.

I'm using MVC 3 and have a telerik upload control in my view which has client side event like onUpload, onSuccess etc., So, what I want to achieve is when I click on the upload control, I have to make a DB call and get the count. 0 then I have to display a warning message (basically a custom icon) and Yes-No buttons. If count = 0 then File upload dialog needs to be displayed. I am achieving the purpose by using javascript confirm box but I need to use a custom warning icon &amp; Yes-No buttons. I tried using jquery dialog box (with yes &amp; no buttons) but when Yes button is clicked no upload file dialog is opened. I understand .dialog('open') is asynchronous and hence doesn't wait on user input. I wrote a callback function but was not able to invoke the telerik upload control explicity either.

I can say for sure that I've done nothing special to the visual studio project. It prompts you with the option to enable web debugging (which I said yes to), but that's about it.

1916179,WEKA attribute removal using regular expressions,I am new to machine learning and I have a task to predict protein and for that i have a big data file in *.arff format. I have to use the SVM algorithm to train. My question is : I need an example JAVA code where we remove attributes from the dataset. I have alot of different attributes (around 3000 in the header) and i want to use only around 800 and i want to remove the remaining attributes from the header and the data section. I tried using the REMOVEBYNAME method but somehow it is not available in the java weka sdk(i guess it is not the part of stable release). Can you please suggest me an example/tutorial which i can follow to 1- Remove extra features 2- Train my dataset using SVM 3- Test my results Note: I tried to remove the extra attributes from the GUI of weka using a regular expression. I just want to use the same function in the JAVA code that takes regular expressions as input and outputs the clean dataset. Ideas ?,[],False

2348000,"How can I coordinate various DLLs in the same process, without help from the host program?","I am looking for a way to coordinate DLLs in the same process, in order to provide a data sharing mechanism between them. The goal is to have the same sharing code for all DLLs, and to have them coordinate in such a way that the first one loaded by the main program will act as the manager for shared items, while the others will use this manager. I cannot modify the main application, so having that set up the manager and sharing its memory address with the other DLLs is not possible. The set of DLLs using this mechanism can vary, so I cannot assume explicitly that one of them will be loaded. One solution I considered is to add the memory address to the environment variables of the process. The first DLL would see that the environment variable is not set yet, create the manager object and set the variable to its address. The other DLLs would see the variable and create a pointer to the manager object from that. This comes close to what I want, but it seems a bit crude, since there is no guarantee that the environment variable isn't set already for some reason, and SetEnvironmentVariable/GetEnvironmentVariable can fail for various reasons. Is there a better way to handle this? I'm looking for a way to store and retreive a named pointer in the context of a process, but if you have a better solution for the underlying problem of getting the DLLs to cooperate I'd be happy to accept this as well.",[],False

2385236,G-WAN persist request data in handler,"Solution: int session = (int)get_env(argv, SESSION_ID); to get identifier unique to connection (vhost) or (listener) or current connection Missing pieces: either persistent data for connection only or some way to execute code when current connection is closed by client (econnreset etc.) or server (e.g. kalive_tmo reached) This should be solvable as soon as a new HDL_BEFORE_CLOSE state for handlers is added, which makes this question answered for me. Original Question: Is it possible in a G-WAN handler to store information persistent to a request/connection (don't really know if ""request"" applies here)? To better illustrate what I mean, this is what I got now: Client (browser, javascript) sends websocket handshake Handler starts, gets into: HDL_AFTER_ACCEPT - here i call gc_init for US_REQUEST_DATA, and get no error HDL_AFTER_READ - here i check for US_REQUEST_DATA which is not yet set, so I do websocket handshake and gc_malloc + set US_REQUEST_DATA, increase KALIVE_TMO, and then return 2 to send data Client sees websocket connection as being established, so I (manually triggered some seconds afterwards) send a message Handler goes to HDL_AFTER_READ again, BUT US_REQUEST_DATA is not set client gets 404 and handshake does not work At the moment I'm only using US_REQUEST_DATA to identify if websocket connection is already established and next incoming data should be in websocket message format, so if there is a different (maybe better?) solution, I'm open to that as well of course.

Note that I am not assuming that the pattern to be matched is fully contained within one line of input (i.e. multi-line patterns are permitted). Nor am I assuming a maximum match length. It is true that, at this level of generality, it is possible to specify a regex that would require that the regex engine have access to the entire string (e.g. ), and, of course, this means having to read the entire file into memory, but I am not concerned with this worst-case scenario at the moment. It is, after all, perfectly possible to write multi-line-matching regular expressions that would not require reading the entire file into memory. Is it possible to access the underlying automaton (or whatever is used internally) from a compiled regex, to feed it a stream of characters? Thanks!

2565467,embed navigation bar into iframe,"I am thinking to embed a navigation bar into an iframe. The environment is a growing intranet site that needs consistent look &amp; feel. Usually I would put the navigation into the layout-template code, but this is more difficult as it sounds. The layout-template is layered, you have an overall template and then an application-/site-specific template. So this solutions feels messy. The actual reason why it's a problem is this: the navigation is different for different users because of rights management. Problem #2: one could use an AJAX solution but this is also not cool because I have the requirement to keep Javascript usage as low and simple as possible. So, question: iframe yes or no?

2596433,C++ - std::list remove_if doesn't deallocate memory?,"Possible Duplicate: Does std::list::remove method call destructor of each removed element? I have a Parent class and subclassed the two children Foo and Bar. Class declarations look something like this: class Parent { public: virtual void action()=0; std::string getName() {return name;} Parent(std::string name): name(name) {} virtual ~Parent() {} private: std::string name; } class Foo { public: virtual void action(); //Declared somewhere else. Foo(int a, int b, unsigned long c, std::string name): Parent(name),a(a),b(b),c(c) {} virtual ~Foo() {} private: int a,b; unsigned long c; } Bar looks pretty much the same as Foo. I don't think the differences in their action functions and their private members will make much of a difference (it's also a bunch of ints). I need to make a list of Parents filled with Foos and Bars. I do this to add them in and subsequently remove them: std::list&lt;Parent *&gt; pList; pList.push_back(new Foo(1,2,3,""Thing"")); removeFromList(&amp;pList, ""Thing""); Where removeFromList is defined as follows: // Binary predicate struct, find objects with matching name. struct NameMatch : public std::binary_function&lt; Parent*, std::string, bool &gt; { bool operator () (Parent* p, const std::string name) const { return (p-&gt;getName()==name); } }; /* Removes a named object from the list of Foos. Does nothing if a matching name can't be found. */ void removeFromList(std::list&lt;Parent *&gt; *pList, std::string name) { pList-&gt;remove_if(std::bind2nd(NameMatch(),name)); } However, once I exit the program after, Valgrind will report there are memory leaks, where the lines referenced by main.cpp are the push_back operations done on the list: Does this mean that the list's remove_if function doesn't deallocate memory, or is there an error I made somewhere else? And how would I make sure that my program won't leak memory from using these classes? A second set of eyes would be really helpful. Thanks in advance!

I turned on the computer and there was no wireless connection. After resetting the USB cable that connected the Wireless G USB Adapter (old linksys that still had the light blue on the box) to the computer the connection came back but only for a moment. I ran the windows connection diagnostics wizard from IE and it was able to find the connection. The connection held for about an hour and during that hour I updated Malwarebytes and ran a scan, it was clean. The virus scanner also turned up clean. After this was done Windows lost the connection. After a Windows reboot the connection was found immediately and it held the remainder of the time I was there. Given that this has been an issue for the client for some time I suggested purchasing a PCI wireless adapter. I'm under the assumption that there is a problem with the (old) wireless USB adapter or possibly even the cable it is attached to. Possibly not enough power?

2849261,Is there a workaround to the loss of the state drawables when passing a TextView to the setIndicator method of a TabSpec?,"I am implementing a Tabbed Layout in an application where vertical screen real estate is of the utmost importance, and so I have resized the height of the tabs in the XML layout. The tabs do not have an icon drawable resource, they have basic text labels. I am using the method when setting the TabSpec programatically, but it would seem that even when using this method the Android OS reserves the top of the tab for an icon and it also seems to resize the tabs from the bottom up. As a result my tabs are so short that the text label on the tab is not visible. From what I've gathered through my Googling and also from other Stack Overflow questions, the best way to address this issue is to use a TextView instead of a CharSequence for the Indicator. So, I have tried programatically declaring a new TextView, and then passing it in to the setIndicator method. The text label is now visible, but, the tab has absolutely no visual styling/state drawables what so ever. Further, if that tab is active, the text itself is no longer visible due to the lack of state drawables. This is obviously also a problem. I would like to post the code I am using, but the nature of the project prevents me from sharing any source. I can however say the following: In programatically creating the TextView, I have tried doing as little work as simply setting the text, through to as much as using the and and many other properties. I have tried using completely transparent values for the backgroundColor. No avail. I have not tried creating the TextView as an XML resource and bringing using it in that fashion, though I don't see how that would change the outcome. And so my question is the following: Is there any way to achieve short tabs that have only a text label without having to go through the process of extending classes or creating sets of state drawable resources? While these are mostly simple tasks, the nature of this app is that it is on an extremely short turn-around time and presentation/user chrome is of the utmost non-importance; currently functionality is priority number one and if I can save time by using the provided UI elements then that is the route I would prefer to take since I don't really have the ability to download a bunch of graphic editing software on my workstation without headaches and I'm also the only one working on the project, further, the only one here who is permitted to work on the project. My apologies for the nebulousness of this whole affair. Thanks in advance.","['setIndicator(CharSequence)', 'LayoutParams(int, int)', 'setBackgroundColor']",False
2851178,WPF DataGrid with textbox in template column not firing property changed,"I have a datagrid with a template column, and in that template is a textbox. It's bound to the 'Quantity' property of the object in the collection that makes up itemssource. Quantity is an integer. When I add an item to the datagrid, I am adding an event handler to the PropertyChanged event of the item: This works fine when the user enters an integer in the textbox... the p_PropertyChanged handler fires and I can disable buttons and alter quantities as necessary. When the user enters a non-integer, the handler doesn't get called, I just get a red outline around the textbox. Because of this, I can't disable the necessary buttons when I need to (they should be disabled with the quantity is not legit.) Is there any way that I can do something about this? EDIT: I tried changing the Quantity property to a string, and this caused the property changed handler to be called when non-integral values are entered. However, I then added validation to the textbox to check for this, and if the Validate method returns false, the property changed handler once again ceases to be hit. Is there any way at all to get both validation and property changed notifications?? EDIT 2: Here another instance of this problem I'm having, in another location. I have a form for adding/editing phone numbers. The phone number textbox looks like this: Upon clicking a save button, I need to check in my viewmodel if the number is valid, because if it's not, I don't want to run the save command. However, it doesn't seem as if there's any way to do that, because if the validation fails, then the Phone.Number property has a null value, and I have no way to check to see if I should run the save command.

2862833,Create caption without float AND without caption-package?,"In the appendix of my thesis, there is a large number of tables and longtables which does not need to float, as they shall appear one after the other just how they fit on the pages (and it is no problem if the bottom third of a page would stay empty). (The appendix is structured by some headings and sometimes there is also a short paragraph or two to explain something about the data shown in the tables. So I explicitely do want to appear the tables directly and not float ""elsewhere"" - apart from the explaining text.) So I thought it would be easier to let typeset the tables (tabular) directly, which works well as long as I don't need captions. But I found that I can not use the -command in those tabulars.

2925134,How do I accept a self-signed certificate with a Java HttpsURLConnection?,"A module I'm adding to our large Java application has to converse with another company's SSL-secured website. The problem is that the site uses a self-signed certificate. I have a copy of the certificate to verify that I'm not encountering a man-in-the-middle attack, and I need to incorporate this certificate into our code in such a way that the connection to the server will be successful. Here's the basic code: Without any additional handling in place for the self-signed certificate, this dies at conn.getOutputStream() with the following exception: Ideally, my code needs to teach Java to accept this one self-signed certificate, for this one spot in the application, and nowhere else. I know that I can import the certificate into the JRE's certificate authority store, and that will allow Java to accept it. That's not an approach I want to take if I can help; it seems very invasive to do on all of our customer's machines for one module they may not use; it would affect all other Java applications using the same JRE, and I don't like that even though the odds of any other Java application ever accessing this site are nil. It's also not a trivial operation: on UNIX I have to obtain access rights to modify the JRE in this way. I've also seen that I can create a TrustManager instance that does some custom checking. It looks like I might even be able to create a TrustManager that delegates to the real TrustManager in all instances except this one certificate. But it looks like that TrustManager gets installed globally, and I presume would affect all other connections from our application, and that doesn't smell quite right to me, either. What is the preferred, standard, or best way to set up a Java application to accept a self-signed certificate?

Elmah is great at logging request bodies if the request is a Form-based request (i.e. Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded), but with JSON based requests where the content type is application/json, the request body is nowhere to be found in the error reports.

How do I reset the keyboard programmatically in this method? This may be a repeat question for this question. But the answer doesn't seem to work for me. This is the accepted answer: And this is the last comment: OK, apparently declaring it as a UITextView instead of a UIResponder affects how it behaves during runtime.

Next step was to run updates, no luck. So we thought it could be hardware related, and tried a different (known good) tape drive, but no luck there either. And then we tried everything else we could think of, like rebooting server, changing back to original tape drive and so on. What are we missing here? Oh and in both cases, software/hardware compression, the compression ratio field is blank. It never says 1:1 or anything, it's just blank.

One is that the app seems to need to be a canvas app in order to show up in the user's list of apps. The notification appears, but the app does not. The second problem is that if it is a canvas app, facebook posts to the canvas URL which requires me to create a special page to handle this. The biggest problem I have found so far is that I will have to maintain the request ids and their mapping back to the requesting user. I also have the requirement to do this sort of thing via twitter, etc. and I need to do this in a social media-agnostic way. Similarly, the send dialog sort of does what I want, but it doesn't have the same mechanism to choose the friends to whom he wishes to send the link.

3255397,Techniques for finding repeat transactions between customers with misspellings or other change in information?,"This isn't a SQL Server specific question; but there might be tSQL specific options here. I've got a bunch of customer details; many of them cancel and resign up for their service. They get an entirely new account; and our datavalidation is sketchy at best; so they often mistype email addresses or other data. The question is in two parts: First; I've got info such as first and last name, email, last 4 of credit card, postal code, phone number. Is there an algorithm/process I can look at my dataset with and look for common pools of repetition so I can determine some manual characteristics of the data that tend to be 'gotcha' items for repeat customers -- i.e. 80% of the time the emails were 'similar' and the zip code was the same, it was a repeat customer (based upon my human matching skills)? Second; How might I go about expressing similarity between sets of data --- i.e. have an item called a match if 3 of the 5 fields match? Some sort of similiarity index between all the different data points? I know I can use soundex to some extent on the names... not so sure on email addresses. So, I'm interested in both quick and dirty solutions (I'm whipping together an analysis tonight; but I'm also very interested in the 'right' ways of going to tackle this problem.)

3319806,Hibernate 2nd level cache ObjectNotFoundException with a high number of concurrent transactions,"We have a Java application that uses MySQL, Hibernate (3.5.1-Final) and EHcache(1.2.3) for our 2nd level cache. Our hibernate.properties isolation level is Read-committed isolation = 2 Under a high number of concurrent transactions, we're seeing an issue where certain collections (DB associations) when loaded will throw an ObjectNotFoundException and it appears that the 2nd level cache is returning an old copy of that collection. We have many different types of transactions that access this collection (only reading) and only a couple that will add/delete items from it. We don't see this issue under single transaction load or even moderate transaction load (10 - 20 concurrent connections). For example we have a Character entity: We are properly maintaining the object graph when deleting entities by removing them from the collection that they're contained in and calling session.delete(). We've tried changing the Set items; CacheConcurrencyStrategy from: To With no luck. We don't use database locks instead we use optimistic concurrency control to catch and retry conflicting transactions. The only 2 solutions we can see at this point is to: Try to catch the ObjectNotFoundException and try to intelligently evict the collection (although there doesn't seem to be enough context in the exception) Use the @NotFound(action=NotFoundAction.IGNORE) annotation on the items collection, which will ignore and not throw the ObjectNotFoundException (but we have concerns as to how this works with the 2nd level cache and ensure that it's looking at the proper data). I wish there was a @NotFound(action=NotFoundAction.EVICT_2ND_LEVEL_CACHE_RELOAD) where it would evict that object from the cache and attempt to reload the collection.

I have worked in a few IT departments and every place I go I seem to see the same thing, users are looking for a way to bring there old access databases for things like IT inventory and task management onto the web. SharePoint is the obvious choice, but it seems it can get about 90% of the way there out of the box. Then all of a sudden you hit a dead end and your only option is to bust out visual studio to complete the rest, obviously not great when the end user has done the first 90% themselves ! The real restrictions seem to be on linking lists, permissions on individual list columns etc I see SharePoint 2013 and Access 2013 can now be linked/integrated, has anybody tried this sort of stuff and is it really doable for an end user like Microsoft say ?",[],False

3474888,Encrypting Windows Phone Resources at the Bit Level... am I doing this right?,"I have a question concerning encryption, more specifically encryption that requires no internet connection (opposed to private / public key or OAuth methods). The problem arose when I discovered that the WP7 app store is not secure. I won't post a link, but a basic search will yield a desktop application that allows you to download any free WP7 in the marketplace. Then it's a matter of renaming .xap to .zip, and using reflector to look at the code. I believe that Dotfuscator will solve my problem, but as a learning experience I decided to come up with my own solution. I decided to have a program that in prebuild gathers the files I want to encrypt, puts them in one file, encrypts that file, and adds it to the project for compilation. Code in the phone app only needs to decrypt the data. The data I'm encrypting / decrypting is several API Keys (for ~10 web services), meant to be readable as plain text when decrypted. This is the encryption algorithm (roughly, and with a few alterations) that I came up with: I may be shooting myself in the foot posting this, but if it's not known that the data is encrypted using this method, brute force breaking of this takes n! time, where n is the total number of bits in the file. (basically, much, much higher than the probability of randomly guessing a GUID). Assuming the GUID is well hidden within the file, a brute force attack would take a very long time to figure out. I spent a lot of time learning about encryption on my way to this solution, and everything I read seemed to be WAY more complicated than this (and, obviously all the things I read dealt with two parties, where encryption can involve a key being passed between them). What I learned is this: If the key to encrypting the data is stored with the data, it's only a matter of time for someone to crack it, and get the data There is no such thing as ""perfectly secure"". There are varying degrees of success in encryption, and generally speaking, when picking a method of encryption you will want to weigh the importance of the data being secure with the ease with which (considering processor and memory limitations) the data can be decrypted by your program. I'm thinking that this is too simple to be a good solution. Can anyone prove that suspicion, and explain to me why this isn't as secure as some other methods of encryption?

In that example Hartshorne states that $\mathcal{O}(-1)$ has no global sections. However, we know that $\mathcal{O}(1)$ is generated by global sections. This is stated at the first of the section that if $\mathbb{P}_k^n = Proj k[x_0,...,x_n]$ then the $x_0,...,x_n$ give rise to global sections $x_0,...,x_n\in\Gamma(\mathbb{P}_k^n,\mathcal{O}(1))$. I guess I don't understand this twisted structure sheaf very well, or to be honest I don't think I understand structure sheaves in general as well as I would like. The twisting part seems simple at first- you shift the grading of Proj over and then take the structure sheaf.

4053047,How to change page margins but keep the placement of the pagemark?,"I use the package to adjust the page margins for my needs. However, the first page should be different. To accomplish this, I used , which works fine, except that the distance between page number and margins is also changed (of course). How can I adjust the margins on the first page differently from the rest, but have the exact same placement of the page number (so the page mark on page 1 should be placed like the one on page 3)? Note that the solution suggested by A.Ellett works for this example. However, I have more things in the footer than just the pagenumber. Here is an example (which I should have provided in the first place). My goal in this example was to move the page number in the margins, but have the rest of the footer aligned with the text. I would like to keep this exactly as on the other pages (page 3), but just change the margins for the rest of the content on the first page. Okay, I realized I should have put a not-so-minimal example up in the first place. Here it is: If you use the -- approach, you see how the content of the first page should appear. However, as you can see, the margin for the footer is not identical to the one on, say, page 3. Now, if you use the approach (as given here), you see that the whole page setup seems to get messed up. Also, a new page appears, so the ""title page"" is not the first one anymore.","['geometry', '\\newgeometry', '\\restoregeometry', '\\documentclass[paper=8.5in:11in,twoside]{scrartcl}\n\n\\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}\n\\usepackage{lmodern}\n\\usepackage[american]{babel}\n\\usepackage[nouppercase]{scrpage2}\n\\usepackage[bottom=1.1in, left=2in, top=0.6in, right=0.9in]{geometry}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\\newgeometry{bottom=1.1in, left=0.8in, top=0.6in, right=0.6in}% change default geometry settings\nDummy text\\dots\n\\restoregeometry% restore geometry settings\n\\clearpage\nMore dummy text\\dots\n\\clearpage\nMore dummy text\\dots\n\\end{document}\n', '\\documentclass[paper=8.5in:11in,twoside]{scrartcl}\n\n\\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}\n\\usepackage{lmodern}\n\\usepackage[american]{babel}\n\\usepackage[nouppercase]{scrpage2}\n\\usepackage[bottom=1.1in, left=2in, top=0.6in, right=0.9in]{geometry}\n\n\\pagestyle{scrheadings}% activates pagestyle from scrpage2\n\\rofoot{\\texttt{tex.stackexchange.com}\\ \\ \\textbullet\\ \\ This is just an\n  example\\xpageno{o}}\n% the following definition is from http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/84404/page-number-in-outer-margin-affects-vertical-ruler\n\\def\\xpageno#1{\\leavevmode\n  \\vbox to 0pt{\n    \\vss\n    \\hbox to 0pt{%\n      \\if#1o\\kern 2em\\else\\hss\\fi\\thepage\n      \\if#1o\\hss\\else\\kern2em\\fi}}}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\\newgeometry{bottom=1.1in, left=0.8in, top=0.6in, right=0.6in}% change default geometry settings\nDummy text\\dots\n\\restoregeometry% restore geometry settings\n\\clearpage\nMore dummy text\\dots\n\\clearpage\nMore dummy text\\dots\n\\end{document}\n', '\\documentclass[paper=8.5in:11in,twoside]{scrartcl}\n\n\\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}\n\\usepackage{lmodern}\n\\usepackage[american]{babel}\n\\usepackage{blindtext}\n\\usepackage[nouppercase]{scrpage2}\n\\usepackage[bottom=1.1in, left=2in, top=0.6in, right=0.9in]{geometry}\n\n\\pagestyle{scrheadings}% activates pagestyle from scrpage2\n\\rofoot{\\texttt{tex.stackexchange.com}\\ \\ \\textbullet\\ \\ This is just an\n  example\\xpageno{o}}% right odd\n\\lefoot{\\xpageno{e}Just another text}% left even\n% the following definition is from http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/84404/page-number-in-outer-margin-affects-vertical-ruler\n\\def\\xpageno#1{\\leavevmode\n  \\vbox to 0pt{\n    \\vss\n    \\hbox to 0pt{%\n      \\if#1o\\kern 2em\\else\\hss\\fi\\thepage\n      \\if#1o\\hss\\else\\kern2em\\fi}}}\n\\usepackage{changepage}\n\n\\begin{document}\n% create ""title page"" but with same footer as other pages\n%\\newgeometry{bottom=1.1in, left=0.8in, top=0.6in, right=0.6in}% change default geometry settings\n\\begin{adjustwidth}{0in}{-1in}\n  % content of the ""title page""\n  \\vspace*{74pt}\n  \\noindent\n  \\begin{minipage}[t]{0.3\\textwidth}\n    \\vspace{-\\baselineskip}\n    \\framebox[\\textwidth]{\\rule{0pt}{\\textwidth}Logo}%\n  \\end{minipage}\n  \\hfill\n  \\begin{minipage}[t]{0.618034\\textwidth}\n    \\vspace{-\\baselineskip}\n    {\\bfseries\\LARGE This is just a title to see what\'s it all about\\par}\n    \\bigskip\\bigskip\n    {\\large\\bfseries M.\\ Mustermann\\par}\n    \\medskip\n    {\\footnotesize Fool\'s Street 42\\par}\n    \\bigskip\\smallskip\n    {\\large\\bfseries M.\\ Musterfrau\\par}\n    \\medskip\n    {\\footnotesize Fool\'s University, Fool\'s City\\par}\n  \\end{minipage}\n  % left/right content\n  \\par\\vspace*{248pt}\n  \\begin{minipage}[t]{0.3\\textwidth}\n    \\vspace{-\\baselineskip}\n    \\footnotesize\\noindent\n    \\blindtext[1]\n  \\end{minipage}\n  \\hfill\n  \\begin{minipage}[t]{0.618034\\textwidth}\n    \\vspace{-\\baselineskip}\n    \\noindent{\\bfseries Keywords\\par}\n    {\\footnotesize\\medskip\n      Fool\'s Garden, Fool\'s proof.\n      \\par\\bigskip}\n    \\noindent{\\bfseries Abstract\\par}\n    {\\footnotesize\\medskip\\blindtext[1]}\n  \\end{minipage}\n\\end{adjustwidth}\n%\\restoregeometry% restore geometry settings\n\\clearpage\n% first page\n\\blindtext[6]\n\\clearpage\n% second page\n\\blindtext[6]\n\\end{document}\n', '\\newgeometry', '\\restoregeometry', 'changepage']",False

4104803,Diagnosing DDOS after the fact,"I manage the code and deployments for an ASP.net site on a dedicated server. Windows 2008-64 R2, 8GB RAM, Dual Core. It is a dedicated intranet site that never has much traffic. Most of the performance issues that we run into are memory issues on the server (the app sometimes has to import and interpret data from 1GB+ Excel files, or process large amounts of data for insertion into the DB) or in the DB (from the aforementioned inserts, sometimes coupled with table locking due to data being updated concurrent with insertions to the same table). A few days ago, there was a six hour period of time where the Processor monitors on the site were over 95% for the entire period. Website responsiveness was sluggish, and at times it was impossible to access the site at all. I got twice-per-minute emails from our monitoring service about the sustained processor over-utilization, but aside from a couple of alarms that did not repeat, there were no issues with running out of memory. And from the user perspective, reports came in indicating that upload bandwidth was much slower than normal. I checked windows logs - nothing out of the ordinary. Checked my internal logs on the site for any in-site activity that might account for this, and also nothing to explain the poor behavior (or even something that might have explained running short on memory). So I am still left looking for a cause to this server event (it cleared up on its own, very suddenly). The only other explanation that I can think of is a DDOS attack. The entire site is password protected, but I would think that if enough connections were being made to the homepage during this time, that it would result in the symptoms that I know about: sustained high processor utilization (without any hit on memory, since the login page is not dynamic) and decreased bandwidth in both directions. Is there any way that I can try to verify if this may or may not have been the cause? Any default logs in windows server or IIS that would record information like this? Is there any other cause that you can think of that would lead to the symptoms that I described?",[],False

4155513,Android Database Access Design Approach,"I have a general Android design question around data access. I have a number of activities in my application that need to access a SQLite database. In order to wrap up all data access logic in one place I have created a DatbaseHandler class that takes care of all data access logic. This class takes care of building up where clauses, calling the database and interrogating the resulting cursor to retrieve the query results and return them to the caller. The purpose of this class is to wrap all data access code in one place so that it can be easily managed and maintained as opposed to having data access logic scattered across all activities. Each activity that needs access to the database creates an instance of this DatabaseHandler class and passes it a reference of android.content.Context. The DatabaseHandler class then uses this Context object to call an underlying content provider as follows context_i.getContentResolver().query(...). My data access logic (cursor handling logic to be specific) is not in the activity and so I cannot manage the cursors life cycle, therefore there is likely to be memory leaks. My questions are as follows - How can I (if its even possible) manage the cursors life cycle from outside an Activity? Should each activity even be creating an instance of this data handler class and passing an instance of Context to it? Perhaps my design approach is wrong and I should expose these data access functions as static methods that take an instance of the calling activity as a parameter. That way I could perform managed queries and let the activity take care of managing the cursors life cycle? I'd really like to get an understanding of the best approach. Any advice would be greatly appreciated",[],False

I've also tried this command in the form of a shell script, thinking perhaps the issue was that my rsync client was attempting to reuse an expired ssh connection. To that end, it fails seemingly at random whether using rsh or ssh. It periodically fails whether or not I do or , or not, or not. I cannot get the command to fail from the command line, but when it runs every minute, it fails 5–15 times an hour, depending on the directory being rsync'ed.

An example of the series of updates made on an action and subactions would be: startGame, 20110417; startGameZork, 20110417; startGameZorkWindows, 20110417 The problem seems to be that with this code running on the server, mongo commands in the shell get queued up. Currently I'm unsure as to why, I guess there may be a performance issue with so many updates per second. What I am wondering is how can I increase performance? I'm pretty new to mongo, so not entirely sure what options are available. I looked at PHP's batchInsert but I can't see any mention of doing batchUpdate (so instead of updating, creating an array holding all the data I currently update then doing a batchUpdate in a single trip to the DB).

4189960,Janrain's PHP-OpenID and Google/Yahoo,"I'm using Janrain's PHP-OpenID 2.1.3, and I've managed to get it working with all the providers I have tried except for Google and Yahoo. The major difference here seems to be that Google and Yahoo, unlike most other providers, don't use a user-specific URL, but rather have the user discovery framework all on their end - which throws the default Janrain framework for a loop then it tries to begin the auth request. From what I've seen it looks like it's probably the YADIS discovery that is throwing the error, which should be able to be bypassed since the discovery is on Google or Yahoo's end, but I'm not sure. This is all a big informal learning experience for me, and I haven't had any luck finding documentation that can help me on this one. Any tips would be greatly appreciated.

The control system with a certified control unit is based on the manufacturer for each control unit model obtaining a main encryption key from the Swedish Tax Agency. The manufacturer then uses the main key to create unique encryption keys that are placed in the control unit during the manufacturing process. In order to obtain main encryption keys, manufacturers must submit an application to the Swedish Tax Agency. Source SKV This has caused somewhat of an uproar among Swedish traders because of the necessitated complexity and strong encryption to be used, along with a highly sophisticated technical implementation from the shop owner's perspective, as the alternative is to buy the system from companies who have traversed the documentation, gotten their security keys and built the software and integrated it into the hardware. So my first question is if any other countries in the world even comes close to the preciseness that the Swedish Tax Agency requires of its companies (alongside having extensive guidelines for bookkeeping)? I'd like to hear about any other encryption schemes of interest and how they are applied through legislation when it comes to verifying the transactions and book keeping entries. Examples of such legislation could be similar to another Swedish rule; that book keeping entries (transactions) must be write-only, at most written 4 days after the occurrance and only changeable through a tuple of (date, signature of person doing it, new bookings). Finally, what are your opinions on these rules?

The problem is that in certain circumstances the ActiveDocument of our TWordApplication can be changed before the document is completed.

If this document is not closed after saving then it ""steals"" focus from the original. I think that it is legitimate that the user shouldn't need to remember to close down the second document. What I want to do is either switch the focus of WordApp to WordDoc or alternatively use WordDoc directly for the InsertFile - but this doesn't seem to be an option. (There is a third option where I collate the required data for the second document before I create the first document, but that will require a change in application logic.)

4309017,Performing Function Operations on One .xml Item (and Its Children) at a Time with lxml,"Just a heads up, I'm using lxml imported like this: . I'm trying to make some working code more flexible. My script takes an input .xml file containing all the items in an order by name, refers to a dictionary containing item ID numbers and item names to generate a list of item IDs based off that .xml file, and then polls a web server for the price data of those item IDs which it then uses to output a grand total cost. My question is not about any of these steps. Rather my question is about how to handle parsing an .xml file that contains more than one order in it. So far my sample .xml file might look like this: I can parse this into a list that includes both the base item carType (which is the model of car) and the various upgrades like this: and it would give me a list called like which I can run through my other functions to get the ID numbers for those items and from there get the price information and total it up to find out how much this Model1 car with a Leather Seat upgrade and a 6-Disc CD Player upgrade would cost. Here is where I run in to difficulty. How can I have multiple cars in one .xml file? An example might look like this: I want to run my functions on one order at a time so that this example would output 3 numbers - the grand total price of this Model1 car with its upgrades, the grand total price of the Model3 car with its upgrades, and the grand total price of the Model7 car with its upgrades.

It seems like scrolling also moves the links, but the link labels, the hidden fields and the parent div stays in the correct position. It is only visibile due to the wrong position of the link outlines (and of course, that the links dont work if i click them after scrolling). I was thinking about some weird margin collapse effect, but the elements inside are cleared, and overflow:auto is added to the parent. Maybe its some ASUS related bug? The content is HTML5.

But maybe this is not possible? UPDATE: Window's ""Performance Monitor"" perfmon seems the best approach so far for diagnosing such problems (thanks JP for the pointer) - but I am still struggling to use it in a successful way mainly due to the overwhelming number of options it provides. I have made some educated guesses at the things to monitor but so far the best information I can glean is that the following processes have unusual CPU/Data IO/Page faults during a freeze: , and .

4530342,SQLite/Fluent NHibernate integration test harness initialization not repeatable after large data session,"In one of my main data integration test harnesses I create and use Fluent NHibernate's , to get a fresh session for each test. After each test, I close the connection, session, and session factory, and throw out the nested StructureMap container they came from. This works for almost any simple data integration test I can think of, including ones that utilize Fluent NHib's object. The trouble starts when I test the application's lengthy database bootstrapping process, which creates and saves thousands of domain objects. It's not that the first setup and tear-down of the test harness fails, in fact, the test harness successfully bootstraps the in-memory database as the application would bootstrap the real database in the production environment. The problem occurs when the database is bootstrapped a second time on a new in-memory database, with a new session and session factory. The error is: The is indeed , the row that the application under test is looking for should be in the session. You see, it's not that any data from the last integration test is sticking around, it's that for some reason the session just stops working mid-database-boostrap. And I've looked everywhere for a place I might be holding on to an old session and I can't find one. I've searched through the code for singleton objects, but there are none anywhere near the code in question. I have a couple StructureMap singleton's but they are getting thrown out with each nested container that is lost after every test teardown. I've tried every possible variation on disposing and closing every object involved with each test teardown and it still fails on this lengthy database bootstrap. I've even messed around with to no avail. But non-bootstrap related database tests appear to work fine. I'm starting to run out of options and I may have to surrender lengthy database integration tests in favor of WatiN-based acceptance tests.

Even worse, if I drag the maximized RDS window away from the taskbar, to position it somewhere more convenient, it does a ""restore down"" instead of staying the ""maximized"" size. I can drag the corners to make it full size again, but it jumps back to the restore-down size if it's been minimized and restored. There surely must be a way to turn this behavior off?",[],False

4567813,"Strange ""A component named TFrm1 already exists"" error","I want to let the user to create multiple instances of the same form (let's call it Form1 which is a MDI child form). So I have two procedures like this where I create the forms. As you can see MyFrm is local var. This is ok for me as I don't need to programatically access the form after I create it. There is no other global variable named Frm1. In the OnClose event of MyFrm I have Action:= caFree; What could cause the error above? A user sent that error. It happened only once and I cannot reproduce it. Edit: The error appears in the ""MyFrm:= TFrm1.create"" line. Some people suggested that I need to programatically give unique names to my dynamically created forms. I also wondered myself what name a form takes when it is created so I stepped into the code while calling the MyProcedure1 procedure. Delphi automatically gives unique names like MyFrm.name= MyFrm, then MyFrm.name= MyFrm_1, MyFrm.name= MyFrm_2, MyFrm.name= MyFrm_3, and so on. The MyFrm.Name is not altered in LoadFromFile. I have checked (breakpoint) the value of 'MyFrm.Name' at the end of procedure MyProcedure1; after LoadFromFile. The name is unique. As some people suggested, I override the SetName procedure and checked the name of TMyFrm. Indeed each form gets a unique name. procedure TMyFrm.SetName(const Value: TComponentName); begin ShowMessage(Value); inherited; end; I have many forms in this app but only the MainForm is auto-created. I don't use threads. Anyway this will not be relevant since the forms are created by user (so multi-threading is irrelevant unless the user can create 2 forms at the same time).",['procedure MyProcedure1;           // procedure 2 is similar. it also has a var called MyFrm\nvar MyFrm: TFrm1;\nbegin\n  ... \n  MyFrm:= TFrm1.create(MainForm);\n  MyFrm.BringToFront;\n  MyFrm.LoadFromFile(someFile);\nend;\n'],False

4583676,Resource life cycles,"How do you manage the various resources who have differing life cycles? For instance a project manager will be the busiest during the initiation phase of a project and then utilized at some level (usually not 100%) during the execution/control phase. For developers the high utilization periods are the execution phase and QA towards the end of that phase (all resources might be utilized throughout the project, but at different utilization levels)...with changing dead-lines, etc...what approach have you used to best utilize the resources during those 'less utilized' periods? (newly added) To be clear - it's not about scheduling people during the project, but ensuring that they have work activities during parts of the project where they are not 100% needed. Using a QA person to program or a project manager to QA is usually not effective (not their specialty) - it has something to do with slack time, but to much slack time is bad for everyone - and it could require stacking lower priority work on them to ensure there's enough to keep they happily occupied....the question is, How Do you Manage this slack time?",[],False

4819279,Excel VBA: Making New Sheets From a Shared Column Value,"As a duty as work, I was told to open a spreadsheet in Excel 2003 (getting a newer computer soon...), and split the one sheet into a document with many worksheets based off of one ID: Vendor Id #. Worksheet has a one-row-high header. The first Header column is ""VendorID"". Now, there are DOZENS of other headers for each column here, and they contain equations. I want the sheets to be the name of the vendor ID. What I want is to get many sheets like so: A sheet called ""00708"", the A-column header of ""vendorId"", which contains: Just an example. There are MANY columns of different info. Many. My problem is that, at work, I tried this code: The problem is that this code worked BEAUTIFULLY....up until I scrolled more to the right and realized that many of the columns, while still appropriately moved, contained blank spaces where not only numbers used to be, but also numbers that are factored though Excel equations (adding values from cells next to them, that sort of thing) So basically....is there not a definitive code for this? I searched the web for hours but any code I tried would give me errors that I'm sorry to have not remembered so I could tell you. I'm pretty sure the code above was the one that worked, but it emitted vital information and equations and made them blank. I have ~8000 rows and know excel can do something like 65,000 rows. I've seen some code that tries to grab corner-to-corner regions, but I don't need that. I need a code that grabs every column and every row...looks at the first value of the first 'type' of info (in this case, Vendor ID), and then creates as many new sheets (in this same document) as it needs to to create one for every single different vendor ID. Any help would be much appreciated.

When the user clicks a ""I like this picture""-button, I do a $.ajax post to my Generic Handler, with the encrypted string and the value whether or not they liked the picture. The Generic Handler decrypts the supplied encrypted string and takes a look at the DateTime to determine if it was not too long ago When everything works out, the vote is submitted to the database.

First, I was using VLC media player to download mms, and then I started using Coojah (with Blader) to download an RTMP stream, and then I don't know what I will use next. One common problem faced by all: The stream temporarily goes off for a few seconds/minutes, and the download manager doesn't resume! It's a problem, because it's a live stream, so I end up losing content! If you know a particular hack to Coojah and Blader that will allow me to reconnect, then cool... Otherwise, share some way to resume the download generally - like maybe keeping track of the file size using some software? Please don't suggest alternate software to Coojah and Blader unless you know for sure it captures all RTMP streams and is free.",[],False
5031238,Timezone issues on new XAMPP install with PHP 5.3,"In response to the announcement that WordPress 3.2 (due later this month) will require PHP 5.2.4+, I upgraded my Windows test machine today from XAMPP 1.5.5 to 1.7.4, which in turn bumped me up from PHP 5.2.0 to 5.3.5. I've got just about everything working again, but one test page is behaving strangely. I have a MySQL table with tz identifiers by country code and the following script determines and displays the current time in each of the timezones: The expected output, which runs just fine on the production server in PHP 5.2.17, should be along the lines of: ...but instead I'm told that the time is the same as my system time, (currently UTC-4) in every zone: Now, I had noticed that line 1001 of the new installed with XAMPP 1.7.4 had originally contained , so I'd replaced it with . But in both cases, every instance of the function is being dictated by this setting regardless of anything I've said otherwise with . The same holds true for all other pages using (although , obviously, returns GMT as expected). I tried commenting out that line, but PHP 5.3.5 threw lovely errors saying that it's ""not safe to rely on the system's timezone settings"" and that I'm required to use the directive in , even though I always use when I use or similar functions. It's a bit frustrating to be forced to make a ""super-global"" setting, especially for a case like this where the whole point is to temporarily enter a new TZ environment and glean some useful information from it. So... Is there any way I can have the directive behave as a default that is overridable by such that the latter isn't completely ignored? Is there anything else you can think of that might be causing the unexpected/bizarre behavior outlined above? I'm inclined to believe that this is just some server setting that needs to be changed to allow to continue working in PHP 5.3.5 as it did in 5.2.0 (and does in 5.2.17). Of course, if there's a ""better way"" altogether, I wouldn't mind hearing about it (I always like learning new things!). But mostly I want my old code to work on my new install. Let me know if you need any more information about my setup.

5079812,Can I get result of a GWT async call before the page is rendered?,"I have a GWT page with a listing (from the datastore) on it. I understand how I can get this listing after the page is loaded, with an async call, but I want to make sure that when the page is loaded initially, it has valid data in it. Otherwise, the page loads most of the way, and then the listing is filled in, which leads to a choppy load, and a longer time the user needs to wait before the page loads. So, how can I get data from the server into the page when it loads? Is there a way to call the server-side service from the constructor of my UIBinder class? I can't call the actual service implementation, since the client-side code can't reference the server-side code, right? Surely this can't be a unique need, but I can't seem to find any tips on Google (though I might not be searching the right terms).",[],False

I have added following lines to .emacs (global-set-key ""\C-y"" 'scroll-up) (global-set-key ""\M-y"" 'scroll-down) When I hold Control and press y a few times, it will page down on every press of y. However, when I hold the Windows key (mapped as Meta) and press y a few times it will only page up on the first press of y and all subsequent presses of y I get the ‘y’ character inserted in the buffer.

I have nothing in my cron files, and no other services that I can think of that would be causing this:","['sudo /usr/local/bin/inotifywait -m -r /!(dev|proc)\n', 'type=SYSCALL msg=audit(10/03/2011 17:48:30.493:260) : arch=x86_64 syscall=open success=yes exit=4 a0=7f809205669a a1=80000 a2=1b6 a3=0 items=1 ppid=6466 pid=6467 auid=**** uid=root gid=**** euid=root suid=root fsuid=root egid=**** sgid=**** fsgid=**** tty=pts0 ses=79 comm=sudo exe=/usr/bin/sudo key=(null) \ntype=SYSCALL msg=audit(10/03/2011 17:48:30.493:261) : arch=x86_64 syscall=open success=yes exit=4 a0=7f809205669a a1=80000 a2=1b6 a3=0 items=1 ppid=6466 pid=6467 auid=**** uid=root gid=**** euid=root suid=root fsuid=root egid=**** sgid=**** fsgid=**** tty=pts0 ses=79 comm=sudo exe=/usr/bin/sudo key=(null) \ntype=SYSCALL msg=audit(10/03/2011 17:48:30.488:256) : arch=x86_64 syscall=open success=yes exit=3 a0=7f809205669a a1=80000 a2=1b6 a3=0 items=1 ppid=6441 pid=6466 auid=**** uid=**** gid=**** euid=root suid=root fsuid=root egid=**** sgid=**** fsgid=**** tty=pts0 ses=79 comm=sudo exe=/usr/bin/sudo key=(null)\n...\n', 'chkconfig | grep on\natd             0:off   1:off   2:off   3:on    4:on    5:on    6:off\ncgconfig        0:off   1:off   2:off   3:off   4:off   5:off   6:off\ncloud-init      0:off   1:off   2:on    3:on    4:on    5:on    6:off\ncloud-init-user-scripts 0:off   1:off   2:on    3:on    4:on    5:on    6:off\nconman          0:off   1:off   2:off   3:off   4:off   5:off   6:off\ncrond           0:off   1:off   2:on    3:on    4:on    5:on    6:off\niptables        0:off   1:off   2:on    3:on    4:on    5:on    6:off\nirqbalance      0:off   1:off   2:off   3:on    4:on    5:on    6:off\nlvm2-monitor    0:off   1:on    2:on    3:on    4:on    5:on    6:off\nmdmonitor       0:off   1:off   2:on    3:on    4:on    5:on    6:off\nnetconsole      0:off   1:off   2:off   3:off   4:off   5:off   6:off\nnetfs           0:off   1:off   2:off   3:on    4:on    5:on    6:off\nnetwork         0:off   1:off   2:on    3:on    4:on    5:on    6:off\nntpd            0:off   1:off   2:on    3:on    4:on    5:on    6:off\nrestorecond     0:off   1:off   2:off   3:off   4:off   5:off   6:off\nrsyslog         0:off   1:off   2:on    3:on    4:on    5:on    6:off\nsendmail        0:off   1:off   2:on    3:on    4:on    5:on    6:off\nsshd            0:off   1:off   2:on    3:on    4:on    5:on    6:off\nudev-post       0:off   1:on    2:on    3:on    4:on    5:on    6:off\nyum-updatesd    0:off   1:off   2:on    3:on    4:on    5:on    6:off\n']",False
5203796,"Why does mp4 video plays fine on iPad, not on iPhone?","I'm quite stumped on this issue. I have a large library of H.264 mp4 video files that I need to have play on iOS. Originally, I was targeting only iPad, but requirements have changed and now I need to include iPhone. But I've noticed that my iPod Touch, which has exactly the same OS version and build id as my iPad, won't play the same files that I've been successfully using on the iPad. I've confirmed this with a colleague who also has an iPhone and iPad with the same version &amp; build. I've also seen the exact same behavior in the iPad simulator, but until now I figured it was a quirk of the simulator. Now I'm not so sure. The mp4s are encoded with the following settings: I've tried loading the media off multiple servers and even locally and it doesn't seem to make a difference. If I export these files from QuickTime as m4v files, they play fine on all devices and simulators, so my gut tells me this is an encoder setting I'm missing. To eliminate all other possible factors, I've tried calling up the video files directly from the Mobile Safari address bar. I've confirmed this is happening on the following matching builds: Devices: 4.2.1 (8C148) - plays on iPad, not on iPhone. Simulators: 3.2 (7W367a) - plays okay on iPad (no iPhone version) 4.0.2 (8A400) - doesn't play iPhone (no iPad version) 4.1 (8B117) - doesn't play iPhone (no iPad version) 4.2 (8C134) - doesn't play iPhone or iPad I've gone through the iOS changelogs looking for anything that might explain why a video decompressor should work on one version and not another and I can't find anything that jumps out. Anyone have any ideas what could be behind this and how I can fix it?","['AVC Coding 640x360, Millions\nAAC, Stereo (L R), 44.100 kHz\n29.97 fps\n693.35kb/s\n']",False

5224363,ASP.NET Themes - Should They Be Used?,"I'd been reading up on themes in my ASP.NET book and thought that it could be a very handy solution, then I met some problems. The theme picks up every single CSS file in the folder If you want to use reset styles (where ordering is important) the order of imported stylesheets is not guaranteed Your master page would not explicitly indicate what style is being used, only the rendered page can tell you that unless you dig into your web.config Styling web controls using the theme file is... well... stupid? You can simply do this in your stylesheet. Granular control should be at the HTML level, should it not? How do you specify print stylesheets without having all styles in a single stylesheet? I'm wondering as to whether they're actually worth using at all. Is there any benefit? Are there any major sites using them? EDIT Just to clarify slolife's last point. If I had two stylesheets, one called print.css and one called main.css and I used ASP.NET themes, how would it know that print.css was a print stylesheet? In regular HTML you use the media type in the tag itself (i.e. ) but the themes wouldn't know this, so it would just get included as a regular stylesheet.",['&lt;link rel= ...&gt;'],False

Luckily I set each buttons' tooltip to be the name of the piece it is representing and this allowed him to test the game however as I'm sure you understand having to hover your mouse above every square just to know what is there is time consuming.

5250840,ASP.NET cache Application Variable,"I am wondering about potential issues with – alternatives to - caching using an application variable. To preface, I have a custom application object that stores all application data in ONE application variable – the object organizes data in an XML cloud and stores the cloud in one variable for performance. I am aware of DataSet caching, but all of my DAL objects select (read only) into data readers for performance, so if the solution involves DataSets I have a ton of refactoring to do – not ideal. Record count is low to medium, involving website data and small to medium project management apps; we're not talking a half-million records. Here is the structure of the function I intend to use in my DAL classes (Select All): So my cache returns all to the calling proc, then I LINK to filter the object (by active, by location). On insert, update, and delete I have one line of code to clear the cache. Again, I have the advantage of using read only data readers for performance, and my application object organizes XML into one application variable. MY thinking was that this is low overhead, not having to discard data readers for data sets when I'm just reading data. Thoughts? Opinions?

5274246,Filtering Data in ASP.NET Web Services,"I've been using this site for quite a while, usually being able to sort out my questions by browsing through the questions and following tags. However, I've recently come across a question that is rather hard to lookup amongst the great number of questions asked - a question I hope some of you might be able to share your opinion on. As my problem is a bit hard to fit into a single line, going in the title, I'll try to give a bit more details on the problem I've encountered. So, as the title says I need to filter, or limit, some of the response data my standard ASP.NET Soap-based Web service returns on invoking various web methods. The web service is used to return data used by other systems (a data repository more or less), where the client today is able to specify a few parameters on how the data should be filtered and in return a full-set of data back. Well, easy enough I thought, just put additional filtering options on the existing web methods which needs a bit more filtered applied, make adjustments on the server-side and we are all set to go - well, unfortunately it turned out to be a bit more tricky then this. The problem I am facing is that I'm working on a web service running in a production environment, which needs to be extended in such that additional filters can be applied to existing web method being invoked w/o affecting the calls already being made by other systems used by the customer using their client stubs. This is where I am a bit troubled, since I can't seem to find a ""right solution"" on extending the current web service. Today, the filter is send as a custom data structure which holds information on which data should filtered, but I am not sure if I can simply just add more information to this data structure w/o breaking code at the clients? One of my co-workers suggested that I could implement a solution where I would extend the web.config on the server-side to hold a section with details on which data should be excluded (filtered out), but I don't find this to be a viable solution long-sighted - and I don't trust customers with such an option since this is likely to go wrong at some point. So the solution I am looking for is a way that I can apply a ""second filter"" to the data I am requesting from the client so instead of getting a full-set of data back it should only give a fraction, it implemented in such that the filter can be easily modified and it must not affect the current client calls. Any suggestions on how I should approach this problem? Thanks! Kind regards, E.",[],False

I want to show that $f(z)$ is analytic if and only if $\overline{f(\bar{z})}$ is analytic, and by analytic I mean differentiable at each point. Here $f$ is a complex valued function. What I do is write $f(z)=u(x,y)+iv(x,y)$, where $u$ and $v$ are real functions of two variables. Then $\overline{f(\bar{z})}=u(x,-y)-iv(x,-y)$. These two forms look very similar, in the sense the one function being differentiable should immediately imply the other is differentiable, since the only thing really changing might be a $-$ sign popping out due to the chain rule. How can I more rigorously express that $f(z)$ is analytic iff $\overline{f(\bar{z})}$ using this? Many thanks.",[],False

And my questions are: 1. How to lie? e.g. in a function we take two values and return if they are the same, how I could have a best guess if the number of decimal(precision) is unknown? like b and c mentioned above? is there a well defined algorithm to do that? I was told that every language (C/C++) will have this kind of issue if we have floating point calculation involved, but how do they 'solve' this? 2. why we cannot just store the actual number instead of storing the closest number? is it a limitation or trading for efficiency? many thanks John","['&gt;&gt;&gt; b = 1.4 + 2.3\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b\n3.6999999999999997\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; c = 3.7\n&gt;&gt;&gt; c\n3.7000000000000002\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print b, c\n3.7  3.7\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b == c\nFalse\n']",False

5460824,Animation Layer Orientation,"Hello and thanks for looking at my question. I have an app that supports landscape orientation only (either left or right button). It launches in landscape-left. Great - it launches in correct orientation, and it even reorients views properly (I've customized the supported orientations method) between landscape left and right. Moving on to my question: I start the app and add a view. I start an animation and then swap my first view with a second (and a second with a third, etc). My problem is the animation isn't consistent. If I specify a kCATransitionFromLeft, my transition slides in from the TOP or the BOTTOM (depending on orientation of device). If I specify from kCATransitionFromRight, I get the same behavior. If I specify kCATransitionFromBottom or kCATransitionFromTop - then the transition appears correctly with the new view sliding in from the side, however, which side it originates from still depends on the orientation of the device. I want my view to always slide in from right to left. Obviously I could write an if/then to achieve this using kCATransitionFromBottom or kCATransitionFromTop, but my thought is that there must be an easier way. So, is there a simple way to have animations originate consistently according to the orientation? Why does a kCATransitionFromBottom not ALWAYS originate from the bottom? How would I even begin to modify this behavior? Thanks for any insights.",[],False

5487463,"Ensuring that ""finally"" runs on same thread when thread terminates","Here's a puzzle for you guys. I have a multithreaded program in which some threads work with managed resources like locks and semaphores. Some of the lock release primitives can only be performed from the same thread on which the lock acquire was done. So here's my puzzle: I wrap these kinds of operations: try { lock-acquire... do something } finally { lock-release }, but sometimes when my threads terminate, the finally clauses are performed by the .NET garbage collection thread and not by my thread. (The specific case actually involves the Dispose of an object allocated in a ""using"" statement; see below for details) This is a little tricky to demo; I see it all the time in Isis2, and I've figured out that this is happening by checking the thread-ids in the acquire and finalize blocks. But I don't have a 3-line demo for you, and I am sorry about that. I know it would make it easier to provide help. Is there a way I can delay termination for a thread until all pending finalize blocks associated with that thread have executed? ---- Details added for Mark ---- What I'm really doing involves a fairly elaborate self-instrumenting locking package that has various locking abstractions (bounded buffers, barriers, normal locks, etc) with thread priorities and designed to self-detect deadlocks, priority inversions, very slow lock grants and other problems. My code is complex enough and threaded enough so that I needed this to debug it. An example of my basic style of construct is this: A LockObject is a self-monitoring lock... a LockAndElevate makes note that I locked it (in this case) and later tracks the dispose, when I unlock it. So I'm exploiting the fact that using should dispose of the new object when the block completes -- even if it throws an exception. What I'm seeing is that fairly often, threads terminate and yet the using dispose events haven't actually occurred; they run later, on some other thread. This only happens when one of my threads terminates; in normal execution, the whole thing works like a charm. So since using translates to try... finally, my question was posted in terms of finally clauses.","['LockObject  myLock = new LockObject(""AnIsis2Lock"");\n\n...\n\nusing(new LockAndElevate(myLock)) { stuff }\n']",False

5580055,Code Reviews do they really work in true Agile?,"So I started working for a large corp., one of those with 3 letters in the name, and they are trying to become Agile, but have tons of processes, which I don't feel are Agile. The one that has me the most wound up are code reviews. My last job was with a startup that I would say is the most Agile development team I have seen, been on, and/or ever heard of. Anyway, my argument is that Code Reviews are a waste of time in iterative or Agile development where the UX/UI is extreme/intense (think Apple/Steve Jobs perfection). Maybe someone here can help understand before they fire me? Here is my development process and the one at my last startup... very Agile. We do the early feature work to sort development task/todos. We would mock a couple versions up and present to users, team, and marketing to get feedback. We then do another mockup iteration to get one round in from the same stakeholders above. Then we divvy up the work and get started. We have milestones and dates to meet, but we keep plugging away. We have no code reviews during any of this. Several times during the weeks of our development we hold sesssions with the stakeholders again to see if they still agree features/functions/UX/UI are still a fit and on target. As we approach the end of the 8 week iteration cycle QA starts testing, then it goes to alpha users, and finally to beta users. But during the alpha and beta developers are going over the new features and older features making iterative daily or hour changes to the UI to improve the UX. So a feature that was being developed this release, might end up being changed 3 more times the last four weeks to improve and perfect it or add a few tiny features (e.g. make the component a little slicker or smarter). Sometimes the changes might be superficial meaning no CRUD operations are changed or modified, but all UI only changes. So with this type of development process, extreme Agile, wouldn't code reviews be a waste of time? Meaning if I had another developer or two review my code, but then that code changes 3 more times before it goes out the door, because of all the UI/UX improvements, are we not wasting our time for first 3 times they reviewed it the code as that code/component/UI was scrapped? We never had many quality issues with this process and yes if a developer left all the knowledge walked out the door, but we always found smart developers to pick it up and takeover. And yes, we have a lot of testers because they may have to retest things 3 or 4 times. Also please don't get hung up on asking why all the UI/UX changes...thats just how things are done... been then thats why the app wins tons of awards for UI/UX and the users will kill for the app. The thought process is if I can make a even a 2% improvement in something because I have an extra hour then do it. Users will be happier, which means more $ or users. And yes, our users are ok with the app changing continuously because thats how its been done since day one so they don't see it as bad or a negative. Hope this post doesn't come off as pompous, but I just can't see how Code Reviews aren't wasteful. Maybe 2% of all our code in the code reviewed has bugs. Each release we might find 3 bugs via code review. So it ends up being 40 hours of code review per developer per release (4 x 40 = 160 hours) to find 3 to 5 bugs? Chances are 50% those 3 to 5 bugs would have been picked up by QA anyway. Wouldn't it be better to spend that 40 hour per developer adding a new feature or improving the existing ones?",[],False

5608660,disable_local_irq and kernel timers,"Hi Guys, While doing SMP porting of some of our drivers (on powerpc target) we observed some behaviour on which I need you guys to shed some light : On doing a local_irq_disable() on a UP system the jiffies tend to freeze ie the count stops incrementing. Is this expected? I thought that the decrementer interrupt is 'internal' and should not get affected by the local_irq_disable kindof call since i expected it to disable local IRQ interrupt processing (external interrupt). The system of course freezes then also upon doing a local_irq_enable() the jiffies count jumps and it seems to be compensating for the 'time lapse' between the local_irq_disable() and enable() call. Doing the same on an SMP system (P2020 with 2 e500 cores) the results are surprising. Firstly the module that is being inserted to do this testing always executes on core 1. Further it sometimes does not see a freeze of 'jiffies' counter and sometimes we see that it indeed freezes. Again in case of a freeze of count it tends to jump after doing a local_irq_enable(). I have no idea why this may be happening. Do we know in case of an SMP do both cores run a schedule timer, so that in some cases we do not see a freeze of jiffie counts or is it just on core 0 ? Also since the kernel timers rely on 'jiffies' -- this would mean that none of our kernel timers will fire if local_irq_disable() has been done ? What would be the case this is done on one of the cores in an SMP system ? There are many other questions, but I guess these will be enough to begin on a general discussion about the same :) TIA NS Some more comments from the experimentation done. My understanding at this point in time is that since kernel timers depend on 'jiffies' to fire, they wont actually fire on a UP system when I issue a local_irq_save(). Infact some of our code is based on the assumption that when I do issue a local_irq_save() it guarantees protection against interrupts on the local processor and kernel timers as well. However carrying out the same experiment on an SMP system, even with both cores executing a local_irq_save(), the jiffies do NOT stop incrementing and the system doesnt freeze. How is this possible ? Is LINUX using some other mechanism to trigger timer interrupts in the SMP system or possibly using IPIs ? This also breaks our assumption that local_irq_disable will protect the system against kernel timers running on the same core atleast. How do we go about writing a code that is safe against async events ie interrupts and kernel timers and is valid for both UP and SMP.",[],False

I've got three activities in my app, and the user switches back and forth pretty frequently. I've also got a remote service, which handles a telnet connection. The apps need to bind to this service in order to send/receive telnet messages. Edit Thank you BDLS for your informative answer. I have re-written my code in light of your clarification on the difference between using bindService() as a stand-alone function or after startService(), and I now only get the leak error message intermittently when using the back button to cycle between activities. My connection activity has the following onCreate() and onDestroy(): So the service is started when the activity is started, and stopped when the activity is destroyed if no successful telnet connection was made (connectStatus == 0). The other activities bind to the service only if a successful connection was made (connectStatus == 1, saved to a shared preferences). Here is their onResume() and onDestroy(): So the binding happens in onResume() so that it will pick up the changed state from the connection activity, and in the onDestroy() function it is unbound, if necessary. End Edit But I still get the memory leak error message ""Activity has leaked ServiceConnection @438030a8 that was originally bound here"" intermittently when switching activities. What am I doing wrong? Thanks in advance for any tips or pointers!!! Full error message follows (from the revised code): Edit the 2nd Thanks once again bdls for your suggestions. I did as you suggested and added an onUnBind() override to the service. onUnBind() is actually only triggered when all clients disconnect from the service, but when I hit the home button, it executed, then the error message popped up! This makes no sense to me, as all the clients have been unbound from the service, so how could the one destroyed leak a serviceConnection? Check it out: I thought it might be something like you said, where the binding to the service is not complete when unbindService() is called, however I tried calling a method on the service as I backed through each activity to verify that the binding is complete, and they all went through fine. In general, this behavior doesn't seem related to how long I stay in each activity. Once the first activity leaks its serviceConnection, however, they all do as I back through them after that. One other thing, if I turn on ""Immediately destroy activities"" in Dev Tools, it prevents this error. I'm stumped, any ideas?

5772258,Email Verification plugin for rails?,"I'd like to verify a user's email address by sending them a verify-email-message. Do you know of a good Rails plugin that they've used or seen? Since I didn't see anything good via Google, at this point, my thought is: Add a verified boolean field to the user model. Default false. After user is added (unverified), combine email with a salt (a secret), and create the sha1 hash of the email/salt combo. The result is the verification. Send a welcoming / verification email to the user. Email includes a url that has the email address and verification as GET args to a verify action on my server. The verify action recomputes the verification using the supplied email and checks that the new verification matches the one in the url. If it does, then the User rec for the email is marked 'verified' Also will provide action to re-send the verification email. Any comments on the above? Thanks, Larry",[],False

5832952,How to Trigger autohide on the taskbar on WindowsCE,"im writing a C# program for a Windowsce 5.0 Device (PSION Teklogix Workabout Pro G2). The taskbar is set to autohide. I can't disable it completely, because the user sometimes needs to access the start menu or may like to manually show or hide the SIP. And it should not be displayed all the time, because i'd like to use as much of the small display as possible. My problem is: When the taskbar is minimized at the bottom of the screen and a user clicks somewhere on it (not the startmenu button), it will slide in and is shown correctly. But if the user does not activate the startmenu (by clicking on the windows-Logo), the taskbar won't slide out again, unless the startmenu was opened once. Is there something like an event or so, that i could send to the taskbar, so it hides again, without the user beginning to access the startmenu ?",[],False

The relevant parts of the email headers are: As you can see, the email was initially intended for ""webmaster (at) daniel-marschall.de"", but now it has the field ""To: webmaster (at) viathinksoft.com"", so my MTA dropped the mail to the owner of viathinksoft.com .

5997592,Architecture definition: MVC 3 (Sharp architecture) + Multi-Tenancy,"I would like to share my thoughts with you and try to get some advice. I would like to define my application with the best architecture as possible. Any comment would be highly appreciated. Here we go... My technologies: Sharp Architecture 1.9 (MVC3, NHibernate, Castle Windsor, etc...) and SQLServer database My busniess case: SaaS application. Many customers with many users each one, one database per customer and the same code (just one instance) of our code Problem: I need to allow multiple users to connect to different databases at the same time with the same code (just one installation). As far as I know Sharp Architecture doesn't support this stuff by default After some research I found a new concept for me: Multi-Tenancy. I guess that is the proper way to do it. So question is: Is my assumption correct? Is multi tenancy the best way to reach my goal? On the other hand I found a couple of interesting links: http://weblogs.asp.net/zowens/archive/tags/Multi-tenancy/default.aspx (MVC approach) http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa479086.aspx Someone could provide me aditional info?

5998372,Debug a binary on different IDE,"i have the following situation. I need to build a executable on a sparcv8 architecture workstation. Everything works fine there. Now i want to take this executeable and debug it on a windows workstation using eclipse. Since it is not possible to execute sparcv8 code native on a intel workstation we use a simulator called tsim (sparcv8 simulator) to execute the code there. The binary gets compiled with debugging information turned on. As far as i know that means that the symboltable + unix-style paths to the source files were added to the binary. Do i need to transform this information (symbol table) before i can use it eclipse on windows? I did not find any info regarding this topic inside mailing lists or using google. As far as i know it is possible without symboltable support, but debugging software on assembler level is to time-consuming in this case. thanks in advance",[],False

If i get S, great. if not, call the function again, but from n-1, obviously if the array is size 1 or lower, i print that there arent 2 such values. Anyone has any better ideas?

Now the webservice is using the javax.ejb.Stateless as I selected the ""Implement Web Service as a Stateless Session Bean"" checkbox, but no Library containing this class is added and I get an error in Netbeans: ""cannot find symbol: class Stateless"" ofcourse it can't. When I add the ""Java EE Web 6 API Library - javaee-web-api-6.0.jar"" the error is solved, but when I deploy the project I get an error thats a whole lot more difficult, and that error is the actual problem... at the following line: I put the arguments over different lines like this: Which didn't help me at all(but maybe it does help you), because the eror was at the line: Now if I comment out the Stateless usage, and remove the ""Java EE Web 6 API Library - javaee-web-api-6.0.jar"" library, there is no problem and it all works like a charm.
