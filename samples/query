I also have a bit of a problem understanding the Time-Driven trigger. What does ""7pm to 8pm"" mean? Once between those two hours at a random time? The script only makes sense if I don't have to be logged into Google Docs. Maybe I'm totally misunderstanding something here... Do scripts only work if I'm logged into Google Docs? (But even if I am, as of now, the script doesn't execute with the Time-Driven trigger). I very much appreciate your thoughts on this.

It uses the various API's available on the web to determine a ""count"" of shares or likes across facebook, twitter, delicious, linkedin, stumbleupon, digg etc. Many of you are probably familiar with javascript widgets for these sites. I'm frustrated with the overhead which this brings (multiple javascript calls, so I'm building something to work this out and store natively within Wordpress). This will also give scope for designers creating their own buttons with HTML, and a shortcode will show the share count. My problem lies in the speed of the response for the networks. They can be slow, so I'm looking for architecture / design advice. I was thinking of creating a table which holds POST_ID and a collection of scores which is updated often via WP-CRON.. and updates when a user clicks the share button as well to keep it in synch.

In principle what I want to do is something like this: Looking around I found the following solutions, none of which seem to properly work: Using dynamic sql and just insert the list as a string of comma seperated elements. Works only for short lists. Long lists break the 4000 char limit for command string literals. (Btw.: I don't need to worry about sql injection attacks, so in principle dynamic sql would be an option.) Using associative arrays in a stored proc. From what I could find the only way to use associative arrays in a stored proc is to iterate over them but that would give terrible performance when I want to get all the differenct occurence of elements in a list in a table. Using bind arrays with a stored proc. Same issue here: Since the stored proc is called once for every element in the bind array the performance is terrible. Inserting the list that I want to use in the where clause into the db beforehand and then executing a query which has something like in place of . The performance here turned out to be better than for option 2. and 3. but worse than for option 1 and an additional disadvantage is that the user that executes the query needs to have write access to this one table on the database even though he just wants to read from the db.

So, I ran the first sum through Maple and it gave me: $$ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(n^{2}+k^{2})^{2}}=\frac{{\pi}^{2}}{4}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\coth^2(\pi n)}{n^{2}}+\frac{\pi}{4}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\coth(\pi n)}{n^{3}}-\frac{{\pi}^{2}}{4}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{2}}-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{4}}$$ Of course, two of these are the very familiar $\zeta(2), \;\ \zeta(4)$.

340169,"homeomorphism related question, how to show two space is homeormophic to each other or not","I am having difficulties in solving the following two questions. 1) For the first question, the author of the text states that if $f:[a,b]\rightarrow R$ is a map, then $\text{Im} f$ is a closed, bounded interval. Question: Let $X \subseteq R$, and $X$ is the union of the open intervals $(3n, 3n+1)$ and the points $3n+2,\text{ for } n= 0,1,2,\dots$. Let $Y=(X-\{2\})\cup \{2\}$. Prove that there are continuous bijections $f:X\rightarrow Y, g:Y\rightarrow X$, but that $X, Y$ are not homeomorphic. I can create the bijection from $X\text{ to }Y$, and $Y\text{ to }X$. From $X\text{ to }Y$, I would map $\{2\}\text{ to }\{1\}$ and everything else would get mapped to itself, so I get both an injective and surjective mapping. From the $Y\text{ to }X$ direction, I would just map $\{1\}\text{ to }\{2\}$ and everything else would get mapped to itself. I get again a bijective mapping But how do I show that map from $X\text{ to }$Y and also $Y\text{ to }X$ are both continuous? $X$ is composed of open intervals and singletons, likewise for the set $Y$. Am I suppose to impose some sort of topology on $X\text{ and }Y$ and then describe the basis elements? Also, why are the sets $\text{Im }F\text{ and Im }g$ not bounded or closed? For the second problem: Construct the homeomorphism $f:[0,1]\times[0,1]\rightarrow[0,1]\times[0,1]$ such that $f$ maps $[0,1]\times\{0,1\} \cup \{0\}\times[0,1]$ onto $\{0\}\times[0,1]$. My difficulties with this question are: Am I to interpret $[0,1]\times\{0,1\} \cup \{0\}\times[0,1]$ to mean $([0,1]\times\{0,1\}) \cup (\{0\}\times[0,1])$? If so, then $([0,1]\times\{0,1\}) \cup (\{0\}\times[0,1])$ is a subset of $([0,1] \cup \{0\})\times(\{0,1\} \cup [0,1])$, by a property of of the cartesian product.

349388,Speed Improvement of a .Net Based Modelling Application,"We are developing one anayltical tool of stock moddeling in .Net. The primary objective of the tool is to Run a Model for 5 years and do projections for future In, Out and Stock for various Products. The primary workflow of the code is 1. Fetch the data from database. 2. For each date Process Data (Run Production and Stock Model) 3. After All the dates are traversed update all the data together in database. So primarily there are only two database calls and initially we take all the data in datasets and then we process it in Ram and do not make database calls. The problem we faced that it was taking almost an hour to run a model for 1 year. Our benchmark is to run the model for 5 years in 5 minutes. We have been working on this problem for almost a month now. Right now we have been able to achieve running model for 1 year in 10 mins. Following are the things that we have found out. - While fetching data from the data set if the tables carrry all five years data it was difficult to fecth so we divided the data sets in monthly loops and now we run model for a month at a time. This has given us the maximum improvement in speed. - Tried to reduce for loops inside the model which runs daily. This did not give us much improvement. You can download one rar file from following link. http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4546390/iPlanner.rar It contains three file. iPlanner Tables.xls : which is giving idea of database design. iPlanner Logic.xls : talks about table and the logic of production model, shipment model and actual value handling. I think the most important is to look at the production model, this will give you a brief idea of what the model does daily. Common.cs : which has the Call Production Model function from where everything starts. You can check that out too. The model was previously written in excel in excel it used to take 2 mins for 5 years. The reason to move to .Net is to have more sharing features and have a software like look. I am trying to find out the ways in which this can be improved. Let me know if more information is required on this. Thanks in Advance",[],False

Cheers, Chris ========== UPDATE (cannot answer my own question...) ============ Cheers, Phillip and rang, that pointed me in the right direction. I do understand that EXC_BAD_ACCESS indicates a dealloc'd object, but in this case that just wasn't possible since the main class of the system was holding onto the object in question (the Heatmap). The problem turned out to be a race condition between the creation of the Heatmap and the populating of the data model it shares. The populating was happening, occasionally, before the Heatmap was finished being created (both are event-driven). I ended up re-working the code so that the class holding the Heatmap makes a synchronous call to populate the data after the Heatmap is cleaner. Thanks for the input, it saved me a headache. :) Chris","['-[__NSMallocBlock__ handleMessagesReceived:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x9855cd0\n', 'NSDictionary *notificationInfo = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:outputArray forKey:@""messages""];\n[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName:kMESocialHeatmapMessagesReceivedNotification object:nil userInfo:notificationInfo];\n', '[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(handleMessagesReceived:) name:kMESocialHeatmapMessagesReceivedNotification object:nil];\n', '- (void)handleMessagesReceived:(NSNotification *)notification {...}\n']",False

Here is the definition given in the textbook by Bronsted: Linear Hull: For any $M \subset \mathbb{R}^{d}$ the linear hull $\operatorname{span}{(M)}$ is the set of all linear combinations of vectors from $M$. So, I considered a simple example consisting of the following vectors: $x_1 = \langle -2, 1, 1 \rangle, x_2 = \langle 3, -1, -1 \rangle, x_3 = \langle 2, 0, 1 \rangle$. The equation of the planes for which linear combinations of each two vectors generates in $P_{x_{i}x_{j}}$ form are as follows: $$P_{x_1 x_2} = y -z, P_{x_2 x_3}=-x -5y + 2z, P_{x_1 x_3}=x+4y-2z $$ We can plot this in Mathematica as follows: So, is the linear hull of this subset $M$ of $\mathbb{R}^{d}$, the set of all vectors that lie in one of the three planes I listed?

Basically, I want to create a feture in Visual Studio that will do the following: When activated, places an option/link in the site collection options in Site Actions. This link will then open a page with a completely different user interface page that has several selectable options for the user. Say for example the user selects a list and some fields or other options and those selections will be stored somewhere (this is what I really want to know how to do). Then the user will ""Apply"" the settings and this action will then render custom content in a custom delegate control stored in the master page. I know it sounds like a webpart, but I have seen many of these things and they do not look like webparts and there are no webpart zones. I believe they are custom controls which I have built before and I have built custom delegate controls. I am wanting mainly a cool user interface that runs on the SharePoint page and somehow stores the options and this is global at the site collection. Whew! I tried to be as detailed as possible, but I am just not sure what the correct terms are for some of these things. I have built custom application pages and that may be what it is, but I just do not know how to store the selected options so that they are then used to create the HTML that will be placed in the delegate control. EDIT: A good example to a point would be Nintex Workflow or something similar. Though I am not trying to build a workflow tool. I know it creates a workflow, but it also stores the settings and user selections that create the workflow and it has a great user interface. That's what I would like to have for my custom tool.

And with XP being phased out, this question isn't so relavent anymore. Since the Windows 2000 logo requirements, Microsoft has been requiring that applications run as standard user. Like everyone else i always ran my desktop as an administrative user. And like every developer: i log in, develop, run, and test as an administrative user. Now with a new push to finally support standard users, i've been testing my applications by running them as a normal user - either through RunAs, or having my application relaunch itself with normal rights using / if it detects it is running as an administrator. i quickly see how specacularly some of my apps fail under Windows XP as a standard user (due to my own stupidity). i also see how the same applications work fine under Vista (thanks to it's numerous shims to fix my bugs for me). Aside: It's ironic that applications are more likely to run on Vista as a standard user than on XP. The question is do you test your applications for standard user compatiblity? Do you develop as a standard user on XP? Do you ignore standard user access and hope for the best? i tried, as a bonus, to have my app relaunch itself as a limited user (rather than normal user). It doesn't even come up - Windows says it failed to initialize. So there an area of future research on my part: making the app even support limited user. i specifically referred to standard users on XP rather than Vista to enforce the truth that Vista is no different from XP as far as compatibility is concerned.

If I have 3 facets on 3 different attributes, when I select a facet once I already have on selected, I would like to display only results falling into both of those facests. As of now, it just switches from one facet to the other. I feel like this shouldn't be that difficult, but I can't figure out how to do it.

603337,"High quality, emotional, fluent and variable Text-to-Speech engine?","After looking at some of services/tools, I've come to a conclusion. Most Text-to-Speech tools have too techy, robotic - in other words, bad quality c voices. And yeah, on top of that, it looks like they come with a ""hard-coded"" voice templates, therefore shortening the variety/customization. Some tools allow you to set the reading speed and pitch', but that's not enough. My guess about the problem behind the emotional aspect - it's hard to judge emotions from plain text, even more if it's just a sentence or two. Plus, the good ol' PC is a machine - machines don't have emotions, but that's a different story. The thing that bothers me the most, is, quality. For example, there are these tools out there, that use to cut off apex of words, resulting in these techy voices. Feels like there's a problem with sentence construction or something. And yes, while people are working on such tools, I wonder, what keeps them from working a little more to improve those... cutting off the apex, that's not a small deal! Plus, have to keep in mind, that a good, quality Text-to-Speech software is worth, well... A LOT! Therefore resulting in a pretty profitable product. Oh, under fluency I'm hiding questions, exclamations and so on. (Possible that those do not apply to fluency, but I'm not native English, please excuse me if that's the case.) A list of tools I've looked into: Quite impressive, but still have space for improvements (++) - Loquendo : lacks voice variety, got some minor apex/fluency problems (depends on sentence), too much coughing and excuses in examples! - Nuance Vocalizer : while still lacks variety, some of the provided voices are worthy. Could as well cooperate to get more resources then to work on different, but almost equal products (--) - eSpeak : one of the best robots out there, hence the program logo(?!) - Natural Reader (dumb autoplay!!) : well, it got some fluency, but still that techy feeling kicks in. - iSpeech : good laugh when setting the voice to Japanese with English text. I bet Japanese guys aren't very happy about it. - Cepstral + Enhanced Voices ... plus the enhanced voices give the good ol' crappy result, so, except ~5 more voices, nothing have been enhanced. - AT&amp;T : decent fluency, but got problems with sentence endings and too much robo! - LumenVox TTS : looks like coming from a background with lots of speech tools, but still results in robotic voices. - And some more... In case I've missed something worth a look, please share. Can be free, commercial, super expensive... as long as it works, I'm interested! And the question(-s).. What do you think are the main issues behind quality, fluency and variety of those voices? Since emotional aspect is hard to judge, I don't mind if you skip it, but if you have an idea or two, I wouldn't mind if you shared your thoughts How is text transformed into speech? Like, what algorithms are used behind these tools? Maybe a fresh theory or two could come in handy. Are those actually different engines/drivers or just different voice patterns for the same driver/engine? Is it just me, or the quality between one of the first Text2Speech tools hasn't changed much (or at all) over the years?

There is a single program that runs as a service and performs selects, updates and inserts on the table quite often (approximately every 5 minutes). The selects are used only to determine which rows are to be updated, and they are based on a column that holds boolean values (probably translated to integer internally by SQLite). There is also a web application that performs selects (always with a GROUP BY clause) whenever a web user wishes to view part of the data. There are two ways to ask for data through the web application: (a) predefined filters (i.e. the where clause has specific conditions on 3 specific columns) an (b) custom filters (i.e. the user chooses the values for the conditions, but the columns participating in the where clause are the same as in (a)). As mentioned, in both cases there is a GROUP BY operation. I am wondering whether using a view or a custom function might increase the performance.

635252,is there any data that supports SSDs as more environmentally friendly?,"I'm trying to come up with a case for replacing our laptop HDDs with SSDs in our IT dept. Besides saving a lot of developer time, is there any data out there to support my argument that they are more environmentally friendly? Esp. with regard to construction and power consumption. Can you think of any thing that I'm missing? Update1: I am routinely slowed down by my HDD. I'm on a laptop so my swap file is sitting on a 5400 rpm hdd. I typically sit at 80% memory used when developing so I hit the swap a lot. I have the option of going to a 64b OS (minimal gain really, considering I only have 1 mem slot free) or upgrading to an SSD. So I'm losing time already all the time. So assuming I will replace the drives, is there an environmental bonus over the long term to replacing the drive? Update2: What about power over a year? How much power would a laptop consume being used 40 hours a week and hitting the swap very frequently on a HDD vs. SSD?",[],False
639672,MDB not reconnecting to a foreign server when it becomes available in WL 10,"We are using WebLogic 10, and I have created a Foreign Server on machine 1, which is listening to a Topic on machine 2. when I deploy my MDB on machine 1, which is using the Foreign server to receive messages from the Topic on machine 2, I get the following warning state for the MDB: MDB application stella-core-cachedservices-account-server-ear is NOT connected to messaging system This only happens when the server on machine 2 is down. I do not get this message when the server on machine 2 is up.

704997,What NoSQL solution is best to store Apache error_log and access_log? Cassandra or MongoDB?,"We have developed PaaS solution for PHP. As part of that we offer developers to see Apache error_log and access_log files through our API. Currently we write the logs into files on disk seperated per deployment (vhost). Since this doesn't scale too well with a higher number of nodes and deployments, even though files are on distributed filesystem (GlusterFS), we would like to switch to something better. Especially for billing and statistical reasons we would prefer not to parse log files every time. As MongoDBs copped collections look awesome for logging we wanted to go with that. But turns out they don't seem to work with auto sharding which kind of spoils the point for us since we expect much more writes then reads. The other option was Cassandra which I like for it's every node is equal approach, but they don't have something like capped collections. Turns out neither of the two solutions offers a distinct feature that helps me make a decision, or I don't see it. So what I'd want to know is has anybody used one of the two systems for logging before? What are your experiences, can you give me some tips?

I've used this exact same BCrypt class on at least a couple of other projects in the past, and never had any problems with it at all. Is ASP.NET MVC 3 doing some weird, different encoding to posted data that I'm missing or need to handle differently or something? Either that, or is SQL CE 4 doing it (that's the datastore I'm currently using)? Everything seems to be in order in my code from what I can tell, but for some reason, password checking is failing every time. Anyone have any ideas? Thanks.

827939,Java - Throttling SOAP API calls,"I'm building a Java application which makes requests to a SOAP API.

848953,User specific version of extensions from Chrome Web Store,"I've been developing and maintaining a Chrome extension for my company where each customer would be assigned a unique ID in the code. We've been using the ID to determine license status and login to our services (paid extension with monthly subscription fee). So far we've hosted the extension files ourselves and had unique update URLs for each customer extension. This has been nice and simple; go to our website, click install and you're done. With the latest Chrome release, however, that installation procedure has been thwarted by Google since they now require users to install extensions by dragging and dropping the CRX files into the chrome://chrome/extensions/ tab. Unless of course your extension is available through Chrome Web Store - which leads me to the problem: We don't want the drag and drop CRX installation - requires Web Store. We don't want multiple versions of the extension (one for each customer) on the Web Store since that's a maintenance hell every time we update the extension. We don't want to use Web Store licensing because: It requires OpenID login. We sell the extension to schools with many students where the school pays the bill - not the student. We don't want to lock our payment method to one browser, i.e. we want to be able to maintain licensing and payment through our or servers. We don't want to have users input a license key since that's too much of a risk with several thousand students having to input the key - also it requires some kind of storage (cookies/localStorage) which would eventually get cleared requiring the license key to be input again. I'm not 100% certain that my statements are completely correct, so feel free to enlighten me if I missed something. If they are, the question is whether or not we can somehow tailor the extension for each customer through the Web Store (using the unique ID) without needing to publish one extension per ID?

870006,PVCS to SVN migration - How to write PVCS Labels to SVN Log Msg,"SVN import that does the job quite nicely for us but we have one issue. We have made extensive use of PVCS labels and these give us a clear and consistent link to our Work Request numbers (W.R.). When we migrate to SVN these labels become tags (which in itself is fine) BUT we're also implementing JIRA and so need to link the appropriate SVN version to a JIRA issue number. This is done by writing the JIRA issue number into the SVN log message. So far; at SVN Import time I am reading each SVN log message and where I find a work request number I append the appropriate JIRA issue number to the SVN log message (using a post-commit script in SVN). However the practice of writing the W.R. into the PVCS commit description has been optional whereas the use of PVCS labels has been mandatory. Therefore many of the versions do not have a W.R. number in the log, only in the PVCS label (or as it becomes SVN Tag). Is there any way I can find the PVCS version label during the SVN import? I can see them in the dump file created by the PVCS export where they become a part of the Node-path. Or alternately is there a report or query I can run that will give me a list of revisions for each tag? Regards Karl",[],False

1027491,priority_queue with dynamic priorities,"Hey, I have a server application which accepts incomming queries and executes them. If there are too many queries they should be queued and if some of the other queries got executed the queued queries should be executed as well. Since I want to pass queries with different priorities I think using a priority_queue would be the best choice. e.g. The amout of the axcepting queries (a) hit the limt and new queries will be stored in the queue. All queries have a priority of 1 (lowest) if some of the queries from (a) get executed the programm will pick the query with the highest priority out of the queue and execute it. Still no problem. Now someone is sending a query with a priority of 5 which gets added to the queue. Since this is the query with the highest priority the application will execute this query as soon as the running queries no longer hit the limit. There might be the worst case that 500 queries with a priority of 1 are queued but wont be executed since someone is always sending queries with a priority of 5 hence these 500 queries will be queued for a looooong time. In order to prevent that I want to increase the prioritiy of all queries which have a lower priority than the query with the higher priority, in this example which have a priority lower than 5. So if the query with a priority of 5 gets pulled out of the queue all other queries with a priority &lt; 5 should be increased by 0.2. This way queries with a low priority wont be queued for ever even if there might be 100 queries with a higher priority. I really hope someone can help me to solve the problem with the priorities: Since my queries consist of an object I thought something like this might work:","['class Query {\npublic:\n    Query( std::string p_stQuery ) : stQuery( p_stQuery ) {};\n    std::string getQuery() const {return stQuery;};\n    void increasePriority( const float fIncrease ) {fPriority += fIncrease;};\n\n    friend bool operator &lt; ( const Query&amp; PriorityFirst, const Query&amp; PriorityNext ) {\n        if( PriorityFirst.fPriority &lt; PriorityNext.fPriority ) {\n            if( PriorityFirst.fStartPriority &lt; PriorityNext.fStartPriority ) {\n                Query qTemp = PriorityFirst;\n                qTemp.increasePriority( INCREASE_RATE );\n            }\n\n            return true;\n        } else {\n            return false;\n        }\n    };\n\nprivate:\n    static const float INCREASE_RATE = 0.2;\n    float fPriority; // current priority\n    float fStartPriority; // initialised priority\n    std::string stQuery;\n};\n']",False

1041134,Deploy multiple applications in Cherokee and distinguish them by port?,"I am having an issue on deploying applications with Cherokee web server. The thing is I need to host various Django applications in the same machine and distinguish each one by ports (i.e. app1 in port 8181, app2 in port 8282... you know). It is very easy to deploy a Django/uWSGI app in Cherokee, as you only need to follow a very simple form and its web interface will do the magic. I can declare all the apps that I want, but I don't find the way to put them to work in a specified port. 'Rules' menu. I can access one of them when I change the root directory of the 'default' virtual server to it, BUT I can't access the rest of the virtual servers because Cherokee always points me to the server which root directory I have defined in 'default'. Anyone knows what configuration I missed or can point me to the way to the solution? I checked up Cherokee documentation and a lot of how-tos, but them does not cover this particular issue.

1048909,"Responsive HTML Page Design (PC, Tablet, Smartphone) with Table or Table-less Forms","I am working on a web application, which is PC based, but support for tablets and smartphones is envisaged in the not so distant future. We are using Twitter Bootstrap (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html) and JQuery as the CSS/Javascript core. For most of previous development we have used tables to layout our forms as most of the applications were targeted to desktop usage, therefore using tables was just right in laying out the forms (most of them two column) to ensure alignment and so on. However now that we are looking into adding mobile devices with limited screen real estate, and given the fact that not all the forms will be accessible in to the smart phones, I have started wondering whether we should keep the tables and create table-less forms for the mobile device. I am sure Twitter Bootstrap will provide us with the needed support for the table less forms, but I still wonder is it a major issue in 2012? Being a new application we also have the choice of forcing the users to have the latest browser versions to access the application, but what does this say for mobile first design? I know that this has been discussed over the years, but I am looking for a 2012 look at this question with the tools available.",[],False

Forward declaring class B seems to work (i.e. no compiler warnings/errors) but i am not sure if it is legal as per C++11 standard. Also, such a solution won't allow me to use a constructor of class B to provide in-class initializer for class B type members of A. What would be the best possible way to accomplish all of this in conformance to C++11? I tried finding a solution from the standard itself but couldn't find mention of such a scenario. I'd be happy if someone could point me to it. PS I am really a beginner, so please don't assume otherwise in your answers. I wouldn't mind detailed answers though:)",[],False

1117512,PHP: i need to examine the words in an input string by user and according to the matchs ouput a response,"At the moment I have a very simple autoresponder/chatbot. To get it to play a more complex role (like a help bot) it needs to be heavily modified. I'm not a php programmer but I think I know what needs to be done after a little research, I just don't understand fully the articles on pregmatch and fopen etc at php.net. I know I can download a readymade helpbot but where is the learning curve for me in that? i'm not in a hurry either and I enjoy these little challenges. I have asked this question elsewhere and the knowitalls there either knew nothing or simply couldn't be bothered - they just kept telling me to download a prefab helpbot. Any help would be greatly appreciated but please don't send me back to the php manuals because I have already tried to work with that. I need a fresh approach. I have a form for users to input a (maxlength) 50 character text question. I think it would be an advantage to limit the number of characters a user can input so that the manipulation of the strings becomes easier. Once the user submits the question it needs to be passed to a variable. I want to compare the words in the string with a list of words in a file then if the words don't exist in the file already ad them to it. identify certain keywords (eg: who;what;where;when;how;why;which) to break down the question identify any nouns to further breakdown the question (the nouns obviously will be a rather large list that i will have to manually create). compare the results with a list of responses (another list I will manually create). output the best matching response. The following code is basic and doesn't yet check the input string for combinations of keywords. I've commented the code as best as I can understand it. The following is my responder002.php file:","['/*create the \'question\' variable for the users text to be stored in:*/\n\n$question=strtolower($_POST[\'question\']));\n\n/*begin creating the form*/\n$ask=\'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;form action=""responder002.php"" method=""POST""&gt;Question: &lt;input type=""text"" name=""question""&gt;\n&lt;input type=""submit"" value=""Ask""&gt;&lt;/form&gt;\';\n$answer=\'&lt;h2&gt;Answer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\';\n/*if the $question variable is empty then ask for input*/\nif (empty($question))\n{\n  print $ask;\n\n  exit;\n}\n/*otherwise ....*/\nelse\n{\n\n  /*if the variable contains the following strings output to screen the matching response*/\n  if ($question==""hello""||$question==""Hello""||$question==""hi""||$question==""Hi""||$question==""G\'day""||$question==""hey"")\n  {\n    $answerq=""Hello how are you?"";\n  }\n  if ($question==""good""||$question==""good thanks"")\n  {\n    $answerq=""Im glad to hear you are good."";\n  }\n  if ($question==""fine""||$question==""fine thanks"") {\n    $answerq=""Im glad to hear you are fine."";\n  }\n\n  echo \'&lt;i&gt;You asked me:&lt;/i&gt; \'.$question.\'\n    &lt;br /&gt;\n    &lt;i&gt;I replied:\';\n  if (empty($answerq)) { \n    echo \'Sorry, I dont know the answer\';\n  }\n  echo \'&lt;/i&gt;\'.$answerq.\' \'.$ask.;\n  exit;\n}\necho \'&lt;/table&gt;\';\n$h-&gt;endpage();\n?&gt;\n']",False

In that function, there are several steps, and each step needs to allocate some memory with the size depending on the calculation results in previous steps (so I can't allocate them all at the beginning of the function). The pseudo code looks like: The above way to handle malloc failures is so ugly. Thus, I do it in the following way: Although I believe it's more brief, clear, and beautiful now, my team mate is still strongly against the use of 'goto'.

Details I noticed that the profile must have been recently displayed for GP instantly displays the page. By closing and opening the browser, the profile must be displayed again for GP instantly displays the page. Investigation So at first I thought Twitter could use a serverside session variable to store data. Then I discovered a use of localStorage in the Twitter source code. I confess, DOM storage is unfamiliar to me and the Twitter JavaScript code is unreadable. So I don't sure they use localStorage to store the profile.

1248583,Address search in MySQL table,I have table that contains five million addresses as strings. There is a user interface that allows you to search by address and it is implemented in the simplest possible way - using the syntax with wildcards at the both ends of the searched string. However this approach is really slow (especially when search result has to be sorted by some criteria). I thought of using fulltext search as it would be much faster but it limits users and I dont want it since most search queries contain just part of word. Addresses also can be abbreviated. What can I do? How could I implement the address search to be more efficient but without sacrificing much of the user experience. Edit Ive just read that I can actually use a wildcard at the end of the string when performing fulltext search. So if i store the reversed address maybe I can do prefix wildcard fulltext search. But will it be faster and how much? Are there some benchmarks? I couldn find one.,"['LIKE', 'match against']",True

1255484,Running an SQL query into a gridview for a table with 55 million row.,"Here's my problem: I built a small ASP.Net site to display some data from one of our internal databases. I have it set that the Query runs on a button click and takes into account parameters entered into 4 different text boxes.

If I take off the limiter I'm constantly getting overflow and memory errors. I'm not surprised, but I was wondering if there was a way to fix this.

The airline industry group IATA specifies file layout standards for transmitting schedules between systems, and a 'SSIM' file contains information about the schedule, and all its corresponding flights for one or multiple airlines. I have designed a Schedule object which contains a collection of Flight objects. There are usually between 2,000 - 20,000 flights in the input file, - the resulting object would be up to about 50MB in size. So far, I read in the flat file, and create the resulting Schedule object, which is then analysed/manipulated for reporting purposes. My question is - is it OK from a design perspective to do this ie. have the app keep all the Flights and Schedule objects in memory while I report on it? An alternative would be to keep the flight objects serialized on disk, and only work on the active records in memory while I need them. This would reduce the size of utilised memory, but is obviously more of a hassle from a coding perspective. I know there's no 'standard' approach to this, but am wondering what people's view on managing a very large object in memory is ie. is this pretty standard or is it suboptimal design? My preference is to keep everything in memory, and work on the object without resorting to serialization. Thanks guys Pete",[],False

1584534,SharePoint as an alternative to large volumes of file shares? Dreaming?,"We've been on SharePoint 2007 for close to 2 years now. We find it's a great CMS that helps us centralize project documents and colaborate with less duplication and confusion. The custom list feature offers a quick and dirty alternative to custom form and developed sql solutions sometimes. That said, we still have over 100 Terrabytes of files shares with documents dating far back to the beginning of time outside of SharePoint. As we look forward to smarter, faster and bigger Network FileSystems... (1)What realistic role should SharePoint play? (2) How reliable can SharePoint be as a seemless place to store documents? I mean, will we be able to save/retrieve documents to sharepoint from all popular clients without having to open sharepoint? Part of why I ask ... A few months ago as part of another project, we attempted to use SharePoint 2007 like a file share.. attempting to set up a Windows drive map and UNC path and/or WebDAV. Our findings were that not every client (XP, Vista, 7, Mac. IX, etc) plays nice with UNC, WEBDAV and drive mappings. Not surprised. Does this change significantly looking ahead to future sharepoint releases? (3) Are there documents that have no business in SharePoint? Databases? Executables? propietary logs? What about documents where we expect lots for row level IO from potentially multiple users? (4) How many customers would you say are seriously looking at SharePoint as a significant alternative to file shares? I understand SharePoint DBs should not exceed 100g - so we have a DB for every site collection. But we have over 100T of potential content. If there are customers seriously looking to go this way - what might there archetecture look like? Blob storage outside of SQL? EBS vs RBS? Who are the major players that offer this and will SharePoint ever offer this natively? EMC? StoragePoint? who else? EBS vs RBS? (5) What about performance and content indexing concerns?

I have read this Java code instead: Sometimes, when you don't have a variable but it is a more complex expression instead, just because of this issue, you need a dummy variable in Java: (Common thing is that is . And there you see that you also cannot really call that just twice. You really need the dummy variable.)

1760211,SQLAlchemy - how to map against a read-only (or calculated) property,"I'm trying to figure out how to map against a simple read-only property and have that property fire when I save to the database. A contrived example should make this more clear. First, a simple table: What I want to do is set up a class with a read-only property that will insert into the calculated_value column for me when I call session.commit()... According to the sqlalchemy docs, I think I am supposed to map this like so: The problem with this is that _calculated_value is None until you access the calculated_value property. It appears that SQLAlchemy is not calling the property on insertion into the database, so I'm getting a None value instead. What is the correct way to map this so that the result of the ""calculated_value"" property is inserted into the foo table's ""calculated_value"" column? OK - I am editing this post in case someone else has the same question. What I ended up doing was using a MapperExtension. Let me give you a better example along with usage of the extension: And this is how you use this. Lets say you have a class with several read only properties that must fire before insertion into the database. I am assuming here that for each one of these read only properties, you have a corresponding column in the database that you want populated with the value of the property.

I've been trying to do this for years, which may have resulted in a bit of a mess, but I wouldn't know because I understand very little of what's going on. There are two computers: Michał (with XP) and Matka (with 7). What I see on Michał is this. In Microsoft Windows Network there are three icons: Home, Mshome and Workgroup. Home has an icon of the router in it. Mshome has an icon of Michał in it, and there various shared folders. Workgroup has an icon of Matka in it, which, when I click it, shows me this: The only user anybody is using on Matka is called Zojka1, and there is no password. But it won't accept an empty password. What I see on Matka is this. I go to Network, and there are three computers listed there: Matka, Michał and Netiaspotdrive. Netia Spot is the name of my router. I don't know why this is listed as a computer. Michał has all the shared folders in it -- it's fine. Matka has one icon in it, called Users. In preferences, it is set as shared with ""all"".

When the user click on the child element in the tree I need to display the selected items detail information on the right hand side. It takes couple of seconds to load and display the data on right hand side. This works just fine, if the user is using mouse to select an item on the tree view. If the user were to use arrow key to navigate to an item in the tree as the user move form one item to another, it fires the selected item and each one will end up loading data from the database and populate, which in turn slow down user navigation experience. Is there a pattern available to handle this situation in Silverlight? For example, don't trigger selected item until unless the selected item does not change for couple of seconds etc.,?",[],False

1890026,NSMutableDictionary Singleton issue,"I am coding Objective-C using the Cocos2D framework, and I have a singleton used for multiple purposes. One new purposes is to get and set character's ""states"" which are strings.

I'm just leaving in the character state stuff: .h .m It's unclear to me what exactly the issue is when it freezes. When this happens, all I get in the console is: Which I'm sure doesn't help finding the issue.

1896704,What is the best way to switch off unused wireless keyboard in the range of working receiver?,"I recently bought a Logitech Wireless Keyboard and mouse with unified receiver (Logitech Wireless Combo MK220). I did not like wireless keyboard, so I use PS2 keyboard + wireless mouse. No wireless device has any switchers or power lights. Now I am in doubt: while I am using wireless mouse and ""not using"" wireless keyboard, is the latter discharging its power count-downing its life-time? Should I remove batteries or just keep the wireless mouse out of receiver range? Is it possible to switch off the keyboard (or mouse) without removing batteries?

1897999,ASP.NET MVC Session,"I've been reading PRO ASP.NET MVC2 by Steven Sanderson and I still can't figure out something about session. In the book he tells how to develop a Cart based on session using a Custom model binder for session persisting. Everything works fine but I can't figure out how it really works under the hood. Since it's a fair amount of code I'll write a simplified version Counter CounterController CounterCustomModelBinder Global.asax As you see there's a statement for fetching the session contents Counter counter = (Counter)controllerContext.HttpContext.Session[counterSessionKey]; But there's no statement for SAVING into session.

1906019,Critical sections with multicore processors,"With a single-core processor, where all your threads are run from the one single CPU, the idea of implementing a critical section using an atomic test-and-set operation on some mutex (or semaphore or etc) in memory seems straightforward enough; because your processor is executing a test-and-set from one spot in your program, it necessarily can't be doing one from another spot in your program disguised as some other thread. But what happens when you do actually have more than one physical processor? It seems that simple instruction level atomicity wouldn't be sufficient, b/c with two processors potentially executing their test-and-set operations at the same time, what you really need to maintain atomicity on is access to the shared memory location of the mutex. (And if the shared memory location is loaded into cache, there's the whole cache consistency thing to deal with, too..) This seems like it would incur far more overhead than the single core case, so here's the meat of the question: How much worse is it? Is it worse? Do we just live with it? Or sidestep it by enforcing a policy that all threads within a process group have to live on the same physical core?",[],False
1908668,Holomorphic Automorphism Group,"By a domain I mean an open connected subset of ${\mathbb C}$. If $D$ is a domain, let $\operatorname{Aut}(D)$ denote the collection of holomorphic bijections $f:D\to D$. It is well-known that if $f$ is holomorphic, so is its inverse, so $\operatorname{Aut}(D)$ is actually a group. We can give a topology to $H(D)$, the set of holomorphic maps with domain $D$, by setting $f_n\to f$ iff $f_n$ converges uniformly to $f$ on any compact subset of $D$. This actually makes $H(D)$ a complete metric space (Section 2.2 of Berenstein-Gay ""Complex variables""). I have a few questions about $\operatorname{Aut}(D)$ with this topology. First, Is $\operatorname{Aut}(D)$ a topological group? It is easy to check that $f_n\circ g_n\to f\circ g$ if $f_n\to f$ and $g_n\to g$ in $H(D)$, so the question here is whether $f_n^{-1}\to f^{-1}$ if $f_n\to f$, and $f_n,f\in \operatorname{Aut}(D)$. (This may be trivial.) Second, If $f_n\to f$ in $H(D)$ and $f_n\in \operatorname{Aut}(D)$ for all $n$, is $f\in \operatorname{Aut}(D)$ as well? Are there any reasonable assumptions on $D$ that make this true? (As pointed out in the comments below, if $D$ is simply connected, then $f$ needs not be injective.) By Rouche, we have that $f$ is either constant or injective (Prop 2.6.19 in Berenstein-Gay ""Complex Variables""). Perhaps, if it is injective, showing it is surjective should be easy? Finally, I've heard that $\operatorname{Aut}(D)$ is actually a Lie group. I suppose the topology is the one I mentioned, but I do not see where the manifold structure will come from if that's the case. Could you sketch why this is so, or point me in the right direction if I'm completely off the mark here?",[],False

If I write: instead of being immediate, it basically never returns as do other queries written against this view.

It seems like MySQL is creating the entire aggregated data set (queries within the view) for the view before applying any filtration criteria. This is insane.

1921136,Why doesn't WCF support other encodings than UTF-8 and UTF-16 by default?,"We have some issues with a WCF SOAP service that we publish, and is consumed by one of our customers. The issue is that the customer makes SOAP requests encoded as ISO-8859-1, which results in the error message: HTTP/1.1 415 Cannot process the message because the content type 'text/xml;charset=iso-8859-1' was not the expected type 'text/xml; charset=utf-8'. Apparently, WCF only supports UTF-8 and UTF-16 big endian, according to http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms751486(v=VS.90).aspx. The problem is also discussed in these questions on SO: Calling a webservice that uses ISO-8859-1 encoding from WCF WCF Exception: Text Message Encoding and ISO-8859-1 Encoding While I agree that unicode is preferred, I'm not in a position to force our customer to change their client, so I will have to fix our service. 150 lines of code written by some MSDN author into my project - I can't maintain that code or take responsibility for it. I've also spent quite some time to Google for solutions and try to understand them, which I feel is a waste of time for something that could be handled out of the box by WCF. My question is: is there any good reason for Microsoft to implement WCF this way? Is there a technical reason why SOAP shouldn't use ISO-8859-1? To me, this seems to break Postel's law, rejecting messages that can really be handled by almost any XML parser out there.",[],False

Actually support isn't the word; Content Management Systems seem to actively work against efforts to allow for clean staging. Currently I am using Drupal. I have had a very hard time finding how the community solves this problem. Most of the posts I've seen recommend reproducing the steps done in development on the production system (reading this actually shortened my life a small bit). I also hear of pushing production data back to the developers so they can add incremental features. This can't be the way to go, what if the client doesn't want you pulling their data back to your development environment? So finally my question: How are you managing real world production staging issues for a CMS?

My function works correctly when there is only one user for a type. However, when there is more than one user, 'undefined' is stored in the names field.

2036257,A better way to mark location on a map,"I'm making an iOS app, where I want users to mark locations on a regular basis on a map. The default way to mark location in iOS is to drop a pin either at the center of the map or where the user holds a touch (using the gesture recognizer). Then to mark the pin to the desired location ACCURATELY, the user holds the pin and can drop it again. If you have done this on an iOS maps app, you will know it is hard to mark a location ACCURATELY, in this manner. It looks cool, but takes some trial and error in my opinion. If I can help it, I want to make this process smoother and more obvious is my app. So is there any other way for the user to mark a location on a map, without doing the default pin drag-drop?

There are a huge number of directories and subdirectories and i basically want to clean up all of the subversion .svn folders before i attempt to import to a new repository and i dont want svn to get confused. is there anyway to clean out a directory structure to remove all svn references?,[],False

2067344,Can it be useful to build an application starting with the GUI?,"The trend in application design and development seems to be starting with the ""guts"": the domain, then data access, then infrastructure, etc. The GUI seems to usually come later in the process. I wonder if it could ever be useful to build the GUI first... My rationale is that by building at least a prototype GUI, you gain a better idea of what needs to happen behind the scenes, and so are in a better position to start work on the domain and supporting code. I can see an issue with this practice in that if the supporting code is not yet written, there won't be much for the GUI layer to actually do. Perhaps building mock objects or throwaway classes (somewhat like is done in unit testing) would provide just enough of a foundation to build the GUI on initially. Might this be a feasible idea for a real project? Maybe we could add GDD (GUI Driven Development) to the acronym stable...",[],False
2067990,JQuery Ajax Upload File - Selectors not working in Mozilla,"I have created an ajax upload file and i am have some simple problems, I have callbacks that allow you to check the file size, file format, progress, when the upload finished and starts.

2078188,Better algorithm for estimating download time,"Possible Duplicate: Estimating/forecasting download completion time We've all seen the download time running estimate that initially says something like ""7 days"", but keeps dropping wildly (e.g. ""23 hours"", ""45 minutes"", ""1 min. 50 sec"", etc) with each successive estimation as the chunks are downloaded. To avoid these initial (alarming) estimates, there are techniques one could try like suppressing display of the first n estimates, or waiting for the delta between estimates to drop below some threshold before you start displaying them, but these don't seem like a general, robust solution. There are corner cases involving too few samples, or samples that actually are wildly varying... I think I recall a general solution for this kind of thing in mathematics (statistics?) that reduced or eliminated these wild values. Does anyone know?

2110579,"Trying to get tooltips within a chrome extension overlay, but failing. Is this even possible?","I'm trying to get simple tooltips working in a button-triggered chrome extension overlay. Stated alternatively, I want my user to be able to click my chrome extension's button, then hover over links that appear in the resulting overlay to produce simple tooltips. This seems easy, right? But I've run into 3 dead ends now and have started to wonder if this is even possible: I tried the Jquery Tooltip plugin. It produces an effect, but not what you'd expect. Instead of creating another overlay under the link, it actually extended the extension's overlay size and put the tooltip at the bottom. It's as if the plugin said ""The overlay is already open, let me add to it."" Second, I tried simpletip. Again, it produced an effect, but not the desired one. The link div (which is supposed to have the tooltip) included the tooltip within the div at page load and when moused-over, just produced a larger font. At no point did a second overlay appear. (For #s 1 and 2, the important thing to note is (a) they failed and (b) they never produced an overlay on top of the extension overlay, leading me to suspect that overlay + second overlay might not be possible.) I gave wz_tooltip a try since I'd used it in the past and found it stable. Unfortunately, wz documentation leans on in-line javascript onmouseover=""Tip()"" and onmouseout=""Untip()"" for its effects which is not allowed by chrome inside extensions. I'm sure there are probably ways to make these fire without inline JS, but that's not a battle I want to fight at the moment. I'd rather get an answer to the question first: Is it possible to have tooltips in a chrome extension overlay? i.e. Is an overlay on top of an overlay possible? If so, how did you accomplish it? Edit: Here's a crude but illustrative screenshot of what I'm trying to accomplish:",[],False

I'm an ignorant on DNS so please forgive my misknowledge. First I may mention the goal of this operation: I use Virtualmin on my server, and its API which, when adding a domain, creates all the DNS records (in BIND 9.7) according to templates I configured.This includes SPF, and as I have spam problems, my server being often registered as spammer, I think it might contribute to solve the problem, and also avoid any manual work in GoDaddy's interface when taking care of a new domain. In GoDaddy interface, which manages this domain, I add two hosts called ns1.xxx.co and ns2.xxx.co pointing to my server's IP as described here. Then I configure the zone on my server: At this point, I wonder if this domain xxx.co can use its own domain-based nameservers or if it has to stick with the ones from GoDaddy. I tried both. So I use a second domain example.com, add it on my server through Virtualmin, and I set GoDaddy's as secondary/slave for example.com.

Let's say I create a great SL application and host it on my web page. If someone downloads th XAP he can host it on his web page since it's just a file and it will work perfectly fine I think, even if its obfuscated. I think there are couple of ways to protect it: Use authorization on my website (ASP.NET auth) and pass an auth token from it to the SL app so they at least will have to use my website to get th auth token in some way (although if not 2nd this could also be done in some unseen way, like webrequest or something to do everything a person would do to obtain th token &amp; then it would again work on other domain just fine) and use WCF service operations with auth this auth token. Use some WCF service &amp; cross domain restrictions to make sure XAP won't work good if hosted like that. Looks like if second is valid 100% protected solution there is no need to make complicated auth on web site and pass token to Silverlight, and just SL authentication can be fine. I would like to hear your thoughts about both approaches, and maybe some other ways to help this situation.

EDIT: We've experimented with the audio and we've discovered that wearing ear buds or headphones on the mobile device makes the problem appear to disappear. Obviously something is incorrect with the recorded audio (stereo) where the mobile phones, via their speakers, are expecting mono. Is forcing stereo to mono during the conversion process causing the problem? More research ensues. I am stumped and have banged my head against the wall for 2 days now trying to figure this out. We posted a video on our companies website that works well on all devices except for mobile phone devices including iPhone and Samsung. On those devices the video will play, but the audio is garbled beyond use.

The results are the same - works well on all devices save for phones. I have also exported the video to YouTube using iMovie and still I have the same results. The kicker? The other two videos on our YouTube channel and on our website play just fine on every device. There was no difference in the way that I output or converted or uploaded those files.

The values $a,b,p$ are parameters $\omega(t)$ looks like the blue function here with $\omega$ as such, $y(t)$ should be two chirps -- a sine wave whose frequency sweeps. My intuition is that the two chirps should be identical, but they're not. The second chirp is higher in frequency. The argument to $\sin$ , the quantity $2 \cdot \pi \cdot t \cdot \omega(t)$ looks like the blue function here: Two piecewise quadratics. The second quadratic should just be a shifted version of the first one, which is what is depicted in red. I can't argue with the math, but there is something very simple wrong with my intuition.

2340557,Force GAC installation before running .NET custom action?,"I'm using a VS 2008 Setup and Deployment project to deploy a mixed managed / unmanaged application. I've had trouble registering mixed-mode DLL's using the built-in registration property (""vsdraCOM"" enumerated value of the ""Register"" property.) As a workaround, I've added a .NET custom install assembly (with a class that derives from System.Configuration.Install.Installer.) I'm certain that that class is running and a number of operations successfully install and uninstall through code in that assembly, including executing the Dll(Un)RegisterServer entry point of a number of assemblies. However, one DLL is not successfully registering. It is the only DLL that depends on some 3rd-party redistributable assemblies that want to be installed to the GAC. I have those assemblies installed to the GAC thanks to the built-in support for that in VS 2008's setup and deployment projects, and I know that is working. I've confirmed that what is happening is that the custom action is executing before the installer executes the GAC installation. Whew. So my question is, is there a way to force the installer to execute the GAC installation before executing the custom action? Is there a way to use the ""Condition"" property of the custom action to do this? If not, what's my best alternative? Capturing the registry entries from the DLL and adding them to the registry settings for the installer (don't like this because someone may add new COM servers to the class in the future)? Using .NET code to install the assembly into the GAC manually (don't know how to do that yet)? Thanks, Dave",[],False

2469251,Using OpenID how do you handle 2 accounts with the same nick,"If I want to provide OpenID as the only registration method available AND want to do something meaningful with the nick name, how can I handle 2 users with the same Jon Smith nickname? Actually, when I looked at StackOverflow's URL schema I was surprised that the internal user ID was being used in the URL. For example: http://stackoverflow.com/users/5908/z225rate Now I realize it's probably to avoid this problem. But this also opens a tricky scenario. What if users wants to impersonate someone else? They just need to create a fake OpenID account, copy the nick and there you go. Sure you can tell who's who looking at the OpenID url, but it's quite likely going to cause confusion among non-experienced users. I was thinking about checking the nick during registration and forcing the user to pick up another one in case it was already in use. But then you have to keep the new nick and use it instead of the one set up in OpenID. Not nice. Any ideas? ""Don't use OpenID"" is not a (valid) idea : ) I mean, it might well be that I end up not using it, but want to know how far would I have to go to make it work ""properly"". Thanks!",[],False
2473395,Cron job in Ubuntu,"This should be pretty straight forward but I can't seem to get getting it working despite reading several tutorials via Google, Stackoverflow and the man page. I created a cron to run every 1 min (for testing) and all it basically does is spit out the date. The cron-test file is: Waiting many minutes and I never see a test.log file. I can call the ""test.sh"" manually and get it to output &amp; append. I'm wondering what I'm missing? I'm also doing this as root. I wonder if I'm miss-understanding something about root's location? Is my path messed up because it's appending some kind of home directory to it? Thanks! UPDATE ----------------- It does appear that I'm not following something with the directory path. If I change directory to root's home directory: I see my output file ""test.log"" with all the dates printed out every minute. So, I will update my question to be, what am I miss-understanding about the /path? Is there a term I need to use to have it start from the root directory? Cheers! UPDATE 2 ----------------- Ok, so I got what I was missing. The script to setup crontab was working right. It was finding the file relative to the root directory. ie: But the ""cron-test.sh"" file was not set relative to the root directory. Thus, when ""root"" ran the script, it dumped it back into ""root's"" home directory. My thinking was that since the script was being run in ""/var/test/"" that the file would also be dumped in ""/var/test/"". Instead, I need to set the location in the script file to dump it out correctly. And that works.","['crontab -l\n* * * * * /var/test/cron-test.sh\n', 'echo ""$(date): cron job run"" &gt;&gt; test.log\n', '# cd\n', '* * * * * /var/test/cron-test.sh\n', 'echo ""$(date): cron job run"" &gt;&gt; /var/test/test.log\n']",False

2492294,MySQL query to choose top camera choices based on multiple column values,"Okay so I am trying to get some ideas on how to go about determining the top choices of camera I have from the table setup below. This is not a real scenario I am just trying to figure out the best way or some way to go about doing this. So the camera table has entries id(INT) which is unique, name(VARCHAR), reviewRank(INT), price(INT), and failRate(INT). Here is an example of the TABLE setup and inserts code: Criteria is that a higher reviewRank is better, a lower price is better, and a lower failRate is better. And if multiple cameras share the best value for one of the columns then we choose the one with the best values in the other two columns or if multiple cameras have the same values in multiple columns such as CAMERA(3,'Camera 3',1,10,99) and CAMERA(4,'Camera 4',1,10,6) do then the last column determines the outcome. Basically any camera with the best value in any of the three columns automatically becomes a candidate for the list of top cameras to choose from. But if multiple cameras have the best value for the same column then we need to determine which is the best of these by looking at the values of the other columns. So using the database state above the query would return cameras (1,'Camera 1',5,100,1) and (4,'Camera 4',1,10,6) since camera id 1 has the highest reviewRank and lowest failRate and camera id 4 and camera id 3 tie for having the lowest price but camera id 4 has a lower failRate than camera id 3. So basically I am trying to figure a way to go about finding the top choices where there are multiple column comparisons using MySQL preferably using a single query if possible. My initial thoughts were something like this However this is obviously wrong since it does not cover all of the possible permutations.

If error is clicked show error.php only(right after downloads.php) and don't remove downloads.php or any other external file that may or may not be included on the main page already. Any suggestions? :/) so I can promise I've done my homework. p.s.s. If you think this deserves a down vote please be kind enough to explain why. I'm open to criticism but just thumbs down is not helpful at all.

The photo will be quite big on their profile page - 640x360px which translates to 16:9 ratio which seems to be the standard image size from a digital camera. I haven't done this before (bit of a noob) and there's a couple of things I don't know whats the best way to handle. So I want an 'upload image' button which causes a popup which allows the user to resize or crop the image they're uploading so if fits nicely into a 640x360px div. But if the image they're uploading is, for example, 16:16 ratio and 5000px wide, then obviously it needs to be resized before being shown to the user where he can then crop the image to fit into my required 16:9 ratio. Equally if the image the user wants to use it tiny I want to encourage them to scale their picture up so if fits nicely into the div I want it in.

2802912,Firefox Box Shadow redraw when transforming & transitioning,"I have an image with a box shadow applied. I then use CSS3 to transition and transform it so it fades up, moves across the screen and rotates... except in Firefox 14.01 it doesn't work. It breaks up during the transition to a sort of venetian blind effect. In Chrome it works perfectly. I have set it up at http://jsfiddle.net/hillyhilly/yeaZF/1/ which moves it less (hover the image) and that gets closer to the problem. The box sort of redraws smaller as it starts to move and then redraws properly at the end. If you increase the offsets on hover you can see more like the venetian blind effect I'm seeing. Anyone know what's going on? Am I doing something dumb (likely) or am I simply trying to make too much happen at the same time? Any ideas for workarounds (I've tried everything I can think of).

2836144,Concurrency issues using DbContext.Database.Connection.CreateCommand,"I'm gonna try to explain this without actually mucking through the whole design of the application I'm working on. Cause who cares about that. If it's pertinent, I can give more detail but I think I cover everything below. main problem: I've got a few stored procedures that I need to execute periodically. I get the proc names from a database table, so my application has no hard coded knowledge of them. This is by design. I'm currently using the entity framework to do all my data access. My application is multi threaded -- I grab all the procs that I need to run, then iterate through each one, grab its properties from my configuration tables and queue it up to run on a separate thread in the app's thread pool. I'm using the Database.Connection.CreateCommand method and executing the procs -- pulling the data into a data table. This works out well when I'm only executing one proc, but when Problem is that I run into concurrency issues. The specific exception I'm getting is System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException: New transaction is not allowed because there are other threads running in the session. I'm assuming this is because I'm trying to execute my procedure while also accessing the properties of another procedure via the entity framework. Potential solutions / trains of thought that occur to me: I can get this to work just fine using the DbContext.Database.SqlQuery method if I write a model class that has the fields I need. But what if I don't want to write a model class at all? Is there a way I can do this and let the entity framework actually handle the query? I could grab all of the properties before i start executing any procs. That would probably work fine. If I define my properties as ICollections on the model that tells me what procedure to run, is there a way to force them to load when I select said model from the DB instead of when I iterate through them later to read them?",[],False

I've already upgraded the RAM to 512 MB, and am probably going to invest in a PCI USB2 card and 100baseT Network card, but with a 400 MHz Pentium 2, it seems like any operation is going to take forever, backups especially, and the fact that I'm using PATA isn't going to help. Is this computer simply too old and won't handle these functions, or can it pull it off? Is there another product that does the same thing and is not expensive? Should I consider RAID, multi-disk partitions, or other forms of internal redundancy? Is a SCSI or SATA controller + drives worth the cost?",[],False

3049943,Get parameter name/value using rs:StoredParametersID key?,"I'm working with SSRS 2008 R2 with the ReportService2010 soap endpoint with the ReportExecutionService. For parameters that have large values, SSRS has some smarts to automatically tokenize a drill-down report URL (summed up nicely in this thread): The problem is related to the RS System Property StoredParametersThreshold. This value (defaults to 1500) determine the number of characters a URL can contain before SSRS replaces that URL with a token. The reason for this functionality is that some browsers/servers limit the URL length of a URL. Since report parameter value combinations can be really long, we try to be smart and tokenize the URL so that the URLs will work. A possible work around is to increase the value of StoredParametersThreshold. The URL (decoded for easier viewing) looks something like this: The problem is, in my custom viewer, I cannot use these tokenized URLs and need to retrieve the actual parameter name/value so that I may execute the drill-down report.

I can't disclose the real details of my project but here is an approximation which illustrates the issue/question. Answers in either VB or C# are appreciated! I have several different products with widely varying properties yet all of them need to be represented in a catalog. Each product class has a corresponding table in my database. A catalog entry has a handful of properties specific to being a catalog entry and consequently have their own table. I have defined an interface for the catalog entries with the intent that calling the DescriptionText property will give me very different results based on the underlying concrete type. Given that the DescriptionText is a presentation layer concern I don't want to implement the ICatalogEntry interface in my product classes. Instead I want to delegate that to some kind of formatter. In a controller somewhere there will be code like this: In a view somewhere there will be code like this: So the question is what do the constructors look like? How to set it up so the appropriate objects are instantiated in the right places. Seems like generics or maybe DI can help with this but I seem to be having a mental block. The only idea I've come up with is to add a ProductType property to ICatalogEntry and then implement a factory like this: IMHO, I am not really getting any smells off this code other than having to change the factory for every new product class that comes along.

3112815,Documentation As-A-Manual vs. Documentation As-A-Checklist,"I've had discussions in the past with other people in my department about documentation, specifically, level-of-detail and requirements. In their view, documentation is a simple checklist of Y things to do when X things go wrong. I disagree. I think that this presumes that all issues in IT can easily be boiled down to simple checklists of recovery procedures. I think that it completely ignores the complexity of the situation, and as the other people in the department don't always have a depth of understanding about the issue (which is why I'm writing the document - so they have something to refer to) that the documentation should include some basic background material, such as: Purpose of the (sub)system in question Why it is configured in that manner Expectations of events to occur when the settings/procedures are implemented Potential issues that can cause procedures to fail However, I'm rather outvoted on this, so my documentation is required to be re-written into a form that says ""Steps A-B-C applied in order will resolve problem X"". I often hear the lament that it needs to fit onto a single page of paper. Try explaining the configuration of Squid ACLs to someone in this manner, including troubleshooting, through a single-page document. That's just one of a half-dozen documents that are ""waiting to be written"" as recovery checklists. Is the method I'm advocating really going overboard? Or are they right, and I should just mind my business here and just write them a simple checklist? My concern is that, no matter how well you write a procedure checklist, it really doesn't solve an issue that requires a SysAdmin to think things through. If you're spending time doing a checklist of recovery procedures that ends up not resolving the issue (because there are additional factors that aren't a part of the document, due to the narrow focus of the document), and the purpose of the document was to avoid re-reading man pages and wikis and websites all over again, then why am I going through the motions? Am I just worrying too much, or is this a real issue? EDIT: There currently is no helpdesk position in the department. The audience for the documentation would be for the other admins or for the department head.",[],False

Please, don't stop reading :) I'm showing you some of me code, which contains some blackberry specific stuff, but you should see what I'm doing.

My Problem here is, that I want to use the controller to change UI Elements, like Displaying a PopUp Box, hide someting or other things. But all these UI Elements are defined in the View (here ContactManagerMainScreen) so have to give to the Controller a reference to the View. Which leads to my co-depending objects misery. I cannot create the controller before the view is declared. Without the requirement to allow the controller to change UIElements, it would be no problem (as shown in the Graphics).

They way I did it was to set a PHP session variable when they check the box. Then for all the php webpages my code checks to make sure the ""I am 21"" session variable is set. So this works for any php webpages I want to block. But the drawbacks are that I have to add the age block php snippet to the top of each php file and it can't work for any non php files. So my question is, is there anyway I can use the ""I am 21"" session variable to simply block/allow access to an entire directory? So that I don't have to put the age block in each PHP file and so that I can block something that isn't a PHP file, like for example a PDF.

This differs from a lot of other UI systems in not allowing a view to be shared. Could someone confirm if this is the case? I have an ad view (yeah I don't like ads either), which needs to appear in two separate list views. How can both list views include this common ad view? (the ad view is maintained by the activity and not by the list adapters). When I add to one it is removed from the other because if I do an add it says it can only have one parent. So I remove the parent which happens to be the holder in the other list view. So the ad ends up appearing in only one list at a time. But more generally how can two separate views each contain another view which is common to both? Just for simplification if I have two views, v1 and v2 and there is a third view v3 which is a FrameLayout containing an image and text. How should I reference this v3 from v1, and v2. Do I just do an include of v3 in v1 and v3? Its a particular instance of V3 that I want both to point to?

How do I set it within the adapters of the list views. If I add it I get issues about View must not have more than one parent. When I try to just get a reference to the View within the row item. How can I set the ViewHolder value in my adapter to this common view Instance? I am managing the ad within my activity, and not in the ListAdapters so I wanted to share the Activity managed view within two separate lists that each have their own adapter. BTW, the other thing I tried beside adding the adding the adView in was was to try to get a reference to myAdInclude within the adapter but this returned as null. Still I would need to really set the value somehow ......

Is there an appropriate response code for this condition or do I just need to give in and do 400?",[],False

3258407,"zebra printing on ICS, intents and license","We are developing a new App for internal use that will rely on a RW420 Zebra printer for POS printing. I have been looking for documentation on the issue and I still have three questions I have not been able to resolve: a) Pricing: Is there any amount to pay for using the SDK on a commercial app?. We are developing it on behalf of our final client. I have been able to download the SDK from their page at no cost but still have concerns over it. b) ICS support: It seems the SDK has not been evolved since 2.1/2.2 Android releases. Will this be an issue?. Currently it is possible to use the Zebra App under ICS, but don't want to go deeper on programming just to see all the efforts have been futile. c) Do I really need the SDK or is it possible to use an intent (found nothing about it)? If you have another similar printer suggestion to substitute the Zebra, I will be delighted to know about it.",[],False

3259915,Cassandra: What is a subcolumn,"http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/CassandraLimitations Quote: Cassandra has two levels of indexes: key and column. But in super columnfamilies there is a third level of subcolumns; these are not indexed, and any request for a subcolumn deserializes all the subcolumns in that supercolumn. So you want to avoid a data model that requires large numbers of subcolumns. What is exactly the subcolumn? It's interesting, googling the term does nor really yield in results. I know the concepts of supercolumn, but its not really clear what exactly the term ""subcolumn"" refers to (how it is defined): What concept is correct? First: OR Second: Furthermore, what is what in the Definitions: Its only a matter of definition. Thanks Markus","['ROW-KEY\n   SubCol     SubCol    \n    col  col  col val\n    val  val  col val\n', 'ROW-KEY\n   Column           Column\n    SubCol SubCol   SubCol SubCol\n    val    val      val    val\n', 'comparator = UTF8Type and\nsubcomparator = UTF8Type and \n']",False
3260242,Batch View updates,"I want to load a bunch of view definitions into SQL Server 2005 &amp; 2008. I am using IF/ELSE logic to dynamically building Create or Alter statements that I then EXEC. This works fine. However, unless I get the order of the statements correct, I get errors if a view is dependent on another view that would be created in a later statement. Is there a way to turn of the valiation of the SQL statements until after they have all been entered? It seems like the worst of both worlds. SQL Server does late binding and so it won't propogate changes to tables and views, but you can't create a view without all the pieces being in place.",[],False

3288876,Python import error undefined symbol: Py_InitModule4 on executing my script,"I am working on C extension of python where this extension C module will make a Remote Procedure Call(RPC) to access the network services. This C module will apply the method Py_BuildValue on the result (collected information) of RPC and append that to a list using PyList_Append method.Finally this list object returns to the calling Python script. We are converting this C module to the form of shared .so file to use with Python. To solve some memory leak issue I modified the code in such a way that instead of directly appending the Py_BuildValue on RPC result to the list, I assign this Py_BuildValue result to a PyObject variable and append that variable to the list. After appending the variable to the list decrements the reference count for this PyObject variable using Py_DECREF. After this change when I execute the Python script on one machine I got the following error. ImportError: /usr/local/support/iadrpcmodule.so: undefined symbol: Py_InitModule4 But I am not using the variable 'Py_InitModule4' in my C module where I am using only Py_InitModule3. I compiled the code using python 2.4 and executed it on a 64 bit linux machine. Again the interesting part is when I restarted the machine the issue disappeared..!!. I am not getting this issue when I tried on another machine. I saw as per PEP0353 (http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0353/ ) there is a name change for 64 bit machines in the case of Python 2.5 and to prevent loading extension modules that assume a 32-bit size type into an interpreter that has a 64 bit size type, Py_InitModule4 is renamed to Py_InitModule4_64. What may be the reason to get such an issue and how it can be resolved on restarting the machine ? is that because of my code change to fix memory leak issue and do I need any code change to be done to solve this 'import error' ? As I am not using Py_InitModule4 in my code how I can make the change of renaming it as Py_InitModule4_64 to work with 64 bit machine ? Previous code where I applied some fixes is something similar as follows I changed the code something similar as follows to solve some memory leak issue. Also another function to initialize the module is there as follows where we are using Py_InitModule3 This code is compiled using Python 2.4 and will be running on any 64 bit machine. The executing machine may have both Python 2.4 and Python 2.5.

3445615,Solving a nonlinear system using Groebner basis computations,"I have discovered that Groebner basis computations may help in a problem I am working on. However, I am having some very specific problems. First, the literature I have discovered on Groebner basis calculations are either extremely advanced or sacrifice completeness for simplicity. Secondly, to come to grips with these methods I have tried working with computer algebra systems (specifically Macaulay 2, version 1.2) to wade through examples. Therein, my problem has a similar flavor to this post (I found the answers moderately helpful). One of the answers to this question provides an example of a computation that works out correctly - I cannot get Macaulay to behave the same way on a randomly selected toy problem. It is my understanding that Groebner basis methods are an infallible way to find solutions to nonlinear systems of equations over any field (barring some issues with numerical stability and computational complexity). That is, it is my understanding that Groebner basis computations will always reduce a system of equations to an equivalent system in which there exist polynomials of one variable (and that solving the system can proceed from finding roots to this one polynomial and then ""steamroll"" the rest). I believe I have followed the steps necessary to get a system of nonlinear equations into its Groebner basis form. However, I do not see a clear means of finding solutions to my system. Here is my Macaulay 2 history. i29 : T = ZZ[f,g,h] o29 = T o29 : PolynomialRing i32 : Woot = gb ideal(f^2*g + g^2*h + 2*h^2, f + g + h, f^3*g^2*h) o32 = GroebnerBasis[status: done; S-pairs encountered up to degree 9] o32 : GroebnerBasis i33 : ideal gens Woot o33 = ideal ($f+g+h$, $g^3+3g^2h+g*h^2+2h^2$, $8g*h^5+4h^6-8h^5$, $5g^2h^4+2g*h^5+2g^2h^3+4h^5$, $4h^7+2g^2h^4+4g*h^5+24h^6-12g^2h^3+40h^5$, $g*h^6+g^2h^4+4g*h^5-2h^6+2g^2h^3-8h^5$, $g^2h^5+2g^2h^4+4g*h^5+4h^6$ None of these are univariate. (This particular system of equations is not important to me - I just used them as an example). Have I chosen a bad monomial ordering?

3465286,Prove that $f$ is a contraction.,"Suppose $f$ is analytic in a convex region $D$ and $|f&#39;|\le 1$ throughout $D$. Prove that $f$ is a contraction, that is, show that $|f(b)-f(a)|\le|b-a|$ for all $a,b$ in $D$. Since $f$ is analytic, it is differentiable in $D$. This seems like we would use the mean-value theorem, namely there exists $c$ such that $f&#39;(c)=(f(b)-f(a))/(b-a)$. Then we take the absolute value of both sides and $|f&#39;|&lt;1$. So $|f(b)-f(a)|&lt;|b-a|$, but I'm not sure if I can use the Mean Value Theorem applies, since we do not know if $f$ is real-valued. Also I haven't used that the region is convex. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!",[],False

3578501,Another benefit of Lighttpd in front of Apache,"I have read in a site that another benefit of having Lighttpd in front of Apache is lower number of child processes. Lighttpd will handle keep-alive and client requests while child processes of Apache gets to serve dynamic pages faster because of the very low latency communication between Lighttpd and Apache. I am trying to find the link but I am having a hard time. Given that I already have a dedicated Lighttpd server for my static contents (img, vid, css, js, html, etc.) and another dedicated Apache server for my dynamic pages (php), I would like to implement this technique if it really has some performance gain. 1) Has anybody put a Lighttpd in front of Apache for the same purpose as explained above? 2) Is there really a performance gain on this? How much? 3) What about the overhead of Lighttpd handling down the request to Apache, is it really worth it? Thanks!",[],False
3580030,"Slow internet data download using single connection, but fast using multiple","I recently moved in to a new apartment and the house owner is providing the internet. He has 16 Mbps connection from his ISP (Deutsche Telekom). I am only able to connect to his infrastructure via wireless. Whenever I am downloading any data from the internet, for example watching streamed video or downloading a file, the connection is very slow. Only about 50-100 KB/s. But, if I am using some special software, like jDownloader or BitTorrent, which is set to get the source file with multiple connections, the download speed increases and often even reaches the limit of 16 Mbps. For example, downloading latest NetBeans installer file, I get around 50 KB/s using Firefox (1 connection) and 500 KB/s or more using jDownloader (10 connections). What could be the cause of this slow single connections? Running a speed test on http://www.speedtest.net/ reports around 5.41 Mbps download and 0.90 Mbps upload with ping of 23. I can imagine that the ISP is reducing the speed for single connections.

3645948,Checking for emptiness of collections with (in)equalities - what's the best practice?,"For a long time now I've been in the habit of checking whether a collection (array, dictionary, whatever) is non-empty with a nonequality. Like this: Sometimes I do this for strings too, and other kinds of collections. In practice, this should be the same as Because the length of collection should never be less than 0 anyway, right? So I always thought - what the heck, I'll include the inequality and be double-safe even in the case the sky falls down. But today a though struck me that the second version might be more readable than the first. It expresses more clearly that the case I'm looking for is the empty array, which is not immediately apparent from the first version. So maybe I should use that instead? Since, you know, if a collection length is less than 0, then I'm screwed anyway. Which version do you use, and which would you suggest others to use (and why)? Clarification: This was meant as a question about simple collections, where obtaining is O(1) or otherwise inexpensive. If itself is a nontrivial operation (such as necessitating the iteration through a linked list, or contacting the DB), then this is the wrong approach altogether. The question was about vs where x is a nonnegative integer (although it might not be typed as such).","['if ( MyArray.Length &lt; 1 )\n{\n    // Do something if the array is empty\n}\n', 'if ( MyArray.Length == 0 )\n{\n    // Do something if the array is empty\n}\n', '.Length', '.Length', 'x &lt; 1', 'x == 0']",False

3653503,Why does s[n..-1] work in ruby?,"I'm fairly new to ruby. Recently, I wanted to extract a portion of a string from the n'th character of said string to the end. Doing something like s[n,(s.size - n)] seemed pretty inelegant to me, so I asked a couple of friends. One suggested I try s[n..-1], and sure enough that works, but he couldn't give me a good reason why it should work. I find the fact that it works rather puzzling, as the following output from irb1.9 should explain: So as you can see, the range object 2..-1 is empty -- it has no members, which is absolutely what you expect if you go upwards in value from 2 to -1. This is consistent with the documentation for how range objects should work. The documentation for indexing a string with a range clearly says: ""If given a range, a substring containing characters at offsets given by the range is returned"" -- but that is an empty set. I also can find no examples in ""The Ruby Programming Language"" or in the Ruby docs in which a string is indexed using or the like, and can find no examples of it in other official sources. It appears to be folklore, however, that it works even though nothing in the manuals indicate that you can index a string with a range this way, and get the result you get even though the range has no members. Yet, my friend was correct, it works. So, could someone please explain why this works to me? I'm also very much interested in knowing if the fact that it works is a fluke of MRI/YARV or if this is absolutely expected to work in all Ruby implementations, and if so, where is it documented to work? EDITED TO ADD: An answerer below claimed that only the range's and attributes matter for these purposes, but I can find no documentation of that in TRPL or in the Ruby documentation. The answer also claims that there are indeed examples of such ""mixed-sign"" range indexing, but the only one I could find was in a context where the mixed-range index was shown to produce , not a slice of a string. I therefore don't find that answer satisfying. EDITED TO ADD: It appears that the correct answer is that this is indeed a defect in the Ruby documentation.

These are the steps I'm taking at the moment: calculate the size of the large image (say 1000x1000) For each image in the array calculate the aspect ratio. (they are all different) find what % scale it needs (say 6% of total image) take the square root of the total image size / aspect ratio to find one dimension Multiply the side we know by the aspect ratio to get the other dimension. Scale the image down to the new calculated value (Now heres where im having trouble) Find a space on the larger image which will fit the scaled image in. If there are multiple choose one at random. Repeat until image is filled. There are around 4000 images which need to fit in. There are quite a lot of really small images (1x1, 2x1 2x2 etc) which are useful for filling. The problem is the random method and the first space method are not great and usually end up with some images that wont fit on.

3687936,Separation of concerns restyling a jquery-mobile site,"We've recently started a small-ish project for a mobile site demo w/.NET4; jquery-mobile has been sensibly chosen to be in charge of client-side functionality and UI interactions. Requested branding is to differ quite significantly from anything that can be built with a ThemeRoller as it goes beyond the basic color change; this is where (I think) I'm about to hit a dead end. It is currently my understanding that there is virtually no separation between element presentation and function on pretty much every interactive object, at least with the out-of-the-box library. Consider the following scenario: we have rounded off-gray gradient tabs that I, with my executive decision (yeah, right), want to make into neat solid pink square (not really, but this should make my question more engaging :) I'd normally add a css rule like .tab-container .tab {background-color:pink;} and be done with it; however given application of data-role attribute to the html element containing those tabs the following happens on the client at runtime (from the jquery-ui...js): …and, when rendered, I'll get my pink tabs but with all the styling that comes by default. Say, I really want those rounded corners gone; out of the box I have these options: add ""ui-corner-none"" class to the element - bad given that this would have to be manually done for every instance, and also for every property I want overridden making this approach unmaintainable; this would also marginally bloat css etc. etc. go into the jquery.ui...css and remove the ""ui-corner-all"" declaration - bad given that this would affect everything previously relying on the class; also the classes would continue being added at runtime although without visible effect go into the jquery-ui...js and remove the class reference from the section as quoted above - bad practice modifying the library itself, what if I want the corners back? likely unmaintainable too it would contribute to non-separation of concerns go into the main.css and add semantic classes overriding jquery styling above - solid approach except that every single property will need to be overridden quickly bloating into .tab-container .tab {background-color:pink; -moz-border-radius:0;-webkit-border-radius:0;border-radius:0;} etc. Currently leaning towards having the majority of semantically agnostic styles removed - I'm a believer that mini-classes are bad and come with similar maintainability issues to those of inline styling. Quite tempted to look into having brand-specific widgets introduced at least for some elements (i.e. &lt;ul data-role=""awesomebrand-customtabs""&gt;), but it will require a lot more effort and is outside of the scope for this question.

3806917,which method of placing things in the graphics pipeline for d3d11 is more efficient?,"So from looking around at examples and tutorials, it seems the most common method of placing buffers in the pipeline is, every model object gets it's own vertex buffer, and then after the buffers are filled, they lock, set the buffers, unlock, set shaders, draw, and rinse/repeat for every models individual buffer. seems to me that all that locking and unlocking would slow things down a bit. So i'm wondering if maybe the model objects could instead aggregate all their vertices into 1 big array, all the indices in a big array, create 1 large buffer, lock once, set buffers once, unlock, and then switch out shaders and draw as many polygons as required with those shaders, and just work your way along the buffer drawing and switching shaders like before, instead of having to lock and drop more vertices in the pipeline every time before you draw. Would this be any more efficient, or do you think the overhead from all the bookkeeping involved,(for example, from index a to index b, use this shader), would just make this more work than it's worth? also, if i have missed a concept of d3d here, please inform me. ( i'm new) EDIT due to massive misunderstanding, anywhere where i refered to locking and unlocking, was actually supposed to just be calling IASetVertexBuffer/IASetIndexBuffer. The ""revised"" question is more or less: Does stuffing the vertices for all the models in the scene into one single buffer, and simply calling IASetVertexBuffer once improve perforamance at all?",[],False

Suppose I want to model computers and phones. In my model, both computers and phones are machines. So I make a 'Machine' class, a 'Computer' class and a 'Phone' class. Phone and Computer inherit from Machine (concrete inheritance). This is just an example of course. Now I want to link those products to the People table. Seeing as there's no difference between Phone or Computer when it comes to linking them with People, I would expect the inheritance to create a link between Machine and People, NOT between Computer and People or Phone and People. However: doctrine creates a Machine table which is always empty (as stated in the symfony docs). So if I add my first Phone, it gets ID 1. If I add my first computer, it also gets ID 1. So in order to implement my link with people this whole concrete inheritance scheme is useless, no? I have to create two separate linking tables: one linking Phones to People and one linking Computers to People. I would have expected doctrine to save both Phones and Computers in the Machine table, giving them a fresh ID every time and then copying that ID to the Phone or Computer table.

When the cache is full and a new entry is needed, the code will scan the entire cache map and find the entry with the lowest , and remove it. The problem with this is that once the cache is full, every insertion requires a full scan of the cache. Another idea was to hold a list of in addition to the cache map, and on each access move the accessed entry to the top of the list, but the problem was how to quickly find that entry in the list.

3905186,Is JSONP a must for your API?,"I have a WCF API which supports SOAP/JSON/XML but we don't provide JSONP. This means if someone wants to consume our API using JSON they must create a server side proxy to get around the cross browser limitation. I kind of like this since it discourages users from putting api keys and secrets in client side code. While most methods accept and access token, we have auth methods which require the consumer to send key and secret to get this access token. If we expose JSONP some consumers may make this request client side and I'm not thrilled with that. So... if you have an API that supports JSON, is it essential to support JSONP. Is it terrible to require consumers to create a server side proxy? JSONP is not hard to implement but for reason stated above I'm hesitant. Kinda just looking for thoughts/advice. Thanks",[],False

Now I would like to have the game paused the same way when onStop() gets called. I put both threads on pause and saved my characters location in the savedInstanceState, but when I start my app again, no method gets called (I checked with Logcat). I believe onRestart() should be called first, then onStart() and then onResume(), but none of that happens. What am I doing wrong?

3924387,How can a moderately sized memory allocation fail in a 64 bit process on Mac OS X?,"I'm building a photo book layout application. The application frequently decompresses JPEG images into in-memory bitmap buffers. The size of the images is constrained to 100 megapixels (while they usually do not exceed 15 megapixels). Sometimes memory allocations for these buffers fail: returns . This seems to happen in situations where the systems's free physical memory approaches zero. My understanding of the virtual memory system in Mac OS X was that an allocation in a 64 bit process virtually (sic) can't fail. There are 16 exabyte of address space of which I'm trying to allocate a maximum of 400 megabytes at a time. Theoretically I could allocate 40 billion of these buffers without hitting the hard limit of the available address space. Of course practical limits would prevent this scenario as swap space is constrained by the boot volume's size. In reality I'm only making very few of these allocations (less than ten). What I do not understand is the fact that an allocation fails, no matter how low physical memory is at that point. I thought that—as long as there's swap space left—memory allocation would not fail (as the pages are not even mapped at this point). The application is garbage collected. Edit: I had time to dig into this problem a little further and here are my findings: The problem only occurs in a garbage collected process. When the allocation from fails, a plain still succeeds to allocate the same amount of memory. The error always happens when overall physical memory approaches zero (swapping is about to take place). I assume uses to perform the allocation instead of when running under garbage collection. My conclusion from all that is that the collector is unable to allocate big chunks of memory when physical memory is low. Which again, I don't understand.","['[[NSMutableData alloc] initWithLength:]', 'nil', 'NSMutableData', 'malloc', 'NSData', 'NSAllocateCollectable', 'malloc']",False

Eg. something like (but not) { 'values' : { '$gt' : 1, '$lt': 5} }) which would successfully return the first two but not the third doc, as not all elements of the third doc's array 'values' match the criteria. Apparently mongodb uses an implicit OR in queries on arrays, whereas I need AND. I guess I could manually index each element, eg.: collection.find({values.0: {$gt:1,$lt:5}, values.1:{$gt:1,$lt:5}, ... values.n:{$gt:1,$lt:5}}) but this is a pain with my highly dynamic arrays. Is there a better way? Note: I asked this over at mongodb-user but being new to mongodb generated confusion with $all operator. Here I am concerned about the doc array, not a query array.

4144342,Externally managed htaccess-protected members area in WordPress with url rewriting?,"I am considering converting a client project from a large number of hand-built web pages to a WordPress install. However, this client has a free area (site.com/) and a members area (site.com/members/). The members area is standard Apache .htaccess / htpasswd authentication. The authentication is handled by legacy billing software which we don't want to change at this time. One thought is to put up two separate WordPress installs (or perhaps a MultiSite install?). One install sits on the domain root and the other sits at /members/. Thus neither install has to know anything about being password-protected. So long as the outer install cannot generate a url which includes /members/, I'm pretty sure the url-rewrite engines won't interfere with each other. Another thought is to try to do everything in a single install, and expect the server to force authentication on any url that maps to /members/. But intuitively it feels like I'd have to go to a custom taxonomy to get ""free area"" category hierarchies separate from ""member area"" hierarchies. Any WordPress plugins which I've found, and any related discussions, assume that the members are managed via WordPress. That's the issue: the members area is simply protected via old-school htaccess authentication. I'm not sure that the WordPress url-rewrite mechanism would trigger the authentication part as intended, given that WordPress is sitting at the domain root, outside the members area. On the other hand, running it as two WordPress installs, one inside the other, might be just what I need. Anyone have perspective on this?

Additional information: my app isn't that simple. i use three20 framework for my app but the pushing and creating of the view controllers is simply what three20 does. i only can hook into the part between ( in my code). i cannot change the code before and after this (except with a lot of researching).","['/* THIS CANNOT BE CHANGED */\n    AnimatedViewController *animatedViewController = [[AnimatedViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@""AnimatedViewController"" bundle:nil];\n\n    /* THIS CAN BE CHANGED */\n    animatedViewController.view.transform = CGAffineTransformMakeScale(0.01, 0.01);\n    [UIView beginAnimations:@""animationExpand"" context:NULL];\n    [UIView setAnimationDuration:0.6f];\n    animatedViewController.view.transform=CGAffineTransformMakeScale(1, 1);\n    [UIView setAnimationDelegate:self];\n    [UIView commitAnimations];\n\n    /* THIS CANNOT BE CHANGED */\n    [self.navigationController pushViewController:animatedViewController animated:NO];\n', 'THIS CAN BE CHANGED']",False

4213493,Best practice for centralized web service authentication handling,"I have an app that utilizes several web services to pull data throughout its lifespan. It's possible (and likely) that the user's session cookie will expire during normal use. I've built a common controller to handle the login process (obscuring the app with a modal view, requesting the user login, etc) but need to make a way that any of the views that make a service request and get a 401 response can readily ask the central login system re-authenticate the user and then return back to re-issue the request. I've tried two approaches: 1) Using KVO in each view controller to observe a value within the login controller to be notified of a new session. This makes a lot of redundant code across the VCs and flags within them to keep track of where to return to. 2) Setting up a primitive ""listener/notify"" mechanism from the central location. This is more work than I think I want to get into and, although familiar to me from Javascript, seems out of place in objective-c. Another option is to use a protocol/delegate approach but I'm uncertain how that would work with multiple views wanting to be the same login controller's delegate. What's the best way to do this sort of thing?",[],False

4370457,"iOS/iPhone: in-app purchase sandbox broken while app in ""rejected"" state?","(See MAIN THRUST below to skip to the main thrust of my question.) My iOS app was rejected in the Apple review process for a minor reason that was easy to fix. However, I wanted to give the new build a once-over testing, including retesting our in-app purchase (there is only a single purchasable item in the app). And now the app crashes when doing the initial retrieval of the product information. It never crashed in this way before, and the code hasn't changed since we successfully tested the in-app purchase in sandbox mode many times. (In fact, no code changed at all between the initially submitted version and this version with the minor fix; the fix was just an info.plist setting change.) To complicate matters, I'm using the Airplay/Marmalade SDK for building the app, and they wrap the Objective C calls and callback mechanism with their own API and callback mechanism. However, this wrapper is very thin, so I'm hope/believe that this is really a general iOS/in-app purchase question, not something specific to Marmalade. So, as I say, it's crashing somewhere between the time I make the Marmalade call to retrieve product information and the time my (C++) callback should be called. (I.e., somewhere between the time that Marmalade calls [productsRequest start] on an SKProductsRequest object, and the time productsRequest:didReceiveResponse() is called and Marmalade calls me back in turn.) MAIN THRUST of my question: My app is in ""rejected"" state on iTunesConnect. Furthermore, when I look at the in-app purchase item itself in iTunesConnect, it's also marked as ""Rejected"". However, I've already discussed my in-app purchase with Apple during the review process, and it is my belief that the in-app purchase itself works fine for them, and the only remaining problem was the minor issue that I've already fixed (this is what their rejection details said: just that one item). So: I need to understand whether, when my app (and it's associated in-app purchase) are in this ""rejected"" state pending a new binary upload from me, it's actually tricky (or maybe impossible) to really re-test the in-app purchase, and my best course of action is just to resubmit the app with the minor fix and have faith that (since it's the same code that worked during normal testing when things weren't in the rejected state) the state of the in-app purchase will work itself out once Apple resets everything to test the new binary. Or is there something different I should do at this point that would allow me to re-test the in-app purchase? I was thinking of asking Apple in the iTunesConnect correspondence, but I didn't want to introduce any complications with them, since the review process has been amazingly fast and efficient so far.",[],False

Python has at least two queue classes, Queue.Queue and collections.deque, with the former seemingly using the latter internally. Both claim to be thread-safe in the documentation. However, the Queue docs also state: collections.deque is an alternative implementation of unbounded queues with fast atomic append() and popleft() operations that do not require locking. Which I guess I don't quite unterstand: Does this mean deque isn't fully thread-safe after all? If it is, I may not fully understand the difference between the two classes. I can see that Queue adds blocking functionality. On the other hand, it loses some deque features like support for the in-operator. Accessing the internal deque object directly, is x in Queue().deque thread-safe? Also, why does Queue employ a mutex for it's operations when deque is thread-safe already?",[],False

There is no safe level of consumption of methanol as there are with other less poisonous substances that can occasionally find their way into our foods. Methanol is particularly dangerous to humans, more so than any other animal.

Other Information One thing of note is that I have a small flash-drive permanently plugged into a USB port on the back that I use to boot DOS without using a floppy or CD.

Anyway, I made a modification on the GUI to make it more user-friendly, initially the program shows up the main window and it's possible to open some other frames where the user can monitor certain devices designed by the company I work for. So when the user wanted to close the hole program and any windows where openend it showed up a dialog asking for the user close the oppened windows himself and then close the program, that was really ugly so I thought: let's make it better; and that's what I made: when s that use serial communication are opened I just save a reference for it for future use if the user prompt to close the program than before exit, the program performs the following code to ensure that the respective listeners are called like stop reading from the serial port: The program doesn't crash when the dialogs are closed by the user so there is no problem on the s that are responsible for shuting the communication down, and sometimes it crashes when prompt to close while online windows are oppened (in serial communication aspect), actually the crash itself is not visible for the user (just if he look into program's folder the hs_err_pid.log files) and happens about 20% of the closes with online windows. The crash in hs_err are like: so what I suppose it's happening is that the dll tries to write to java's memory after it was already closed so the jvm crashes (correct me if I'm wrong). What I want is a way to not generate those error log files, it can be made fixing the problem or just a way to hide those files, if possible that I thing the answer is not.

So, put all users not in group 'A' into group 'B', a user is in a group when there is a UserGroup with that UserID and that GroupID in existence. How can I write a query that will insert a UserGroup of UserID and GroupID of group 'B' for all the users that do not already have a UserGroup with the GroupID of group 'A'?

I'm starting to understand some things about Python, but combining several things is still giving me issues, so I can't figure this out. Here's my problem: I have many CSV files, and here's what I need done: add a ""column"" to the front of each row (or the back, doesn't matter really, but front is ideal). In addition, each line has 5 rows (not counting the filename that will be added), and here's the format: 6-digit ID number,YYYY-MM-DD(1),YYYY-MM-DD(2),YYYY-MM-DD(3),1-2-digit number I need to subtract YYYY-MM-DD(3) from YYYY-MM-DD(2) for every line in the file (there is no header row), for every CSV in a given directory. I need the filename inside the row because I will combine the files (which, if is included in the script would be awesome, but I think I can figure that part out), and I need to know what file the records came from. Format of filename is always '4-5-digit-number.csv' I hope this makes sense, if it does not, please let me know. I'm kind of stumped as to where to even begin, so I don't have any sample code that even really began to work for me.

4574252,How to change the lightbox size in galleria? (Answer Provided),"NOTE: This is both a question and a solution provided. If you are using the classic theme in galleria photo gallery, you will notice that many things are configurable, but one thing, that seems to be fixed, is the size of the light box. This was very frustrating to me and it took me a while to dig out the setting, but it turned out that the solution is pretty simple - one code line change. I wanted to post it for others, so they can adjust their lightbox size, and not go through the trouble I did. SOLUTION: Open the file - Find this code line - Change it to this - NOTE: If you make this change, the lightbox size will be as big as the actual image size you are displaying. Think of this value 1, as equal to 100%. Therefore if you would like the lightbox to be 1.5 times bigger than the actual image, set the value to 1.5. Conversely, if you would like it to display only 80% of the actual image size, set it to 0.8. Also, this code line is inside a section, which looks like this: You can clearly see that a math formula is used to dynamically calculate the size for each image. If you would like a fixed lightbox size, then play with these values: , .

4769245,C++ static const and initialization (is there a fiasco),"I am returning to C++ after a long absence and I am stumbling a little over my understanding of the fairly well known static initialization problem. Let's say I have a simple class Vector2 as given below (note that I am aware that x and y should be private with getters and setters, these have just been omitted for brevity): Now, if I want to specify a static const member to represent a Vector2 with x and y set to 1, I am unsure on how to proceed - will static const members fall foul of the static initialization problem or will the act of making them const mean they are ok? I am toying with the following possibilities: Possibility 1: Possibility 2: Possibility 3: Now, my preferred way to write this would be as in possibility 2, just because it is a more comfortable syntax for me. However, if I call the getOne() method from another static method in another class am I going to risk crashing and burning? As I say, it is because I am using a static const rather than a plain static that I am asking this question as I have found much on plain static class member issues, but nothing on const static issues. I suspect that I gain nothing by the fact that I am using static const and will need to go with Possibility 3 to be safe, but I just want to ask in case someone can shed some light on this for me.

The form that needs completing is quite complicated, and also includes some if / then / else logic when going through e.g: Complete personal details Enter postcode If 1 result found goto 5 Display list of possible addresses, when one selected goto 5 If time at address &lt; 3 years, display new address page etc. 2 is not allowed by windows default settings), is there a better way of doing this?

Once upon a time a previous SP admin installed Project Server on the SP server, but it was never used. Some action was taken so that now SharePoint sees a site collection which was obviously used for projects (obvious by the naming of the collection) that make the collection inaccessible (via browser). The plan is to clean up this SharePoint environment and upgrade to 2010 (on new hardware). There is no desire to use Project Server. I have heard that project server cannot be uninstalled safely from the SP server. Is that true? Would there be a problem with just 'ignoring' project server in production, not install it on the new 2010 hardware and SharePoint will just never know it existed in the old environment? If not, what do I have to do to detach project server from SP in the new environment?",[],False
4895846,How to convert multiple textboxes to one value,"In my WPF application the user is inputting a GPS coordinates in the format of Degrees : Minutes : Seconds as decimal fraction of minutes. So 60° 30' 45"" would be entered as 60° 30.750' . I then store it as a pure decimal number so the above example would be stored as 60.5125. The idea was that so the users wouldn't mess up the input it would be set in 3 different textboxes. One for Degrees, other for Minutes and one for the fractionalSeconds. It's somewhat bad that one of the numbers is seperated into two textboxes but if they have to type the whole number in the are afraid of all the point or comma confusion and that they could mess up. So one thing I thought might work was a IMultiValueConverter but it seems to only work with MultiBindings which is something I'm not doing here. Currently my solution is to bind to different properties and do all the calculations in code behind but I'm not really happy about the fractional bit. I assume 3 fractional letters but if they enter only 7 and assume 0.700 but get 0.007 so I thought I would have to do a string format bit. Is there a better solution out there.

When tapped, the top layer animates down to indicate the button's been pressed. Here's what it looks like: This was running slowly, and research indicated it was because I was using the layer property, , etc. I read that clipping to a UIBezierPath is faster than using corner radius, and things like that. So now I'm drawing the button in , and there's no offscreen rendering, so there's no slowdown: But the problem is that I'm not sure how to animate the top part of the button downward when it is tapped. Previously I was just setting the layers property and it would implicitly animate. I'm sort of fuzzy on all the different ways to achieve animation, but from what I can tell there is only Core Animation on layers, or the convenience UIView functions that wrap Core Animation? So my question is: what is the recommended way for me to animate the top of this button down while keeping performance high? If I make the top part its own layer, how can I achieve rounded corners by clipping instead of using ? Is there any way I can achieve this effect without any offscreen rendering?

The root cause is a CA0053 error loading the custom rules assembly. I understand that these references to the three assemblies need to be updated to version 11 for Visual Studio 2012. This can be done using version redirects in config files. I can get this to work locally by redirecting the Visual Studio 2012 IDE and FxCopCmd binaries, but am running into trouble when checking code into TFS 2010. There are two apparent solutions we have considered, but neither is very palatable. The first is to require each developer to redirect locally, and then modify the TFS build agents to redirect as well. The second is to maintain two branches of the custom code analysis rules, one targeting version 10 (VS2010) and the other targeting version 11 (VS2012). Is there a better way to do this, or do we need to all upgrade to TFS 2012 and Visual Studio 2012 simultaneously?",[],False

5114824,Linphone compiling problems on osx,"I'm trying to compile linphone on mountain lion. I have downloaded the sources and followed all the instructions in the README.macos file. The first time, when I got to '$ port install ige-mac-integration' an error occurred. It said gtk2 had to be installed with x11, however, the instructions said to install it with quartz and no_x11. I tried installing gtk2 again, this time with x11, but when I get to the compiling process it tells me quartz is needed. I can't install both, because the gtk2 installation will complain about it, and it seems I need both to complete the entire process of installing and compiling linphone. I have tried these steps with the downloadable sources, as well as the git sources, both gave me the same problems. Linphone does not have a forum, so I couldn't ask it on their site. I just need to get the sources and start using them, so any recommendations on how to open the linphone source, edit it, and compile/run it would be very welcome.

Both apps work independently with their own auth systems. Users share a common unique ID, but have different authentication tokens (username/password/key etc) at each app. The two complicating factors are as follows: One app B user may associate with two app A users (e.g. both accounts at app B would redirect and login to the same app A account) The app B user may not actually have any existing auth tokens, only their personal record and user ID, but we still want to be able to log them in if they are coming from app A. My first thoughts were OAuth - but I don't think it will work as some users don't have app B accounts and thus won't be able to log in to grant app A access (see point 2 above). The simplest way I have come up with is: Each app has a pre-shared key e.g. ""LOLS"" Common hash algo generates indepentent identical tokens e.g. hash(PSK + UID) App B stores hashed tokens for each user App A sends POST with UID and hashed token to App B, which uses it to identify and auth against a user The problem with this is that it's hideously insecure. Anyone with knowledge of the pre-shared key (any system admin) and a user's ID (once again, any system admin) would be able to authenticate as ANY user, which is unacceptable. Does anyone have any solutions? I'd prefer existing standards but am open to customised implementations. We can't really do much to app B other than to get them to use whatever API we provide.",[],False

5285408,Cocoa: pasting formatted text in the current font?,"When I put formatted text into the pasteboard (NSRTFPboardType), it pastes with all formatting preserved. But what I'd really like is to discard the font face and size information, while preserving the weight, color, etc. According to the docs, an NSAttributedString with no font information will default to Helvetica 12, so that seems like a dead end. I can also generate the text on demand, so if I could find out the font in the current UI element, I could modify the text before it goes into the pasteboard. I was hoping the accessibility API could help with this, but none of the attributes I can find in the UIElementInspector seem to deal with formatting. Any ideas? Here's a test case. It pastes in Helvetica 12 even though the only attribute is a green color: Here's something interesting. If I try and generate the plainest raw RTF data I can, with absolutely no font information, it still pastes in Helvetica 12!

5299933,How do you fix an SVN 409 Conflict Error,"I used to use SVN 1.4 on OS X Leopard and everything was fine. A couple of weeks ago I installed a fresh copy of OS X 10.6. The version of SVN that comes with Snow Leopard is 1.6.5. I went ahead and built my own copy with 1.6.6. I'm using the built in apache server and just hosting repositories locally. Everything appeared to work fine until I actually tried to commit something. Everytime I try to commit a change, I get the following message: This happens with my old repositories, so I created a couple of new ones. Same deal. I also tried using the 1.6.5 version that comes with the system...same. Finally, I tried upgrading to the latest stable SVN (1.6.9) and still got the same problem. The Apache error logs the following for each failed commit: And from the access log: Curiously, the commit does actually commit the changes, but the working copy doesn't see that and everything gets screwy. I've tried to Google every variation I can think of for this problem, but the search results are pretty much useless. I'm not using TortoiseSVN or anything special and commits fail on a new repository, so I know it's not a problem with my old repos. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Update I've tried adding autoversioning to my svn.conf file. Here's what my files says: Update (Solution) I just wanted to update this with the actual solution in case anyone else is having the same problem with the completely unhelpful error messages. The problem was with the apr and apr-util parts (as scherand suggested). I was building a copy of both using the subversion dependencies package. OS X 10.6 also has it's own version. Both versions were 1.3.8. Apparently though, I needed to use the versions that the default apache install was using. So, I deleted the apr and apr-util folders from my subversion build, to make sure that I wasn't building my own copy of these again. I built svn from source again, this time using the following configuration: After building again, I restarted apache, and created a new svn repo. I was able to check it out, make changes, and commit without any issues. I then tried my old repos and those worked as well.

5361240,Creating a C++ Template Like Functions With Local Variables in C,"Here's a riddle. Imagine I have the following C++ function: When I instantiate this function as such (all values below are just examples values): The compiler optimizes out the if statements in Foo() because it knows at compile time what the result of said if() statement are. This is nice and well, but trying to do the same in C is problematic because of the creation of the local variable step. If step wasn't there, you could do a large #define like this: But with step, I'm kind of at an impasse. What can I do to obtain the same functionality of C++ template in C for C++ template function with local variables? Note that using inline C functions is not an answer, as the compiler will not know at compile time the value of MASK, and thus all the comparisons will not be optimized and will accordingly be part of the final compiled output. Also note that changing the #define to include the result value is also not an answer, since this changes the ""function's"" signature. And lastly, I am fully aware that there may be no answer to this riddle.","['template&lt;uint8_t MASK&gt;\nuint8_t Foo(uint8_t val)\n{\n    uint8_t step = 0;\n    uint8_t result = 0;\n    if(MASK &amp; 0x01) {result |= (val &amp; 0x01) &gt;&gt; step; ++step;}\n    if(MASK &amp; 0x02) {result |= (val &amp; 0x02) &gt;&gt; step; ++step;}\n    //...etc...\n    if(MASK &amp; 0x80) {result |= (val &amp; 0x80) &gt;&gt; step; ++step;}\n\n    return result;\n}\n', 'uint8_t someval = Foo&lt;0xAA&gt;(44);\n', '#define Foo(MASK, val) (\\\n    ((MASK &amp; 0x01) ?

5458723,Going from 32-bit to 64-bit,"Specifics: VC++ 7; Program works on XP, but crashes on Win7; developed using VS2003.NET (old I know but it's what I have to work with and it works fine thank you very much) I've got a program that runs great on XP (32-bit). However, I've recently tested it with Win7 and all kinds of choas breaks loose. My strong suspicion is how my program deals with registry keys. NOTE: The program does not create or destroy keys, only queries for keys and returns interesting values. (""Interesting"" described below) In the simplest form, the program reads data from a SCSI attached device, and saves the data to a file on the host PC. The program queries the registry for SCSI adapters and returns the adapter IDs which the program uses to access the device. To me, it doesn't look like the registry structure has changed from XP to Win7 but not 100% sure. Any insight on that would be great :) Also, I read at: http://www.techsupportalert.com/content/how-windows7-vista64-support-32bit-applications.htm that the way Win7 does things is like a reflection. Does this change how I should query for the key? If so, any information on how to structure the query would be great. I think what I need to know is: Is it as simple as changing the hKey (or lpValueName) in the RegQueryValueEx method? Or does this mean I need to change some other aspect of the RegQueryValueEx method? Or something else entirely? Thank you in advance!",[],False

Nothing in the PHP error log or stderr. The script is being executed at the cmd line and not interactively. The script runs for about 8min and the temp archive grows and while checking the filesize, the last listing showed the tmp file was 2120011776 in size and then the tmp file disappears and the PHP script falls thru the logic and executes the code after the archive create. For some reason top shows the CPU still at 95% and is creating a new tmp archive file - it does this for say another 5+ min and silently stops and leaves the un-completed tmp archive file. In this test - there was less then 4000 expected files. The script as noted works just fine creating smaller archive files. Tested on several different sets of large source data - same result for large files. This issue sounds similar to this question: Size limit on PHP&#39;s zipArchive class?

I am also wondering what the implications of router/firewall blocking on cellular networks ISPs will be. My current design idea would be putting everything over port 80 to ELB and route this to the TCP server. I'm not completely sold on ELB, so I was wondering: What other options are out there for non http reverse proxy, Can SSL be run on the reverse proxy or does this also need to be run on the TCP server Any recommendations for firewall/router workarounds for cellular networks other than going over port 80.",[],False

Assuming that $g(x,y) = c$ is the restraint, it also ensures the point satisfies the restraint. However, I don't understand the reasoning behind some of the statements in the ideashop link: 1) ""The most important thing to know about gradients is that they always point in the direction of a function's steepest slope at a given point."" . Apparently a gradient is a collection of partial first derivatives but I don't understand how one gets from a collection of partial first derivatives to 'Always pointing in the direction of the steepest slope'. Wouldn't it be changing direction as one went around a 3D surface? 2) Why is the gradient always perpendicular to the level curve? 3) How does one get from $$\nabla L=\begin{bmatrix}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}-\lambda\frac{\partial g}{\partial x_1}\\\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2}-\lambda\frac{\partial g}{\partial x_2}\\g(x_1,x_2)-c\end{bmatrix}=0$$ to $$L(x_1,x_2,\lambda)=f(x_1,x_2)-\lambda(g(x_1,x_2)-c)$$ (Both sourced from ideashop) ?

5745275,Decentralized backup using torrent protocol,I'm playing with an idea of creating client that would use the torrent protocol used today in torrent download client such as uTorrrent or Vuze to create: Client software that would: Select files you would like to backup Create torrent like descriptor files for each file Offer optional encryption of your files based on key phrase Let you select redundancy you would like to trade with other clients (Redundancy would be based on give-and-take principle. If you want to backup 100MB five times you would have to offer extra 500MB of your own storage space in your system. The file backup would not get distributed only amongst 5 clients but it would utilize as many clients as possible offering storage in exchange based on physical distance specified in settings) Optionally: I'm thinking to include edge file sharing. If you would have non encrypted files shared in you backup storage and would prefer clients that have their port 80 open for public HTTP sharing. But this gets tricking since I have hard time coming up with simple scheme where the visitor would pick the closest backup client. Include file manager that would allow file transfers (something like FTP with GUI) style between two systems using torrent protocol. I'm thinking about creating this as service API project (sort of like http://www.elasticsearch.org ) that could be integrated with any container such as tomcat and spring or just plain Swing. This would be P2P open source project. Since I'm not completely confident in my understanding of torrent protocol the question is: Is the above feasible with current state of the torrent technology (and where should I look to recruit developers for this project) If this is the wrong spot to post this please move it to more appropriate site.,['java'],False

I don't care too much about the history in these repositories. I created a new repository and can import the repositories no problem. The issue is with users working copies, I can ask them to switch --relocate them however there is the issue of the UUID which will be different for each original repository: I can only reassign the UUID in the new repository to match one of the original repositories.

One could use this polygon to render the filled contour and if one also uses the data as floats rather than ints, one could achieve font smoothing.

I have validation set up and configured correctly. I know this because I get the validation messages on the corresponding Razor view and the messages are accurate. However, if I modify the Razor view at all (and by ""at all"" I mean something as simple as adding a line break and then immediately deleting it), I get a 500 error accompanied by a blank page. Other times, while in the process of simply refreshing the page to review styling of the Razor view, the validation simply returns a blank page with the same non-useful 500 error. And of course, if I remove the validation, the Razor view renders just fine 100% of the time. What must I do to have validation working at all times? My code is straight forward and matches everything that I've been able to read in the Docs. Namely, both the response and the requests are in the same namespace and the validator is coded to the request. Here is the request DTO Here is the corresponding validator Here is the response And lastly, here is the code that configures the validation plugin As you can see, everything is pretty vanilla and by the book, but this setup is very fragile for some reason. Any modification to the corresponding Razor view and I get the aforementioned errors. Then I have to recompile repeatedly until it works again. I should also mention that, if I use the REST Console (google chrome extension thingy) to test this, I get the following results when posting to the exact same URI: Content-Type set to : application/json - Everything works as intended. 400 Response with the errors listed in the response body.

Problem I have to call login service and the request goes like: but the response is coming in XML format as: RESPONSE: I have to parse this xml to json to get : out of the response. then use the Status, LoggedIn and Id to verify the login. My Idea I am not sure whether its right, I am trying to create two stores, xmlStore and JsonStore. ?? How will I store the xml response inside a string. How Will I pass this string to Json Store (at the place of url?) I may sound very naive to this, but this is my problem ;) Please guide.

Moreover, partition identities have always amused me by how complicated they appear at first to prove. Out of curiosity, can Durfee squares be used to prove either of the following partition identities? $$ \prod_{i\geq 1}(1-qx^i)^{-1}=\sum_{j\geq 0}\frac{x^{j^2}q^j}{(1-x)\cdots(1-x^j)(1-qx)\cdots(1-qx^j)} $$ or $$ \prod_{i\geq 1}(1+qx^{2i-1})=\sum_{j\geq 0}\frac{x^{j^2}q^j}{(1-x^2)(1-x^4)\cdots(1-x^{2j})}? $$ In fact, in Andrews and Eriksson's Integer Partitions, Exercise 101 on page 77 suggests that Durfee squares can be used to determine these formulas.

5949178,Is browser required to detect user timezone for datetime input?,"I installed Opera browser because it is currently the only browser that possess the HTML5 calender functionality. There are two types of input: one is the where timezone information is omitted; the other is itself where time-zone information is added. From what I observe in Opera, the timezone is fixed at UTC instead of following the user's time-zone for input. This seems counter-intuitive as user would normally not know what UTC time is, let alone calculate the correct UTC time based on his own time-zone. Does W3C requires UTC to be the default timezone for input, or is Opera browser doing the right thing by fixing timezone as UTC? Upon further research, this is what I find: whatwg seems to suggest the opposite way: datetime (specific year, month, day, time) datetime-local (specific year, month, day, time, timezone) Mozilla documentation says this: datetime: HTML5 A control for entering a date and time (hour, minute, second, and fraction of a second) based on UTC time zone. W3C proposes the following: User agents must not allow the user to set the value to a non-empty string that is not a valid global date and time string expressed in UTC, though user agents may allow the user to set and view the time in another time zone and silently translate the time to and from the UTC time zone in the value. If the user agent provides a user interface for selecting a global date and time, then the value must be set to a valid global date and time string expressed in UTC representing the user's selection. The format shown to the user is independent of the format used for form submission. Browsers are encouraged to use user interfaces that present dates and times according to the conventions of the user's preferred locale. It seems to me that W3C allows input to be in local format but requires the final value submitted by the form to be expressed in UTC format.","['datetime', 'datetime', 'datetime-local', 'datetime', 'datetime', 'datetime', 'datetime']",False

5992999,How do I group a query after ordering it?,"I'm trying to group a query after i order it, however, in sql (im using DB2) we can't group by after doing order, but if I order after grouping the grouping changes. The reason for this is because its grouped based on multiple attributes not just 1 (i only need to group by 1 attribute but since we are required to match the select statement I have to group by multiple attributes. I tried doing a virtual table using ""with"" and tried to order within that but DB2 says that I can only group and not order inside the with attribute The same goes in the from statement . I tried doing a nested query inside the from attribute which returns the ordered result but DB2 restricts us from ordering inside the from attribute (only grouping is allowed) So I'm not sure how to do this, how can I group something after ordering it? Here is a sample table: pokemon: id name age 3 pikachu 1 2 bulbasure 3 1 charazard 2 11 pikachu 10 (in pokemon table) primary key id, name foreign key (name) references pokedex (name) ) pokedex: id status pikachu derp charazard herp bulbasure burp now what I'm trying to do is list the pokemon table with: ORDER BY age, name but after that I want the result to be grouped by their id however Im selecting their id, name, age and status so when grouping I have to match those attributes: GROUP BY pokedex.id age status..... so the problem is if I order after the grouping it breaks the grouping of pokedex.id since its grouped by status and other attributes aswell Just an example, not really building anything related to pokemon :P",[],True

6010520,Why is this else: pass needed for processing to continue?,"Can someone explain why the shown below is needed in order for the rest of the code (the final statement) to be executed? Note the in the was put there just so I could tell that execution was indeed taking that path. It seems like that should happen whenever the isn't executed since code in the does nothing. However, if I leave the out, nothing further in the loop appears to be executed when the condition is False -- when files with the extension do exist in the directory -- which doesn't make sense to me. The docs say ""continues with the next cycle of the nearest enclosing loop"", fine, but if one is not executed, shouldn't processing should proceed to the next statement? Mystery Solved The seemingly strange behavior was due to an indentation problem which is not visible in the code above nor normally in my text editor. It turned out that the last statement was indented by 3 spaces then a tab, which makes it appear to align with the , but in fact it either follows the the in the if it's there, or follows the in the first part of the .
