26245,TChromiumFMX - Create at runtime,"I'm currently trying to create a basic web browser in Firemonkey with TChromiumFMX. I originally posted to the group for the project but received no response in several weeks. There appears to be an issue while attempting to create a TChromiumFMX at runtime. I initially attempted to create it from within my application. As that threw up Access Violation errors, i then tried the DLL route with exported procedures. The error is as such; Exception Class: EAccessViolation Exception Message: Access violation at address in module . Read of address 00000000. The first address is seemingly random dependant on what i change within my code (slight tweaks to attempt to fix it, all to no avail), while the second address is always 00000000. For example; Access Violation at address 0117B40A in 'ChromDLL.dll'. Read of address 00000000. Code is as follows; That's from the DLL version, but the code i wrote within the application version was very similar and also fails with a similar Access Violation. This issue only occurs with the FMX/Firemonkey component and does NOT occur with the VCL version using similar code (where TChromiumFMX is replaced with TChromium). I'm curious if anyone has discovered a fix for this yet? I've searched and searched for weeks now, and have yet to find a solution, and the few people even talking about similar issues were on the issues page of Google Code. I did try forcefully assigning it's owner and parent to an object with the ""in-application"" version of the code but again, no such luck. The access violation occurs when i tell it to navigate to a URL. I did notice that i had to call ""Application.OnIdle"" to ""doOnIdleEvent"" and ""FLoading"" to ""False"" when the form is created in order for the initial browser window that's been created at design time to function, but i've had no luck with doing the same when i create one at runtime.

245377,What is the reasoning for the Discount Factor formula?,"I've previously come across dicount factors in my high school education but we had formula sheets so I never bothered actually learning it. In my university I have a business class in which we are now going over dicounted cash flows. Now that I'm a much more enthusiatic learner I would really like to know why the discount formula works and/or the reasoning behind it. The formula is as follows: where r is the discount rate and t is the amount of years. This is more business related than math related. So if your wondering why I posted this here I figured that mathmaticians would be able to better explain the reason/origins of the formula, whereas all I've gotten from asking business realted experts is pretty much 'the fomula works so it's good enough for me' sort of answers.",['Discount factor = 1 / (1 + r)^t\n'],False
245860,"Web-based, hosted admin tool for SQL Server database access","I work extensively with MySQL and have no experience with SQL Server. But I have an upcoming project where the existing site's database is on SQL Server. I will be needing to make periodic glances at the existing database, to make SQL dumps most likely so I can write a migration script to the new site database in MySQL. The client will be regularly updating this existing database so just asking for a one-time dump will not help. Ideally I am looking for a web-based (or desktop based) tool which will allow me to log in to the SQL Server database (I have remote access) and allow me to make a dump or perhaps browse the database structure. Something similar to phpMyAdmin would be nice. Update: I should clarify that web-based tools which are ASP based are not ideal. As much as I'd like to learn more about ASP, I do not have the time to set up another environment just to run the tool. Something hosted by a 3rd party would do the trick.",[],False

309519,SQL Server 2000 Deadlock,"We are experiencing some very annoying deadlock situations in a production SQL Server 2000 database. The main setup is the following: SQL Server 2000 Enterprise Edition. Server is coded in C++ using ATL OLE Database. All database objects are being accessed trough stored procedures. All UPDATE/INSERT stored procedures wrap their internal operations in a BEGIN TRANS ... COMMIT TRANS block. I collected some initial traces with SQL Profiler following several articles on the Internet like this one (ignore it is referring to SQL Server 2005 tools, the same principles apply). From the traces it appears to be a deadlock between two UPDATE queries. We have taken some measures that may have reduced the likelihood of the problem from happening as: SELECT WITH (NOLOCK). We have changed all the SELECT queries in the stored procedures to use WITH (NOLOCK). We understand the implications of having dirty reads but the data being queried is not that important since we do a lot of automatic refreshes and under normal conditions the UI will have the right values. READ UNCOMMITTED. We have changed the transaction isolation level on the server code to be READ UNCOMMITED. Reduced transaction scope. We have reduced the time a transaction is being held in order to minimize the probabilities of a database deadlock to take place. We are also questioning the fact that we have a transaction inside the majority of the stored procedures (BEGIN TRANS ... COMMIT TRANS block). In this situation my guess is that the transaction isolation level is SERIALIZABLE, right? And what about if we also have a transaction isolation level specified in the source code that calls the stored procedure, which one applies? This is a processing intensive application and we are hitting the database a lot for reads (bigger percentage) and some writes. If this were a SQL Server 2005 database I could go with Geoff Dalgas answer on an deadlock issue concerning Stack Overflow, if that is even applicable for the issue I am running into. But upgrading to SQL Server 2005 is not, at the present time, a viable option. As these initial attempts failed my question is: How would you go from here? What steps would you take to reduce or even avoid the deadlock from happening, or what commands/tools should I use to better expose the problem?",[],False

332058,"MySQL problem: ""Incorrect key file for table ...""","I'm trying to migrate a mysql server to new hardware. The old server runs mysql 4.1.12 on RHEL 4; the new server is mysql 5.1.41 on Ubuntu 10.04. I've been having some strange issues trying to migrate one of the databases. I tried using mysqldump, but the file won't import properly into the new server because it complains about duplicate keys on a particular table, even though I've checked and am pretty sure there are in fact no duplicate keys. Since I spent several days fighting with the mysqldump approach without finding a solution, I decided instead to copy the entire /var/lib/mysql directory from the old server to the new one. This seemed to work well, with mysql starting up without complaining and all of the data seemingly present. However, a Web application that uses one of the databases fails to work, complaining, ""Incorrect key file for table 'activities'; try to repair it, line194"" (interestingly, the table that I'm having trouble with is NOT the one that mysqldump was unable to import due to duplicate key errors, although they are both on the same database). I've run REPAIR TABLE on this table from within the mysql shell, but it fails with the message ""Corrupt."" I also tried myisamchk with the --recover and --safe-recover flags for this table. In both cases, it says it fixed errors, but the Web application still complains about an incorrect key file. What confuses me most is that (while mysqld is shut down) I've run an md5sum on the MYI file for the table in question, and it's identical on both the old server and the new server. If the table files are identical on the two machines, I'm puzzled as to why the key file is incorrect on one but not the other. I almost suspect this is a bug with mysql, but I'm not positive. I'd be really grateful for any help or suggestions, as I'm out of ideas on how to solve this. I'm no mysql guru, so maybe I'm missing something obvious.",[],False

349387,"How should one deal with 'hot' pixels on Canon T1i, either in-camera on in Aperture?","I recently took quite a few pictures at my brothers wedding, and when going through them in Aperture 3, I noticed a pretty apparent red pixel towards the bottom left of my images. I didn't notice this all that much before, but since a lot of these photos were taken indoors with darker colors (like everyone in tuxedos and suits), its easy to see. I started going through many old pictures, and noticed the same dead pixel. And then again last night, while importing another set, I noticed another hot pixel, this time in the upper right. I tried the common method described online, doing a 'Manual Sensor Cleaning' thats found commonly online (one example here). I did this for about 30 seconds, but still notice them. I haven't tried longer yet. When looking for other ways to solve this, I found that it also may a difference in the way Aperture and/or Lightroom and other apps display this. Supposedly Lightroom processes them for you, but I don't think Aperture does this. What is the best way to handle these? I would obviously like to fix it in the camera if I can, but is there a better way to fix these in post processing when using Aperture - other than doing a small spot healing on every photo?

362664,Struggling with logic for checking consecutive data entries,"I'm trying to figure out how to handle a tricky little situation I've found myself in this morning. I have an entries table in my database where I store details about users' monthly entries (information capture stuff) - I want to increment the number (not the ID) of each entry once a month has passed. The idea is to use the ""number"" field to be able to identify consecutive monthly entries and to disregard entries within close proximity to one another. When a user visits the site to start a new entry, I check the date of the last entry completed to see if it is more than 21 days ago (which qualifies as being a valid month) then I increment the ""number"" for this new entry. The problem is that I can end up with a sequence of entries which are all less than 21 days apart (and thus all have the same number), but collectively span more than 21 days!

In order to save the objects to the php based controller I have the following options. Option 1 For each objects (100 objects) do the following Take object definition 2 .convert to json Do http post to the php controller the php controller saves it to a file or database. Option 2 Variable bigJsonString; For each objects (100 objects) do the following Take object definition 2 .convert to json append the json to a string variable ""bigJsonString"" with a delimitter to indicate end of object. After the big fat bigJsonString is constructed Do http post to the php controller by sending ""bigJsonString"" the php controller saves it to a file or database. In option 1, I am doing 100 http posts one after another. Does this raise any alarms? Is this normal for web applications doing ajax post? The second option seems safe but then the only concern is when the 100 objects become say 500 objects or to a point where the ""bigJsonString"" goes several Megabytes long. The third option we can introduce is a hybrid of option 1 and 2 where we start by constructing the ""bigJsonString"" and if the length goes to a certain limit then do a ajax post. Flush the string and build the string again for remaining objects. What are the pitfalls and what is the normal or standard practice. if someone can point to resources where this is already analysed, that would be great. Thanks very much.",[],False

So I am thinking that I have got something wrong with my media player states but am not sure. i had this bit of code working if I go to another activity from the list view image and play the audio in that activity then return to the list view and click on another image to play audio, but I dont want to do this as creating a mediaPlayer object every time a image is selected is probably bad for memory and I think what I am trying to do should be possible. I have some basic methods to control the media player using the media controller and this used to come up if i had it in a different activity when I touched the screen but the ontouch event does not respond anymore either. Ideally rather then clicking on the image to stop the media player I want to bring up the media controller to control the audio. If the audio is already playing and i click the image again I added some code to check if the audio is playing and then release and stop the media player but this did not fix anything. i have left this in and the logs are with this bit of code included. My phone which I am using has a sdk of 4.0.4. I am developing in Eclipse. thanks in advance. Below is my activity file which plays the audio when it recieves the onclick event. The parent layout for the list view This is my row.xml layout I have included two log files. The first one is with the mediaplayer.reset() method And this one is with the mediaPlayer.reset method commented out.","['package com.example.android.htc.test;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport

I have my background image which is 5000 x 500 and lets say I want to draw an image that's 25x25 at 500, 50 of the background image. How would I do that? So far I've tried: But this just draws it at 500, 50 of the frame so it ""moves"" across the image as I scroll to the right. I want, after scroll once to the right, the coin image to draw at 500,50 of the image still so 495, 50 of the frame. I could also use getGraphics of the background image and draw the smaller image onto it, but I think because I set the point it's being draw at during the creation of the object, I can't do that. The character doesn't move, besides up and down, just the background scrolls so I want the coin to move as the background does.

867231,PHP Form Design Decision: Separation of responsibility,"all. I've been thinking about a design decision for a PHP form and I'd like some input from people smarter than I am. Here are the basics: I have a user input form which lets people register a chapter for a school. I'm doing input validation on the form fields, which lets me a) sanitize the data and b) validate the input. I then intend to send an email to the user who registered (as their email address will be submitted in the form) and write their information into a MySQL database. Right now, I've got the data validation portion (and the requisite error messages) set up through POST, and the page is posting back to itself for the validation. This seemed logical to me as I could easily retain sanitized user input and display errors (for required fields, datatypes, whatnot). If all required fields are filled and the data is valid, I would like to redirect the user to a thank you page with extra information. (Sorry I'm so verbose. I need to work on that.) Thing is, I would like to separate the validation logic and the database write/email logic completely, if possible. My initial idea was to redirect to a thank you page if all fields were valid, but now I'm thinking that the thank you page should actually contain the logic to write to the DB, send an email, and then print the thank you message. This would, however, complicate things and involve passing POST data to another page without using GET. Although I've never had to do anything like this before (I'm fairly new to PHP), this is apparently possible (see here, here, and here) and there are multiple ways to accomplish this. The question, though - should I even be trying to separate this logic in separate PHP pages? Every programming instinct tells me ""hell yes, do it, it's a logical separation of responsibility""....but is this best practice for form handling in PHP? Can anyone with more PHP experience elaborate on the pros and cons of doing something like this, and their experiences? How would you do it?",[],False

For example, in my API there is a 'file' resource that when created contains a number of fields that can not be modified after creation, such as the file's binary data, and some metadata associated with it. Additionally, the 'file' can have a written description, and tags associated. My question concerns doing an update to one of these 'file' resources. A GET of a specific 'file' will return all the metadata, description &amp; tags associated with the file, plus the file's binary data. Should a PUT of a specific 'file' resource include the 'read only' fields? I realize that it can be coded either way: a) include the read only fields in the PUT data and then verify they match the original (or issue an error), or b) ignore the presence of the read only fields in the PUT data because they can't change, never issuing an error if they don't match or are missing because the logic ignores them. Seems like it could go either way and be acceptable. The second method of ignoring the read only fields can be more compact, because the API client can skip sending that read only data if they want; which seems good for people who know what they are doing...",[],False

1009708,Complex Scala Type Inference w/ Lambda Expressions,"I'm working on a DSL for a experimental library I'm building in Scala, and I've run into some vexing peculiarities of Scala's type inference as it pertains to lambda expression arguments that don't seem to be covered in the book Programming In Scala. In my library, I have a trait, Effect[-T], that is used to represent temporary modifiers that can be applied to an object of type T. I have a object, myEffects, that has a method named += that accepts an argument of type Effect[PlayerCharacter]. Lastly, I have a generic method, when[T], that is used for constructing conditional effects by accepting a conditional expression and another effect as an argument. The signature is as follows: When I call the ""when"" method with the above signature, passing it's result to the += method, it is unable to infer the type of the argument to the lambda expression. If I combine the arguments of ""when"" into a single parameter list, Scala is able to infer the type of the lambda expression just fine. It also works if I remove the second parameter entirely. However, for aesthetic reasons, I really want the the arguments to be passed to the ""when"" method as separate parameter lists. My understanding from section 16.10 of Programming in Scala Boolean. This seems to be how it works when the arguments are provided in one parameter list, so why does breaking the arguments into two parameter lists break it?","['def when[T](condition : T =&gt; Boolean) (effect : Effect[T]) : Effect[T]\n', 'myEffects += when(_.hpLow()) (applyModifierEffect) //&lt;-- Compiler error\n', 'def when[T](condition : T =&gt; Boolean, effect : Effect[T]) : Effect[T]\n\n/* Snip */\n\nmyEffects += when(_.hpLow(), applyModifierEffect) //This works fine!\n', 'def when[T](condition : T =&gt; Boolean) : Effect[T]\n\n/* Snip */\n\nmyEffects += when(_.hpLow()) //This works too!\n']",False

As an exercise to try and familiarize myself with Java EE, I'm trying to create a tiered web-app, but I'm getting a little stuck on what the best way is to spin up a service in the background that does work. Parameters of the service: It must open and hold a socket connection and receive information from the connected server. There is a 1-to-1 correlation between a user and a new socket connection. So the idea is the user presses a button on the web-page, and somewhere on the server a socket connection is opened. For the remainder of the users session (or until the user presses some sort of disconnect button) the socket remains open and pushes received information to some sort of centralized store that servlets can query and return to the user via AJAX. Is there a Java EE type way to handle this situation? Naturally what I would think to do is to just write a Java application that listens on a port that the servlets can connect to and spawns new threads that open these sockets, but that seems very ad-hoc to me.

1036512,Building an auditing system; MS Access frontend on SQL Server backend,"So basically I'm building an app for my company and it NEEDS to be built using MS Access and it needs to be built on SQL Server. I've drawn up most of the plans but am having a hard time figuring out a way to handle the auditing system. Since it is being used internally only and you won't even be able to touch the db from outside the building we are not using a login system as the program will only be used once a user has already logged in to our internal network via Active Directory. Knowing this, we're using a system to detect automatically the name of the Active Directory user and with their permissions in one of the DB tables, deciding what they can or cannot do. So the actual audit table will have 3 columns (this design may change but for this question it doesn't matter); who (Active Directory User), when (time of addition/deletion/edit), what (what was changed) My question is how should I be handling this. Ideally I know I should be using a trigger so that it is impossible for the database to be updated without an audit being logged, however I don't know how I could grab the Active Directory User that way. An alternate would be to code it directly into the Access source so that whenever something changes I run an INSERT statement. Obviously that is flawed because if something happens to Access or the database is touched by something else then it will not log the audit. Any advice, examples or articles that may help me would be greatly appreciated!",[],True

1047182,Object enters the visual bounds of another while hitTesting with PaperJS,"I'm writing a simple brick-breaker game using PaperJS. So far I've got the paddle and the ball on the screen. The ball moves and reacts properly to both the paddle and visual bounds of the screen. The problem I'm having is that when the user is moving the paddle left or right and the ball contacts the side of the paddle, the ball will enter the bounding rectangle of the paddle and never escape until the paddle is moved again. If the paddle isn't moving, the ball bounces off the side as expected. What I think is happening is this: When the ball is rebounded and the paddle moves, it's moving faster than the ball which is trapping it inside the paddle. I've tried messing with the speeds of both objects to no avail. Instead the entirety of my code here, I've put it into a working JSFiddle here: http://jsfiddle.net/9dDvj/ To reproduce this, simply move the paddle into the ball.

1124993,Fluent NHibernate Many to many not saving,"I'm having a problem trying to get a many to many relationship to save the join record in NHibernate using Automapper in Fluent NHibernate.

I have the app setup to map, and when i manually create the join record in the DB i do get back the data, so on a read level it is mapping correctly, but it won't persist the relationship. Here's the relevant mapping. I was using automapper with default conventions but eventually tried this based on another SO post. My actually save looks like this. It may be overkill as i'm explicitly saving both postal code and vpa but i read a lot about people having problems with the inverse line in the mapping so i wanted to try both.

The existing application executes each Python script in separate thread and uses cooperative model for this. Now we want to port it to TPL, but first we want to measure context switching . Basically, what we have right now: Tasks queue each from this queue executes one IronPython script Inside IronPython script we call for C# class method, which is synchronization point and should transfer (IronPython execution) to waiting state What we want to do: We want to make infinite loop, which will iterate through s queue when we get one we try to execute it In PythonScript we want to call C# method and transfer this script to waiting state. but not remove it from the queue. On next iteration when we get another we check is it in the waiting state. if so we wake it up and try to execute. In each moment we should have only one active And finally we want to measure how many we could execute per second I don't really know is it something about cooperative multitasking?

1176305,How to stop android from redrawing the entire screen whenever something changes?,"I've got an app that allows users to build complicated screen layouts from a set of predefined controls. Then those controls talk to each other to generate the final functionality. The problem I'm seeing is that no matter what I do it seems that any redrawing caused by a change in one control is forcing the entire screen to redraw (as seen by enabling ""Show Screen Changes""). Because I've got a lot of custom controls without much XML behind them, this redrawing can be pretty slow. For instance, one control might be a calculator which is built from a few linear layouts. Another might be a dynamically generated command grid build from linear layouts. Each of these is then added to a parent relative layout when the screen is loaded. Pressing a key on the calculator forces the command grid to redraw even though nothing has changed in any of its views. I've tried turning on hardware acceleration and changing all of the views' layer types to LAYER_TYPE_HARDWARE with no luck. How do I ensure that only a specific subsection of the screen gets redrawn? At this point I'm not doing any calls to invalidate myself, but I've got my own themable versions of buttons, layouts, and other UI components so if I need to go down to that level of control at least there's already a framework in place for it.",[],False

1257591,Setting up Brauer character theory,"My question relates to p. 147 of Serre's Linear Representations of Finite Groups, where he is setting up the definitions relevant to Brauer character theory. Having fixed an algebraically closed field $K$ of characteristic $p$, we have a finite group $G$ and the set $G^p$ of $p$-regular elements of $G$, i.e. those elements whose order $\left|g\right|$ is coprime to $p$. Assume $K$ is complete with respect to a discrete valuation $\nu:K^\times\to \mathbb{Z}$ with valuation ring $A=\{x\in K\mid \nu(x)\geq 0\}$. By general results about discrete valuation rings, $A$ has a unique maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}=\{x\in K\mid \nu(x)\geq 1\}$, so the quotient $A/\mathfrak{m}$ is a field $k$, called the residue field of $K$. Let $m&#39;=\mathop{\mathrm{lcm}}_{g\in G^p}\left|g\right|$. Q0: Is $\mathrm{char}(k)=p$? Q1: Why must $K$ contain the group $\mu_K$ of $m'$th roots of unity? (I understand this is to do with $K$ being algebraically closed, but can't the fact that $K$ has characteristic $p$ screw things up? What if $m&#39;&gt;p$?) Q2: What is the map $K\to k$ given by reduction modulo $\mathfrak{m}$ and why must this be an isomorphism $\mu_K\to \mu_k$, where $\mu_k$ is the group of $m'$th roots of unity in $k$? And again, why must $\mu_k\subseteq k$? Q3: For $\lambda\in \mu_k$, what does he mean by $\overline{\lambda}$, the ""element of $\mu_K$ whose reduction modulo $\mathfrak{m}$ is $\lambda$""? Q4: Is there a nice example of all of this theory using a particularly simple field of characteristic $p$ with a nice valuation that I would be familiar with and could do some basic computations with?

1277877,AsteriskNow Migration / Shared Extension Space,"I am testing the possibility of migrating from an old Avaya phone system to AsteriskNow. The migration would cover several hundred phones--but spread out over several years. (Management wants to move buildings to the new phone system one by one as cables get cut or time permits.) Two other directive is that extensions must not change and they want a GUI that other admins (non-Linux geeks) can manage. They currently use 9XXX for all extensions. We linked the Avaya and Asterisk box via PRI card and they both are communicating. From the Avaya side, if we move (for example) extension 9001 to Asterisk, we forward the call over the PRI to the AsteriskNow box and the SIP phone rings. In AsteriskNow we have an outgoing rule '_9XXX' that routes all 4-digit extensions starting with 9 back to Avaya. Here's the trouble. Dialing 9001 (the extension moved over to AsteriskNow) causes the call to be routed out the PRI to the Avaya box, then the Avaya box routes the call back to Asterisk, and Asterisk routes it to the SIP phone. As we get more and more users switched over, it will use up more and more channels over the PRI card. Is there a way I can ask Asterisk to check it's local extensions first--then forward off to the Avaya system if it starts with '_9XXX'?

1293434,Integrate a general menu in my asp.net mvc solution,"For my learning, I'm building a document management solution with ASP.NET MVC3.

So wherever the user is located in the website, the treeview menu is showing his location by underlining his location in the menu. For building the treeview menu, I use the code below (cleaned for easy reading): The problem is that I need to underline the active item in my menu. So if user is displaying the search page, my search menu entry must be underlined. How can I proceed? I was thinking about the integration of this information in the strongly typed viewmodel passed to each viewpage but it failed because each page is using a different viewmodel. I prefer not using a session variable because it is not a clean solution. Any ideas? A solution with a session variable: I save the ""current menu item"" in a session variable (from my controller). So, whenever the Site.Master page is reloaded, it recreate every treeview menu item. For each one, it checks if the item is equal to the session variable. If yes, the class ""selected"" is added to the item (css highlighted with blue). I don't really like using session variables.

You can incrementally test of membership in each set whilst composing the result or you can compute the union of three neighbor shells and use intersection to remove the previous two shells leaving the outermost one. In practice, solutions that require the construction of large intermediate sets are slower.

1425526,"What kind of ""zombie"" an app might return from the background?","Currently, I'm building my first app for the app store therefore I have read here, that an app should use less than 30 MB of RAM (iPhone 3G, iPhone 4). I have read that, at some point in time, iOS will start hunting for the resources by randomly killing and freeing sounds, images and other resources from the background apps. Currently, my app uses ~5MB of live bytes that are showed in instruments but I feel some paranoia about memory :) Am I safe when app uses less that 10MB when targeting iPhone3G and iPhone4? The question is if an app goes to background then how much of resources iOS can free of it until finally killing it? If my app goes to background and then 100 or more others apps will be launched then what happens to my app? I do not believe that RAM memory piece is static for my app because the memory in each device is limited. IMHO, if you start looping with opening a new app, sending it to the background, opening another one - then device RAM will be totally used at some point in time. Then, theoretically, if you try to open a new app then some very first opened apps should be killed by iOS... Currently, I'm building small game with pure UIKit, therefore I use a lot of UIView and UIViewImage objects and I'm not sure how to deal with this theoretical situation. During entering the background, my app might gave loaded a lot of in game UIViewImages, pointer to menu MVC and etc. Do I have to code some reloadALL method for reloading every peace of the game?

We use the built in bootstrap capability to use the jQuery load function perform a get request and then insert the response into the bootstrap modal markup. The asp.net web form returns a HTTP Status Code of 204 (no content) on postback this means we can submit the form, the ASP.Net server side click event fires appropriately and the browser does not attempt to render the response. We then close the bootstrap modal with some javascript. This works beautifully on windows in IE10, Firefox, Chrome and Safari. On the iPad however in Safari responds to the 204 status code by rendering the original page markup displayed as text. I have also tried 302 Not Modified, which didn't resolve the problem either (and is not really semantically correct). I have searched for similar problems and only found a reference to an old webkit bug from 2008 where the code was described as rendering a blank page when receiving a 204. Work Around I have also tried setting SuppressContent property of the Response object to true: This does help in that Safari no longer renders the original page markup as text, the bootstrap modal is closed via the javascript call but safari displays the URL for the page that was loaded in the modal in the address bar and behaves like it's loading a page but never does. The user can use the application and request other pages no problems, so we can consider this is a work around. However, I would like to find something cleaner. Any thoughts or suggestions?

If the first query finishes AFTER the second one then the loading icon never goes away. I assume this is because it is never calling the callback. Is there a way that I can cancel the first request once a second request is made?","[""$(function() {\n    var cache = {}, lastXhr;\n\n    $('#Field').autocomplete({\n        minLength: 2,\n        delay: 600,\n        source: function(request, response) {\n            var term = request.term;\n\n            if( term in cache ) {\n                response(cache[term]);\n                return;\n            }\n\n            lastXhr = $.post('LoadData', function(data, status, xhr) {\n                cache[term] = data;\n\n                if(xhr === lastXhr) {\n                    response(data);\n                }\n            });\n        }\n    });\n});\n"", 'if(xhr === lastXhr) {\n    response(data);\n}\n', 'response()']",False

1661080,WatiN SelectList Methods - Page not refreshing/actions not being fired after interacting with a select list,"Preface: If you don't care about the preface, skip down to the section marked ""Question."" Hi, Recently my company has upgraded to the latest version of WatiN for its test automation framework. We upgraded to avoid a problem where interacting with a select list would cause an ACCSES DENIED error. This error seems to be a product of the fact that our web application reloads the page it is on (which sits in a frame which sits in a frameset) with new fields after certain select lists options are selected. It could also be that our framework, which wraps around WatiN, often does actions on the same SelectList after the page refresh (I'm still looking into this, I'm new to the framework). The new version of WatiN does solve the ACCESS DENIED error, but also seems to stop select lists from firing the action that causes the page to reload w/ its new options. In fact, if you use WatiN to make the selection, the select list won't work correctly, even if manually interacted with, until the page has been forced to refresh. Question: When selecting an option in a SelectList using the newest WatiN code, the event that causes our web app's page to reload with new fields/values does not execute. What are some possibilities that could cause this? The term i've seen used most often to describe the refreshing that occurs when our select lists are used is ""double post-back"".

1678191,Which trigonometric identities involve trigonometric functions?,"Once upon a time, when Wikipedia was only three-and-a-half years old and most people didn't know what it was, the article titled functional equation gave the identity $$ \sin^2\theta+\cos^2\theta = 1 $$ as an example of a functional equation. In this edit in July 2004, my summary said ""I think the example recently put here is really lousy, because it's essentially just an algebraic equation in two variables."" (Then some subsequent edits I did the same day brought the article to this state, and much further development of the article has happened since then.) The fact that it's really only an algebraic equation in two variables, $x^2+y^2=1$, makes it a lousy example of a functional equation. It doesn't really involve $x$ and $y$ as functions of $\theta$, since any other parametrization of the circle would have satisfied the same equation. In a sense, that explains why someone like Norman Wildberger can do all sorts of elaborate things with trigonometry without ever using trigonometric functions. But some trigonometric identities do involve trigonometric functions, e.g. $$ \sin(\theta_1+\theta_2)=\sin\theta_1\cos\theta_2+\cos\theta_1\sin\theta_2 $$ $$ \sec(\theta_1+\cdots+\theta_n) = \frac{\sec\theta_1\cdots\sec\theta_n}{e_0-e_2+e_4-e_6+\cdots} $$ where $e_k$ is the $k$th-degree elementary symmetric polynomial in $\tan\theta_1,\ldots,\tan\theta_n$. These are good examples of satisfaction of functional equations. So at this point I wonder whether all trigonometric identities that do seem to depend on which parametrization of the circle is chosen involve adding or subtracting the arguments and no other operations. In some cases the addition or subtraction is written as a condition on which the identity depends, e.g. $$ \text{If }x+y+z=\pi\text{ then }\tan x+\tan y+\tan z = \tan x\tan y\tan z. $$ QUESTION: Do all trigonometric identities that do involve trigonometric functions, in the sense that they are good examples of satisfaction of functional equations by trigonometric functions, get their non-triviality as such examples only from the addition or subtraction of arguments? Or is there some other kind? And if there is no other kind, can that be proved? Postscript: Wikipedia's list of trigonometic identities is more interesting reading than you might think. It has not only the routine stuff that you learned in 10th grade, but also some exotic things that probably most mathematicians don't know about. It was initially created in September 2001 by Axel Boldt, who was for more than a year the principal author of nearly all of Wikipedia's mathematics articles.",[],False

My understanding is a EC2 instance running Windows is basically a Windows VM, very similar to renting a VPS from a more traditional hosting provider. I don't want to have complex backups, either to administer or to restore - if my restore involves installing SVN, MySQL, Jira, etc on a new box before I can even try to restore the backup then it's not great to me. What I really want is a service which backs up my entire VM... if the PC running the VPS dies then the VM image is installed on a new PC and off we go again. With Amazon being all about flexibility and elasticity, I wondered if they have this service? I can't figure it out from reading their docs.",[],False

1752886,"What is the use case for a ""Mixed"" ASPX+ Portal page template?","Reading this question regarding using portal engine vs. aspx, there is also the option for a ""Mixed"" template which the training defines as: This page template is based on an ASPX page located in the path specified in the File name field. ASPX+ Portal page templates are based on an ASPX page with additional page components that enable the Design tab. What isn't clear is what the use case is for this mixed template. When would you use this versus the other two? Update I read the following in the Developer Training materials: Sometimes, you may need to combine ASPX page templates or external ASPX pages with Portal Engine page templates on a single web site. When developing or maintaining a web site built on ASPX page templates, you must manually modify the code of a page every time you want to change its design. But you can add flexibility to ASPX templates by defining areas that can be edited directly through the browser using the CMS administration interface (similar to the Portal Engine development model). This explains clearly that it is a true hybrid where you have both ASPX template and Portal Engine functionality, but it isn't clear what benefit you have by using this approach versus a Portal Engine template that utilizes widgets or web parts.",[],False

In SQL a HAVING clause gets you most of the way there. In the CRM SDK it's going to be a bit harder, and I bet there will be a load more data sent over the network just for the CRM server to process.

1933984,MVC application. How does mult-tier architecture fit in?,"I am new to the concept of MVC and multi-tiered web architecture. I developing a PHP application and am using one of the available MVC frameworks. My question is as follows: From what I understand, MVC in and of itself is not considered a multi-tier architecture. I can understand how using MVC alone is a step up from taking an unstructured approach, but I was contemplating how a simple 3-tier architecture would fit in? Would MVC reside in the presentation layer? What are the merits of adding a tiered approach? From what I gather, with MVC alone there are no explicit data objects responsible for retrieving data from the database and this is usually stuffed into the model. Likewise the business logic, which in a 3-tiered architecture would reside in a 'business-layer' (or whatever you want to call it), can be stuffed into the controller. Is my understanding somewhat correct? I know I asked a lot of questions, but I would like to hear you discuss how you incorporated an n-tier architecture into your MVC framework (PHP or otherwise) as I assume that the two are not mutually exclusive.

2053503,Rails: Where to start? <Big City Without a Roadmap>,"So, I'm still a young developer, but I am trying to endeavour into Rails and server side development. Up until now, I have only ever worked on native application programming (iOS, OSX, JAVA (.jar), etc.). I jumped into a few Ruby tutorials and then Rails tutorials. I found it straightforward to go through the Ruby tutorials as Ruby has an awesome syntax, but when I jumped into the Rails tutorials, most of it assumed having knowledge about HTML (I have a basic understanding, but not much that I can credit) and other web components. It felt overwhelming, however I was fine to go through just understanding the rails part of the tutorial. All this being said, I don't know what to do to continue learning rails from here on out. I feel like I'm in a huge city without a good roadmap, so I am trying to ask the pedestrians/cityfolk (you guys!) what I should be doing now. I would love to be able to just write up rails applications without having to build a website along with it (just simple API calls for some of my applications even). However, everything about this is foreign to me and I would just like to know where I need to go from here. If this isn't the right place to ask a question like this, I'm sorry! Hopefully someone can direct me to an appropriate site, if thats the case. Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated! EDIT I have provided an answer myself that I believe to be a solid solution to my own problem. If people could let me know the validity and worthiness of my answer, it would be greatly appreciated.

Specifically, the following css ceases to be written (this is created by galleria jQuery): For the life of me, I can't figure out why the gallery fails when it's div is set to display: none. Since this declaration is overwritten when a tab is clicked (via the Javascript functions above), why would this cause a problem?

2284333,Multiple event handlers created when reopening fancyBox,"On the calling page, I bind my fancyBox using an href, like so: In myContent.cfm, a default ""filter"" is built, which has add and delete buttons. Something like this: When the addFilter button is clicked, a new ""default"" filter is added to the dom after the filter that was clicked, using consecutive ids. Conversely, clicking the deleteFilter button causes that filter to be deleted and all remaining filters to have their ids renumbered; with the exception that there must be one filter remaining. My original code used .live() to attach event handlers to the newly created elements, like so: After the user has created all the ""filters"" they need, they may either ""apply"" them, which closes the fancybox and reloads a grid with the new, filtered parameters, or simply cancel and close the fancybox. This all works fine the first time, and on reopening the fancybox, the initial blank filter's add button works as expected. However, after adding a second filter, any filter that was added to the dom has multiple event handlers added to the addFilter and deleteFilter buttons. If I added one filter the first time, then return to the fancybox the second time, then add a filter by clicking on the default filter's add button, then click on the newly created filters add button, two more filters are added. If I close, reopen the fancybox a second time, add a filter, and click on that filters add button, three more filters are added. So here's what I've tried so far: 1) Changing the .live() calls to 2) Putting the code to create the filters into a function, which at the end uses .bind() to add the event handlers to the newly created filters; followed by using on closing the fancybox. 3) Using .live() ONLY on the newly created filter elements, and a regular click handler on the default element 4) Upgrading jQuery to 1.8.3 from our current version 5) Calling .remove() on all elements inside the fancybox .onClosed function (although I was under the impression that closing fancybox does actually remove the elements from the dom).

Now, having executable ffmpeg from this project: https://github.com/guardianproject/android-ffmpeg-java there is a problem: The library needs root access but i don't have it. I want my app work on most android apps. In order to execute ffmpeg, i do: Expecting to run ffmpeg command. I get the following error: In test directory there is a video.mp4 file, which is a valid file. The directory also contains ffmpeg binary compiled for arm with ndkr8b from this source: https://github.com/guardianproject/android-ffmpeg Is there any way to use compiled ffmpeg in applications, can i set some permissions in AndroidManifest etc. without su?","['Collect2: cannot find ld', '    String path = ( Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() ).getAbsolutePath();\nString ffmpegBin = path+""/test/ffmpeg"";\nString komenda = ffmpegBin+"" -vframes 1 -ss 10 -i video.mp4 -f image2 -vcodec mjpeg ""+path+""/test/frame%d.jpg"";\nRuntime rt = Runtime.getRuntime();\ntry {\n    Process proc = rt.exec(""chmod 700""+ffmpegBin);\n    rt.exec(ffmpegBin,null,null);\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    // TODO Auto-generated catch block\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n', '   01-21 15:29:24.129: W/System.err(10051): java.io.IOException: Error running exec().

2396990,abort image loading in ImageFlow?,"Finn Rudolph's ImageFlow.js is a wicked clever library. This may be a general javascript question inasmuch as I have an oncontextmenu event that (among other things) removes an instance of ImageFlow and creates a new one with a different set of images on rightClick or commandClick. My problem is that once the original instance starts loading images, it continues until it's done, even if the dom structure created for it is removed. This means my new instance can't start loading until the old one finishes. Does anybody know of a way to abort the image loading? thanks, Jon",[],False

2414482,Windows 2003 GPO Software Restrictions,"We're running a Terminal Server farm in a Windows 2003 Domain, and I found a problem with the Software Restrictions GPO settings that are being applied to our TS servers. Here are the details of our configuration and the problem: All of our servers (Domain Controllers and Terminal Servers) are running Windows Server 2003 SP2 and both the domain and forest are at Windows 2003 level. Our TS servers are in an OU where we have specific GPO's linked and have inheritance blocked, so only the TS specific GPO's are applied to these TS servers. Our users are all remote and do not have workstations joined to our domain, so we don't use loopback policy processing. We take a ""whitelist"" approach to allowing users to run applications, so only applications that we approve and add as path or hash rules are able to run. We have the Security Level in Software Restrictions set to Disallowed and Enforcement is set to ""All software files except libraries"". What I've found is that if I give a user a shortcut to an application, they're able to launch the application even if it's not in the Additional Rules list of ""whitelisted"" applications. If I give a user a copy of the main executable for the application and they attempt to launch it, they get the expected ""this program has been restricted..."" message. It appears that the Software Restrictions are indeed working, except for when the user launches an application using a shortcut as opposed to launching the application from the main executable itself, which seems to contradict the purpose of using Software Restrictions. My questions are: Has anyone else seen this behavior? Can anyone else reproduce this behavior? Am I missing something in my understanding of Software Restrictions? Is it likely that I have something misconfigured in Software Restrictions? EDIT To clarify the problem a little bit: No higher level GPO's are being enforced. Running gpresults shows that in fact, only the TS level GPO's are being applied and I can indeed see my Software Restictions being applied. No path wildcards are in use. I'm testing with an application that is at ""C:\Program Files\Application\executable.exe"" and the application executable is not in any path or hash rule. If the user launches the main application executable directly from the application's folder, the Software Restrictions are enforced. If I give the user a shortcut that points to the application executable at ""C:\Program Files\Application\executable.exe"" then they are able to launch the program. EDIT Also, LNK files are listed in the Designated File Types, so they should be treated as executable, which should mean that they are bound by the same Software Restrictions settings and rules.",[],False

2442547,Getting Invalid Address with javax.mail when the addresses are fine,"I'm using the javax.mail system, and having problems with ""Invalid Address"" exceptions. Here's the basics of the code: The issue is that the above code does work, sometimes. But for some e-mail addresses that I know to be valid (because I can send to them via a standard e-mail client), the above code will throw an ""Invalid Address"" exception when trying to send. Any clues or hints would be greatly appreciated. --Update: problem with authentication. Ok, here's what I've discovered was going on. When receiving e-mail, the code above correctly sets up authentication and the Authenticator.getPasswordAuthentication() callback is actually invoked. Not so when sending e-mail. You have to do a bit more. Add this: which will force the javax.mail API to do the login authentication. And then use an actual Transport instance instead of the static .send() method: ... Without forcing the authentication, the mail server saw me as an unauthorized relay, and just shut me down. The difference between the addresses that ""worked"" and the addresses that didn't was that the ones that ""worked"" were all local to the mail server. Therefore, it simply accepted them. But for any non-local ""relay"" addresses, it would reject the message because my authentication information hadn't been presented by the javax.mail API when I thought it would have.

2447847,"Javascript, Jquery, Cross browser issues, Frustration","I am a predominantly PHP developer. I realize in this day and age specialization in one scripting language doesn't cut it, but the fact remains that my skills at JavaScript and jQuery are pretty green. I am a novice at best. I can create my own code but Cross Browser compatibility remains a huge issue with my work in JavaScript. Anyway, I have a script that filters products according to categories/subcategories. This is how it works: you select a category and the javascript in the background does its thing to filter the subcategories so that the options displayed are the ones pertaining to the parent category- a combination of these two filters the product line. Here is my code: This code is pretty self explanatory I would say. I also have a shiftfocus function that shifts the focus from the current option selected in the subcategory to the default one which is 'none' whenever a new category is picked. This basically resets the subcategory.. here's the code: Shiftfocus is called onChange and scategories is called onClick. Problem 1: 1) Firefox: Shiftfocus doesn't shift the focus to the default option even though I can see it adds the 'selected' attribute. 2) Safari: Does not work at all. EDIT: Problem 2 was the product of a careless mistake. I left open an anchor tag which was creating havoc in IE. Should have double checked before bothering you guys. Sorry. Problem 1 still persists. Problem 2: I understand none of us developers particularly like internet explorer. But I am willing to believe I have made a mistake here. I have some jQuery that fetches data from a script in another file via the native POST function and appends it to a table with the id ""content"". This works fine on every browser, except IE.

2505599,How to pass message and data from method,"I'm a mostly self taught programmer and one aspect I've never really understood is how to return data (term used loosely) and a status message from a method. For example, say I have a method that takes a search term and returns the result of a query. If the caller gets an empty dataset back, how would it know if it's empty because there are no matches or empty because there was an error in the connection to the database. I've used APIs where an out or ref parameter was used, but it seems less than ideal. Perhaps this is the whole point of exceptions. The method would throw an exception if it can't connect to the db, so the caller would know if it received no results and no exceptions then there were simply no results. Would I create my own object that contained both the data an a status message? Maybe I'm overthinking this or am missing some fundamental point of OOP. I'm looking to understand what the best way of returning status or error messages AND data from a method.

I have a ""data"" partition for large files and stuff. Here's what my hard drive looks like in Disk Utility (linux): In LTR order: System Reserved | Windows partition (C:/) ""sda2"" | Data partition ""Data"" | ArchLinux partition ""sda4"" VirtualBox is installed on both OS's, I keep all my VDI files on the Data partition and point VirtualBox to those VDI files. I have only two virtual machines; a Windows XP and a CentOS machine. I actually have 2 copies of the Windows XP VDI, one for accessing from Windows 7 the other from Linux. The problem 5m to boot up as opposed to the normal 30s or so. All operations on the machine are slow aswell, even just moving the mouse is laggy. What I've tried (all of which result in the same laggy performance) Deleting all the vbox files, leaving only the .vdi file (on my Data drive) and then recreating the virtual machine using the same .vdi Throwing loads of RAM (2Gb) and video memory (the maximum allowed) at the VM Changing settings I thought would effect the performance Installing the Guest Additions and restarting the VM Creating a new virtual machine with a new disk altogether, then booting up with the same CentOS LiveCD that I used to install it originally Restarting the laptop and doing most of the above from Windows host I was completely confused. I'd established that the VDI file was not corrupt by creating a completely new one and experiencing the same slowness. I'd eliminated a potential host OS issue because it had the same performance from the Windows host. The only thing I could think of was that my Data drive was somehow corrupt. So I then tried to prove this, by loading up my Windows XP VM from both Linux and Windows host (remember that the Windows vdi file is on the same partition). Oddly, it was absolutely fine and unchanged. Now I'm really confused. Not a corrupt VDI. Not a corrupt hard drive. Not a corrupt virtualbox installation (I did do a package reinstall on Linux host but not Windows).

Result: no problem at all, totally smooth. [Scratches head for about half an hour] Next stage - I'm going at it guns blazing now - backup Data drive, format it to NTFS with Disk Utility, then try again with a fresh CentOS virtual machine. Result: same slow performance issue. [Feels like crying] I have pasted the output of the log file for running CentOS from ArchLinux here.

2656954,Short Lifing CRLs for NPS EAP-TLS Authentication?,"I got a question which i'm unable to find an answer for on any official MS ressource. Image a CA with realy short lifing CRLs (like 1 day). The CA is used only for two purposes: creating NPS certificates for a NPS server and computer certificates for a small bunch of computers which authenticate on WiFi using EAP-TLS. We're using the short lifing CRLs so a OSCP Server is not needed. The CRLs are distributed internally (meaning: inside the corp network) only using LDAP and HTTP. Is my assumption right, that a client which wasn't attached to the network for more then 1 day + CRL renewal period would be unable to authenticate against the WiFi without certificate errors? AFAIK, when connecting to the WiFi, the client would try to check its own and also the NPS certificate of the NPS server which it's using to auth in WiFi. While checking, one step is to check the CRL status. The frist step here it to look up the cached CRL IF it's still valid. However: since the client was absent from network for more then 1 day and ""missed"" to update the CRL, the cached CRL is invalid. Thus the client would try to update it's CRL using the only internally availible LDAP / HTTP CRL DPs. But because we're not on the network yet, this would fail. Even OSCP would be no help here, since at this point in time we have no network at all and thus also no public network which could be used for hosting a OSCP server. Since the cached CRL is not valid and a new CRL is unable to be downloaded, the certificate check of the own and the NPS server certificate would fail on the local client, resulting in either: a. no network connection at all b. a certificate warning which prompts the user Question: Is my assumtion right and how does one handle this szenario in RL?",[],False

To me, this seems like a good idea, because I am protecting my private key by keeping it off the PC, so if the machine is compromised the key (and hence the certificate) will still be safe. It also seems better than the alternative of using a passphrase, because I would not need to re-enter the passphrase at every server restart. So, I would guess many people running web servers would like to do this. If that is true, why is it that I cannot seem to make IIS able to do this? It will not see the certificate, unless I copy it to the ""Local Machine"" certificate store using the MMC ""Certificates"" snap-in, but when I try to use it then I get the error ""A specified logon session does not exist. It may already have been terminated (Exception from HRESULT 0x80070520)."" Lots of Googling only turns up results related to client certificates, which is not what I'm after. Can IIS not do this?

2693638,JTA Timeout with nothing to commit,"I have a very basic JTA question. We are using Spring's AOP to apply WebLogicJtaTransactionManager pointcuts on any method in a service class...and we set the tx:method timeout=""60"". What is interesting is within that service, we run a select statement to retrieve records from the database (using Hibernate/JPA) and then go do some work that is not database/transactional related. That method takes longer than 60 seconds to run and a timeout exception is never thrown and the transaction is never rolled back. We don't update or create new objects to persist. To add to that, we have JTA configured to timeout after 180 seconds on WebLogic Server...and the application still doesn't timeout. The WLS docs say ""The transaction timeout in seconds. If the transaction is still in the ""active"" state after this time (counting from begin()), it is automatically rolled back. Once the transaction moves on to the prepared state, however, this timeout parameter does not apply; the transaction is retried until all the resources are committed."" Would this behavior be related to the fact that there is nothing for the JTA to commit and therefore the timeout doesn't necessarily apply? Or does it related to the fact that because there is no real database (insert/update/deletes) so the transaction is never in a true active state?",[],False

2922557,Is there an alternative to using ResultSet of one statement as format string parameters to execute another statement,"PostgreSQL 9.2, jdbc4, and the DBMS is through PgAdmin3. I need to retrieve some resultset with a statement object which is a callable object with a stored function and then process the types through comparison of those resultset types. After I process them I hope to set some of them as format string arguments for another statement. This is some pseudocode of sorts for what I want to accomplish. Essentially I want to iteratively add to batch and then do a batch update with a savepoint or rollback and commit those changes after executing that batch. In addition there are some postgres in stored procedures as a string for jdbc related syntax I am uncertain of as far as using IS NULL, escaping quotes, requiring a semi-colon, etc. Is it possible in this case to mix and match prepared statements, callable statements, or statements? I know you can only have one resultset per statement open until you execute that statement, but how do I keep the resultset's type objects (i.e. getXXX and store it as some data type) to use on another statement if it closes? This is for an application that will first use a select to retrieve data, then three updates. All three will be batch updates with varying parameters which will iterate through rows of a database, all on separate transactions with commits after each update. Each update will be a separate function. I was originally thinking about using the resultset of one statement and then using updateXXX and updateRow, but I'm not entirely sure about the efficiency.","['String SQL = ""UPDATE AdminBoundaries SET \\""WIKI_URL\\"" = ?"";\nStatement stmt = conn.createStatement();\nstmt.execute(""CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION refcursorfunc() RETURNS refcursor AS \'""\n        + "" DECLARE ""\n        + ""    mycurs refcursor; ""\n        + "" BEGIN ""\n        + ""    OPEN mycurs FOR SELECT \\""NAME_5\\"", \\""NAME_4\\"", \\""NAME_3\\"", \\""NAME_2\\"", \\""NAME_1\\"", \\""NAME_0\\"", \\""WIKI_URL\\"", \\""LEVEL_DEPT\\"" FROM""\n        + "" AdminBoundaries WHERE \\""WIKI_URL\\"" IN(SELECT \\""WIKI_URL\\"" FROM AdminBoundaries""\n        + "" GROUP By \\""WIKI_URL\\"" HAVING (count (\\""WIKI_URL\\"") &gt; 1)) ORDER BY \\""WIKI_URL\\"";; ""\n        + ""    RETURN mycurs; ""\n        + "" END;\' language plpgsql"");\n\nconn.setAutoCommit(false);\nCallableStatement funct = conn.prepareCall(""{ ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?,? = call refcursorfunc()}"");\nfunct.registerOutParameter(1, java.sql.Types.VARCHAR);\nfunct.registerOutParameter(2, java.sql.Types.VARCHAR);\nfunct.registerOutParameter(3, java.sql.Types.VARCHAR);\nfunct.registerOutParameter(4, java.sql.Types.VARCHAR);\nfunct.registerOutParameter(5, java.sql.Types.VARCHAR);\nfunct.registerOutParameter(6, java.sql.Types.VARCHAR);\nfunct.registerOutParameter(7, java.sql.Types.VARCHAR);\nfunct.registerOutParameter(8, java.sql.Types.INTEGER);\nfunct.execute(); \nResultSet results (ResultSet) funct.getObject(1);\nwhile(results.next()){\nString base_url = ""http://127.0.0.1/mediawiki/index.php/"";\nString name0 = rs.getString(""NAME_0"");\nString name1 = rs.getString(""NAME_1"");\nString name2 = rs.getString(""NAME_2"");\nString name3 = rs.getString(""NAME_3"");\nString name4 = rs.getString(""NAME_4"");\nString name5 = rs.getString(""NAME_5"");\nString wiki_url = rs.getString(""WIKI_URL"");\nint level = rs.getInt(""LEVEL_DEPT"");\n}\nPreparedStatement pstmt = null; \npstmt = conn.prepare(SQL, ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE,ResultSet.HOLD_CURSORS_OVER_COMMIT, ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE);\nif(wiki_url.equals(somestring)){\nif(name1 == null){\n  if(level != 0){\n    pstmt.setString(1, somestring + name1);\n    pstmt.addBatch();\n\n    if(name2 == null ){\n\n      ...etc.\n\n     }\n\n       }\n    //either executeUpdate or executeBatch\n    conn.commit()\n    pstmt.clearBatch()\n    conn.setAutoCommit(true);\n }\n']",False

3067980,Programmatically registering a performance counter in the registry,"I'm trying to register a performance counter and part of this process includes adding some textual descriptions to a specific registry key. For English this key is HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Perflib\009 which apparently is also known as HKEY_PERFORMANCE_TEXT. There are a pair of values under there (Counter, Help) that have REG_MULTI_SZ data, and I need to modify them to accomplish my goal. The official way of doing this is by using a tool called lodctr along with a .h and .ini file. There is also a function for doing this programmatically, but my understanding is that it is just a simple wrapper around calling the lodctr program. I found the prospect of maintaining, distributing, and keeping synchronized 3 separate files a bit cumbersome, so I previously wrote code to do this and it worked fine under Windows XP (and possibly Vista, though I don't remember for sure). Now I'm trying to use the same code on Windows 7 and it doesn't work. The problem is that whenever I try to set the registry values it fails with ERROR_BADKEY; even regedit fails to modify the values, so it's not a problem with my code. I ran Process Monitor against it and noticed that there was no activity at the driver level, so it seems this access must be getting blocked in user-mode code (e.g. advapi32.dll or wherever). I understand why Microsoft would try to prevent people from doing this as it is very easy to screw up, and doing so will screw up the entire performance counter collection on the machine. I'm going to debug lodctr and see what the magic is purely out of curiosity, but I'm wondering if anybody has run into this before? Are there any alternatives other than the lodctr utility? Perhaps calling the NT registry API directly? I would really prefer to avoid the hassle of the lodctr method if possible. A minimal example to reproduce the issue: EDIT 1: I spent about an hour or so trying to debug the official APIs and couldn't figure it out so I tried some more Google. After a while I came across this KB article which explains the RegSetValueEx behavior. Since it mentioned modifying system files that got me to thinking that perhaps this particular registry data is backed by a mapped file. Then I came across another KB article that mentions Perfc009.dat and Perfh009.dat in the system32 folder. Opened these up in a hex editor and sure enough it is the raw REG_MULTI_SZ data I am trying to modify. Now that I know that maybe I can take another look and figure it out, though I am bored with it for now.","['HKEY hKey = NULL;\nLONG nResult = RegOpenKeyEx(HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, _T(""SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows NT\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Perflib\\\\009""), 0, KEY_ALL_ACCESS, &amp;hKey);\nif(ERROR_SUCCESS == nResult)\n{\n    LPCTSTR lpData = _T(""bar"");\n    DWORD cbData = (_tcsclen(lpData) + 1) * sizeof(TCHAR);\n    nResult = RegSetValueEx(hKey, _T(""foo""), 0, REG_SZ, (const BYTE*)lpData, cbData);\n    // here nResult == ERROR_BADKEY\n    RegCloseKey(hKey);\n    hKey = NULL;\n}\n']",False

3128790,How to interact with client threads from the server process in Python Tornado,"I've got a python daemon which, using the threading module, is forking off a number of Tornado instances on different ports. Right now, it's just forking off one instance. A client will connect to the instance and register itself, waiting for instructions. At certain intervals, the daemon will have to send data to the Tornado instance, at which time the Tornado instance will send that data to the appropriate registered clients. Right now when I try to call methods within the application object, they are a separate instance than the instance which forks off when the client connects. Therefore the Tornado instance thinks there are no clients when the daemon calls it, but from the client end I can trigger and receive notifications just fine (same instance). To summarize, with this call from the TornadoInstance (at the bottom of the pasted code): I cannot see any registered callbacks in the Client object. However when the client.sendText() function is called from a Handler, it sees the callbacks in the Client object. Here's what I have so far: When the daemon calls the TornadoInstance.send_updates() function, the client function has 0 callbacks. Even though I know clients have registered on the front end. When the clients make a call to /notify/send the proper number of callbacks exist. How can I get the daemon to trigger a notification to all registered clients?","['self.application.client.sendText()\n', 'import threading\nimport tornado.ioloop\nimport tornado.web\nimport tornado.options\nfrom uuid import uuid4\nimport json\n\nclass Client(object):\n    callbacks = {}\n    chat_text = \'\'\n\n    def register(self, callback, session, logon=False):\n        self.callbacks[session] = callback\n        if logon == \'1\':\n            self.notifyCallbacks()\n\n    def notifyCallbacks(self):\n        result = {}\n        result[\'clientCount\'] = self.getClientCount()\n        if self.chat_text:\n            result[\'chatText\'] = self.chat_text\n\n        for session, callback in self.callbacks.iteritems():\n            callback(result)\n\n        self.callbacks = {}\n\n    def sendText(self, session, text):\n        self.chat_text = text\n        self.notifyCallbacks()\n        self.chat_text = \'\'\n\n    def getClientCount(self):\n        return len(self.callbacks)\n\nclass Application(tornado.web.Application):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.client = Client()\n        handlers = [\n            (r""/notify"", MainHandler),\n            (r""/notify/listen"", ListenHandler),\n            (r""/notify/send"", SendHandler)\n        ]\n        settings = dict(\n            cookie_secret=""43oETzKXQAGaYdkL5gEmGeJJFuYh7EQnp2XdTP1o/Vo="",\n            template_path=""templates"",\n        )\n        tornado.web.Application.__init__(self, handlers, **settings)\n\nclass ListenHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):\n    @tornado.web.asynchronous\n    def get(self):\n        logon = self.get_argument(\'logon\')\n        session = self.get_argument(\'session\')\n        self.application.client.register(self.on_message, session, logon)\n\n    def on_message(self, result):\n        json_result = json.dumps(result)\n        self.write(json_result)\n        self.finish()\n\nclass SendHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):\n    def post(self):\n        text = self.get_argument(\'text\')\n        session = self.get_argument(\'session\')\n        self.application.client.sendText(session, text)\n\nclass MainHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):\n    def get(self):\n        session = uuid4()\n        client_count= self.application.client.getClientCount()\n        self.render(""testpage.html"", session=session, clientCount=client_count)\n\nclass TornadoInstance(threading.Thread):\n    def __init__(self, host, port):\n        threading.Thread.__init__(self)\n        self.host = host\n        self.port = port\n        self.application = Application()\n\n    def run(self):\n        self.application.listen(self.port)\n        tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.instance().start()\n\n    def send_updates(self):\n        self.application.client.sendText(0, \'UPDATE from core\')\n']",False
3128902,"How to decide whether to use a RDBMS, Doc/Obj ODBMS or Graph?","What I intend to design basically boils down to a list of users, organisations, events, addresses and comments which could quite easily be maintained in a RDBMS such as MySQL. However, if the project takes off I want to add another aspect which is resources - i.e. files, videos, images etc which can belong to either a user, organisation or event. This instantly raises the question of whether to use a RDBMS and store a reference to an external file through a table related to each of the categories previously mentioned or whether to use a Doc/Obj ODBMS such as MongoDB to store these items. But I also want to be able to link users, organisations and events. i.e. User A owns Org 1 and Org 2. User B owns Org 3 and Org 4. User C owns Org 5. Org 1 has an Event X, held at Addr M on Date R, which Org 3 will also be at. User C intends to attend Event X. Org 2 also has an Event Y at Addr M but on Date T. etc etc. As such, I would suspect that a Graph DBMS such as OrientDB would be the best solution. Either that, or I would have a lot of tables in a RDBMS with a lot of joins, and potentially a lot of queries, or a very strange structure in a Doc/Obj DBMS. I've looked at InfoGrid, which is a Graph database that can connect to MySQL, which could be a potential way to skin this cat. Has anybody else attempted anything like this? What are your thoughts on how to implement such a system, which needs to be scalable? Suggestions are greatly appreciated.",[],False

3133407,Programatically configure individual WCF operations with different WCF configurations,"I am just getting started with WCF and would like to set up a distributable networked system as follows: (but am not sure if it is possible.) I have a .net client that has business logic. It will need various data from various sources so I would like to add a 'server' that contains an in-memory cache but also WCF capabilities to send/receive and publish/subscribe from data sources for data that is not cached. I think it should be possible for these server applications to be identical in terms of code, but highly configurable so that requests could be dealt with in a peer to peer fashion, or traditional client-server as required. I think it could be done so that essentially a server sends a request to wherever it has the endpoint configured and gets a response. Essentially a server would be configured as below: The configuration would be stored for each server in app.config and loaded into memory at startup. So each WCF operation would have its own WCF config (in terms of endpoints etc.) and it would send particular requests to different places according to that configuration. From what I have read of WCF I think this is possible. I don't know have enough experience to know if this is a standard WCF pattern that I am describing (if so please let me know). Otherwise, my main question is, how do I programatically configure each operation (as above) in WCF? Please let me know if I have not explained myself clearly.

3160570,How can I show that the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{n(2+(-1)^n)} $ converges or diverges?,"While revising for exams, I came across a question where at the end of it, we had to determine whether the below series was convergent or divergent: $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{n(2+(-1)^n)} $$ Unfortunately, other than knowing that as the series $ \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{n} $ converges, this series will most likely converge as the $(2 + (-1)^n)$ terms are bounded, I can't see a way of using this to determine if it converges or not. Here's a list of some of the other ideas I've tried, which don't seem to get me anywhere: Generalising the series - By this, I mean replacing the $-1$ for $z$ and then try and use the ratio test to see whether $-1$ is inside or outside or on the boundary of the circle of convergence - however, when I did so, I believe that the ratio test is inconclusive for all values of $|z|$, which while disappointing, is an interesting feature of the series. Summation by parts - While this is usually a nice tool to use for when dealing with awkward sums, I can't see any good choice of sequences $ (a_n) $ and $(b_n)$ to choose to use. Summing consecutive terms - By this, I mean evaluating the series by looking at the sum of $$\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{2k}}{2k(2+(-1)^{2k})} + \frac{(-1)^{2k-1}}{(2k-1)(2+(-1)^{2k-1})}$$ $$ \Rightarrow \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2k} - \frac{1}{3(2k-1)}$$ $\quad$ but then as we are left with parts of the harmonic series this doesn't seem like a nice way to $\quad$evaluate it.

3209495,"JMeter CSV Data Set is corrupting Japanese strings stored as proper UTF-8, I get Question Marks instead","I read in search terms from a simple text file to send to a search engine. It works fine in English, but gives me ???? for any Japanese text. Text with mixed English and Japanese does show the English text, so I know it's reading it. What I'm seeing: Input text: Snow Leopard をインストールする場合、新しい Turns into: Snow Leopard ??????????????? This is in my POST field of an HTTP. If I set JMeter to encode the data, it just puts in the percent sequence for question marks. About the Data: The CSV file is very simple in structure. There's only one field / one column, which I name TERM, and later use as ${TERM} I don't really need full CSV because it's only one string per line. There's no commas or quotes. It's UTF-8 and when I run the Unix ""file"" command on the file, it says UTF-8 text. I've also verified UTF-8 in command line and graphical mode on two machines. Interesting note: An interesting coincidence that I noticed: if there are 15 Japanese characters then I get 15 question marks, so at some point it's being seen as full characters and not just bytes. JMeter CSV Dataset Config: Filename: japanese-searches.csv File encoding: UTF-8 (also tried without) Variable names: TERM Delimiter: , Allow Quoted Data: False (I also tried True, different, but still wrong) Recycle at EOF: True Stop at EOF: False Staring mode: All threads A few things I've tried: - Tried Allow quoted Data. It changed to other strange characters. - Added -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 - Tried encoding the POST stage, but it just turned into a bunch of %nn for question marks And I'm not sure how ""debug"" just after the each line of the CSV is read in. I think it's corrupted right away, but I'm not sure. If it's only mangled when I reference it, then instead of ${TERM} perhaps there's some other ""to bytes"" function call. I'll start checking into that. I haven't done anything with the JMeter functions yet. Edited Dec 24: Tweaks: Changed formatting and added bullet points for more clarity. Clarified that the file is UTF-8, and have verified that. A new theory: Is it possible that the Japanese characters are making it through, and the issue is that EVERY SINGLE place that shows them maps them to a ""?"" at DISPLAY TIME only. So even though I've checked in a bunch of places, they all have a display issue just in the UI? Is there a way in JMeter to see the numeric value of a character or string? Actually, to tell JMeter to display the list of Unicode code points? I'll look at my last log files... although I suppose even the server logs could mis-mapped the characters. Also, perhaps when doing variable expansion inside of the text field that I POST, where I reference the ${TERM}, maybe at that point it also maps to question marks, but that the corruption happens at that later point. If that happened, AND it was mis-displayed in the UI, then it might lead to a false conclusion. What I'd really like to do is pause JMeter after the first CSV record, just after that line is loaded, and look at it with a ""data scope"" or byte editor or something. Not sure if this is possible.",[],False

3220027,Datareader skips first result,"I have a fairly complex SQL query that pulls different types of products from a database based on a customer ID. It pulls three different types of products, identified by their unique identifier number ranges (i.e., IDs 1000-1999 are one type of product, 2000-2999 are another, and 3000-3999 are yet another). c.fldCustomer_ID is the only piece of user input that I need, and when I run this query against the database in SQL Server Management Studio Express, it runs fine. However, when I wrap this in a using statement in the web part I am writing in C# for SharePoint, it does not return the first row that it should, instead returning a null value. For instance, if in SSMS I get three results (say, '1001,' '2008,' and 3045') then my datareader will return only two results, with a null value for the first (i.e., 'null,' '2008,' and '3045'). Here is my code in C#: Our SQL profiler shows the same query being passed regardless of if it's done through SSMS or from the web part, except for the literal being used versus the parameter. Also, if I change the parameter to a literal, I have the same result. Is there a discrepancy in the way that C# handles SQL queries as opposed to SSMS, or have I somehow implemented it incorrectly?

Next, when I restart my solution and run it, the system try to recreate the DB and warn me that the name LearningDB is already exist!! How this can be?? I already check in SQL SERVER with Management Studio but didn't found anything!","['&lt;add name=""EntityFrameworkDbContext"" \n     connectionString=""Data Source=.\\SQL2008;Integrated Security=SSPI;Initial Catalog=LearningDB;MultipleActiveResultSets=True;User Instance=true""\n     providerName=""System.Data.SqlClient""/&gt;\n']",False
3307872,Snapping to specific grid positions,"I have a grid system laid out that lets me to snap objects to the grid, and that works perfectly fine, but it's not the behavior I'm looking for in this situation. I couldn't for the life of me put this into words that would make any sense (probably why I'm having trouble wrapping my head around it...) so I figure a picture with the current behavior and expected behavior will do a much better job: The left hand side shows the current behavior (note: the grid system is actually twice as big as the white grid lines shown above. This allows objects to be placed on the grid lines, which is the intended behavior I'm looking for.) The right hand side is how I want objects to snap to the grid. I only want objects to be placed on the grid lines, not on the grid nodes (or the blank center node). In the expected behavior, objects will ALWAYS snap to the grid if the paired value is opposite of it -- if X is ODD, then the Y value must be EVEN for it to snap or vice-versa (i.e. [0, 1], [1, 0], [2,3]). Objects won't snap to [0,0], [1,1], [4, 2] because they're both ODD or both EVEN. Just something I noticed that was consistent with the behavior I was looking for but couldn't translate this into anything useful. Here's the snap to grid code in it's entirety:","['//Grab the mouse state\nMouseState mouse = Mouse.GetState();\n\n//TileX = (int)Math.Floor((float)(mouse.X / tileWidth));  //tileWidth = 80\n//TileY = (int)Math.Floor((float)(mouse.Y / tileHeight)); //tileHeight = 80\n\n//We want ""snap to closest grid space"" instead of ""snap to next-lowest grid space"", \n//like the Math.Floor code does above. The "".ToInt()"" extensions simply rounds a \n//float to the closest integer. i.e. 2.2 = 2     2.5 = 3    3 = 3\nTileX = ((float)mouse.X / tileWidth).ToInt();\nTileY = ((float)mouse.Y / tileHeight).ToInt();\n\n//Set the square to a whole tile coordinate\nsquarePosition.X = TileX * tileWidth;\nsquarePosition.Y = TileY * tileHeight;\n']",False
3310919,How to grab text from each xml tag when the tags have multiple duplications,"Sorry if the question is obscure but this example xml tells it completely.

Current output: Desired output: I know my temp calls and allocation may be wrong, but it is the assigning of the text values within each tag that is the main problem as it only finds the last one. The final solution will need dictionaries at the end for use in other methods and functions.

3336741,How do software projects go over budget and under-deliver?,"I've come across this story quite a few times here in the UK: NHS Computer System Summary: We're spunking £12 Billion on some health software with barely anything working. I was sitting the office discussing this with my colleagues, and we had a little think about. From what I can see, all the NHS needs is a database + middle tier of drugs/hospitals/patients/prescriptions objects, and various GUIs for doctors and nurses to look at. You'd also need to think about security and scalability. And you'd need to sit around a hospital/pharmacy/GPs office for a bit to figure out what they need. But, all told, I'd say I could knock together something with that kind of structure in a couple of days, and maybe throw in a month or two to make it work in scale. * If I had a few million quid, I could probably hire some really excellent designers to make a maintainable codebase, and also buy appropriate hardware to run the system on. I hate to trivialize something that seems to have caused to much trouble, but to me it looks like just a big distributed CRUD + UI system. So how on earth did this project bloat to £12B without producing much useful software? As I don't think the software sounds so complicated, I can only imagine that something about how it was organised caused this mess. Is it outsourcing that's the problem? Is it not getting the software designers to understand the medical business that caused it? What are your experiences with projects gone over budget, under delivered? What are best practices for large projects? Have you ever worked on such a project? EDIT *This bit seemed to get a lot of attention. What I mean is I could probably do this for say, 30 users, spending a few tens of thousands of pounds. I'm not including stuff I don't know about the medical industry and government, but I think most people who've been around programming are familiar with that kind of database/front end kind of design. My point is the NHS project looks like a BIG version of this, with bells and whistles, notably security. But surely a budget millions of times larger than mine could provide this?",[],False
3344075,Why isn't TTL metering accurate when using a non-electronic lens?,"I recently bought a Lensbaby lens and I played with it a lot. Then lens is awesome but I have one big and annoying problem and is that TTL metering fails miserably when using P, TV and M modes. I mean, the picture that the live view shows you is completely different that the one that gets recorded in the SD card. The only mode where the camera meters correctly is in AV, but due to is a semi-automatic mode I have a lot of trouble trying to get the correct shutter speed (I deal with the AE-Lock button but it's very hard to get the number that I specifically want) So, my question is why TTL metering is lost (or gets inaccurate) when using analog lenses (or the ones that don't have any electronic connection with the camera)? What extra information an electronic lens gives to the camera to meter correctly? Why the light coming through the lens isn't enough information in order to meter correctly? Why my camera (Canon 550D) meters correctly in AV mode but not in M mode? How do you deal with it? I tried using different metering modes, but still no luck.

3352558,Confidence Interval Probabilty,"1) We have discovered a new method to produce a liquid containing Zinc. We measure the concentration μ four times independently (from the same solution) and find the values 0.3, 0.33, 0.3, 0.27 a) Assuming that the standard deviation of the measurement error is 0.02 (when we make one measurement) estimate μ and give a 90%-confidence interval. Answer: We assume the measurement errors to be normal with zero expectation. The estimate for μ is $μ_X = (X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4)/4 = (0.3 + 0.33 + 0.3 + 0.27)/4 = 0.3.$ The same procedure as usual leads to a confidence interval $[0.3 - b_\text{standard deviation}/\sqrt{n},\, 0.3 + b_\text{standard deviation}/\sqrt{n}]$ where the standard deviation equals $0.02$ and $\sqrt{n} = 2$, whilst $b$ is defined by the equation $P(−b \leq N(0, 1)\leq b) = 90\%.$ The last equation above is equivalent to $\lambda(b) = 0.95$ which we can solve with the help of a table and find $b = 1.645$. Hence the $90\%$ confidence interval is equal to $[0.3 − 0.0164, 0.3 + 0.0164] = [0.2836, 0.3164]$. The true concentration is thus between $0.2836$ and $0.3164$ with at least $95\%$ probability.

Currently, my threads use Events as data locks an unlocks. I opted to use this over critical sections as most data is only shared between two or three threads so preventing a single thread from reading while one wrote by stopping all 20 threads seemed wasteful. I used Event over Mutex simply due to the fact that I could not (easily) find a source that clearly explained how a Mutex works and how to implement one. I'm using Win32 API for my multi-threading. In my current setup I use Events to lock data so my event would be something like ""DataUnlock"" When not set I know that the data is being worked on. When set I know it is ok to work on the data. So my makeshift data locks look something like this. My first question is: Is this as good (efficient) as using a Mutex when only two threads are accessing the data? Second: If more than two threads waiting to access the data is there a potential that both will be triggered when the data is freed (will the both pass the wait before one reaches ResetEvent)?

3458999,Why does Cantor's Diagonalization work?,"Possible Duplicate: How does Cantor&#39;s diagonal argument work? It seems to me that if you have an infinite list of unending decimal numbers between 0 and 1 (exclusive) and you want to generate a number between 0 and 1 that is not on the list, Cantor's diagonalization does not work. For example, consider where each x can be any value, and y, being the third, must be different from the the third digit in the third number, is any number except the third digit in the third number. In this case, we know our number is different from the third number, and because of how we have been writing it (first two digits are appropriately distinct from the first two numbers), we know it is unique so far on the list. However, because this is an infinite list which claims to contain all real numbers between 0 and 1, the number we have written exists somewhere further down the list. So we continue. We add a fourth digit, which differentiates it from the fourth number in the list. Facing the same problem, we continue to the fifth, then the sixth, and so on... The whole point of this, as I understand it, is to show that we can write a number which is not already in this list. However, at any point, there are an infinite number of numbers left in the list, one of which is equal to what we have written. So we must continue on to infinite... Since we will never reach a point where there are 0 numbers left in the list, we will never finish writing a number which is not on the list. Every digit we add makes it different from more and more numbers on the list, but never from EVERY number on the list. So, in practice, we CAN'T generate a number which is not on the list. This seems to make perfect sense to me, but it also seems to be incorrect.

So, if I pass in a string with a single ""enter-key-press"" it stores a space instead.

3476617,Asp.NET 4.0 Menu control a:active style persisting after mouse released,"I'm using a standard asp.net menu in an asp.net 4.0 web application. To clarify, it's a standard web application, it is not any version of the MVC applications available. This is the problem I'm having. It's a fairly simple setup really. I have css overing the various states of the menu, :link, :visited, :hover and :active. As you would suspect, there are visible differences between these states. In addition, I have some javascript running which highlights the link of the current page, which is another fairly normal activity. Nothing mysterious or obcure so far. The problem comes when people start clicking around on the menu. Lets say you are on the home page. The first menu item is highlighted. Lets say now - for whatever reason only a user can come up with - you click and drag one of the menuitems. It doesn't have to be far, it can be only a millimetre or two. The expected behaviour is that the drag will negate the click, the page will stay where it is and the click-dragged menuitemw ill return to its former state. What actually happens is the drag negates the click, the page stays where it is and the click-dragged menuitem seems to retain the :active style if it exists, or the :hover style if the :active style isn't there. Replication: It would appear this could be a bug in the Asp.Net menu though. To try to replicate the problem outside my project, I created a bog standard Asp.NET Web Application project using the template in VS2010. I changed one line in the Site.css - specifically, I changed the :active style in div.menu ul li a:active to color: red; Then I fired the application up, clicked the Home menu item and dragged it a couple of millimetres. Sure enough, when I let go of the mousebutton, the menu item stuck with the :active style. Testing I originally found the problem in IE8, however it is still there in IE9 as well as in Firefox/Aurora. Chrome and Safari however, revert the menu item back to its intended state, mostly. They both leave a glowy effect around the edges of the element. I haven't tested it in Opera. ....Profit? I've scoured the net looking for a solution to this and just cannot find one. In fact, it's very tough to find a reference to the problem, the closest I came was on one of Sitepoint's reference pages, where it mentions something similar as a bug in IE7. http://reference.sitepoint.com/css/pseudoclass-hover Anyone have any ideas? Code Here is the code in the Site.Master - I've renamed menu items to protect the culpable: While I'm at it, I'll also post the CSS which applies to this menu.

3485392,How expensive are semaphores vs. spin locks in practice?,"This question asks whether a spin lock can be improved in a way that doesn't compromise latency, but uses less CPU time. A large list of answers suggest high level language concepts in C++11, Boost, and the like. My first thought was to use a simple C semaphore, since the poster needs to block only when a buffer is empty or full. In the process of writing up an answer however, I realized I do not know what the overhead of these functions is in practice. Intuitively, it seems like it should be small, and it's never been an optimization issue for me, but perhaps it's substantial vs. a spin lock. Presumably it's also system dependent. Answers to this question suggest that a spin lock is preferred when locking for less than one thread quanta, but no real world indications are given as to why. Answers to this question provide a working example of a semaphore implementation in C++ that uses a spin lock with pthread_wait in the body, but it's not taken from any actual language implementation. Over here, a question about speed differences between a mutex and a semaphore are declared to be insignificant by some. Others say the semaphore is slower. An article linked to by this question suggests that the C# lock command for a mutex costs 50ns in practice on a 2.4GhZ machine (so ~100 cycles). However, it's unclear whether C#'s implementations are representative of say, a straight C implementation of the POSIX semaphore. So, the question is, what's the overhead on semaphore use like in practice, and by extension, when should I prefer a spin lock if all I care about is latency (i.e. not maintainability for some reason)?",[],False

I'd like to cache the calculating of the occurrences taking place, and was thinking I could serialize an array of the occurrences within an events db column. Then I would only need to load the users calendars, and any of the events that have an occurrence within the month. I'm not sure how or even if I can get Thinking Sphinx to search a serialized array though. Is this possible, and how would I define that in my models define_index block? Is there a more efficient way that I can cache / search event occurrence times? Or is there any other solutions people have used to solve a similar issue of searching Arrays of Time objects?",[],False

3555977,StatusBar and RootViewController on iOS 6,"My app has been running fine for a couple years, but there have been several hiccups with the release of iOS 6 and one of them is a problem with StatusBar orientation. My app works in either Landscape orientation, but touches were vertically off by the width of the status bar in one of the two orientations. Intuitively, it seemed that even though the status bar image was being relocated properly during rotation, the LOGICAL position of the status bar was not changing -- and thus consuming touches on the wrong side of the screen. In my Info.plist file ""UIStatusBarHidden"" was set to FALSE. In my App Delegate's ""didFinishLaunchingWithOptions"" function I created my own custom ViewController and set it as the RootViewController for the Window. Even though this worked prior to iOS 6, I believe it is at this point that the StatusBar did not ""transfer"" to the new RootViewController. I theorized that prior to iOS 6 my code worked because orientation changes got propagated to the OLD RootViewController and caused orientation to work as expected. Since iOS 6 no longer propagates orientation beyond the NEW RootViewController, the OLD controller (which ""logically"" contained the StatusBar) never got updated. Note: my app does not have a .XIB file and does not explicitly create a RootViewController until this point. But I think a default one was created for me behind the scenes anyhow. My ""solution"" was to set ""UIStatusBarHidden"" to TRUE in the Info.plist file and manually set it to FALSE in code at a point AFTER I've set my custom RootViewController. This seems to work, but I may have addressed the symptom instead of the actual problem. I'm also worried about side-effects because other things besides StatusBar could still be logically tied to that old/implicit RootViewController and they aren't getting ""transferred"" to the new one either. Does anyone have similar experience with StatusBar and/or RootViewController? Is this approach ok or should I leave the default/implicit RootViewController in place and somehow add my ViewController to it as a child?

EightBitTony, I think I see what your getting at when you say: ""netstat -a shows connected machines, not just the ip address of every machine anywhere"". This outstation device's only job is to come online and send data to our servers. The Ip Address of the device is: 10.113.201.155 and the port number it should connect to is: 6102. When I do a netstat I was expecting it to be connected to this port number (6102) but it is not. 6102 is the port the server software listens on. This outstation has not sent back any data now for the last 2 days which is the problem we are experiencing yet it is pingable suggesting it is online. Unfortunately this device is not located in an office anywhere where I could simply reset it. We are going to have to send a maintenance team out but I wanted to better understand what is going on and why this is happening. I have another question.

3705076,Ruby on Rails use an IDE or stick with a good text editor,"I am an experienced programmer and an enthusiastic new adopter of Ruby on Rails. I'm mostly using a mac, unix, and textMate, to get the job done. I've written some small apps on my own and am excited by the potential to write something more complex. Should I commit time and resources to using (learning) an IDE for RoR? Please respond if you are someone who has used a configuration similar to mine and an IDE for RoR. This is not a question about which IDE is the best, or which platform is preferred for RoR. I'm more concerned with the cost/benefit of committing to any IDE that is built over a broad set of changing and evolving tools. In addition, the detailed understanding of file structure and directory layout that just using a text editor fosters seems like a good skill to continue to grow as I broaden my use of the features in rails. And... HTML, CSS, and ruby, are all well assessed with text editors that have the most basic formatting features. On the plus side, I find IDEs that offer hand holding (templates, autocomplete text, etc.) for generating unit testing (TDD) with RSpec are appealing as this is an area in which I have limited experience. My big worry is that I'll commit to an IDE, write an application, and then get stuck when ruby, rails, or some other key component I am using updates in a way that the IDE folks never anticipated. Using an IDE and periodically editing files or resources outside the particular IDE paradigm has burned me in the past. Previous gotchas have also included language features that an IDE did not account for well, thereby limiting development flexibility. ""remote server"" integration/mirroring and version control are best handled through an IDE interface. git has impressed me as efficient and easy to use. Is there a best approach here for undertaking a larger project, or are both methods O.K. with their associated caveats? Are my concerns about using an IDE outdated or warranted? Thanks in advance for your comments - Perry Addendum: Seems there is some overlap here: Will using an IDE with Rails hinder me? Conclusion: Lots of good food for thought. Thanks all. I am glad I began my Ruby and RoR learning with unix and a text editor. It's a great combo for the text laden environment that RoR lives in. rvm, git, rspec, gem management, and code generation are all well done from a command line. They made working through Hartl's Rails Tutorial, and playing with examples from ""The Well Grounded Rubyist,"" easy. I am going to check out Rubymine's 30-day free trial. I expect the IDE will add to my initial understanding in (+) ways. Integrated unit testing was a big factor in my decision to try the IDE as I have stumbled with Rspec. I don't think my time (or money) have been wasted with textMate. Both were well spent. ADDENDUM 2 I used Ruby Mine for 30 days. It was O.K. I did decide to stick with: MacBook Pro TextMate git ... and they are all very good. I can switch very quickly between testing, coding, browsing, and version control. TextMate's 'Bundles' occasionally help as a CSS, Ruby, and Rails code reference. I might also add that most of my 'troubles' stemmed from thinking I could just pick-up Ruby along the way. Nope. I had to read and experiment and read some more. ""Getting"" Ruby has really opened up Rails for me.

At that point, I had already seen that the infinite square grid (considering only the vertical or horizontal lines as being the ""edges"" of the grid) is Hamiltonian by a simple drawing of two ""concentric"" spirals, as the following figure shows: One of the replies that I received was from David Eppstein, who told me: ""Hint: spiral.""

3751478,Text String with Delegates in VB.Net,"I was assigned the following project for my VB.Net programming course: ""Write a program using various procedures to perform the operations listed below. Call these procedures using delegates. Make sure to document your program and have the program print descriptive text along with the numbers in b. and c. Now this raises a couple of questions that I have (some of which are opinion-based) relating to how I should complete the assignment. First off, what do you guys think my teacher means by ""reverse word order""? Do they mean print a text string with the word compositions going backwards (i.e. ""siht si a ecnetnes""), do they mean print a text string with the whole words going backwards (i.e. ""sentence a is this""), or do they mean both at once (i.e. ""ecnetnes a si siht"")? This is one of the opinion-based questions, but I just wanted your guys' thoughts. Secondly, what is the syntax to produce the number of characters in a string? I already know the code necessary to get the number of words, but part b of this assignment is confusing me slightly. Any help would be greatly appreciated.","['a) Print a text string in reverse word order. \nb) Print the number of characters in the string.\nc) Print number of words in the string.""\n']",False

3813896,Probability of duplicate free sample of iid discrete random sample,"Let $\{X_1,\ldots,X_n\}$ be independent identically distributed discrete random variables. I am interested in computing the probability of the event that the sample is duplicate free: $$ \mathbb{P}\left( \bigcap_{i&lt;j} \{ X_i \not= X_j\}\right) $$ in terms of $p_2 = \mathbb{P}\left(X_1 = X_2\right)$, $p_3=\mathbb{P}\left(X_1 = X_2 = X_3\right)$, ..., $p_n = \mathbb{P}\left(X_1 = X_2 = X_3=\ldots=X_n\right)$. Special case If $X_k$ are uniformly distributed with the size of the sample space being $d$, this is a classic birthday problem with the answer: $$ \mathbb{P}\left( \bigcap_{i&lt;j} \{ X_i \not= X_j\}\right) = \frac{n!}{d^n} \binom{d}{n} = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{s(n,k)}{d^{n-k}} $$ where $s(n,k)$ denotes the Stirling number of the first kind. Motivation Consider IEEE floating point number with mantissa $m$ encoded as $d$-tuple of significant binary digits (i.e. the first bit is always 1), and integer binary exponent $e$. For a random real $0&lt;x&lt;1$, bits are iid Bernoulli(1/2) random variables, and $-e$ is a Geometric(1/2) random variable.

So, in order to get a point of reference, I tried downloading some .js files integrated into HTML pages from various sources. However, this proved to be unhelpful and I am at a loss for understanding because of the way the files are formatted. It seems as if most files put one line of code after the other. I realize that because of flexible whitespace restrictions with JavaScript that this does not hinder the way the code runs, but why did the developers choose to put it all on one line like that? They obviously didn't write the code that way, as that would be extremely tedious and hard to work with, so why did it come out that way when I try to view it?

Unfortunately I'm on a deadline so don't have time to work through a whole book chapter, so I'm hoping for a bit more targeted advice. I want to store some objective-C objects in a C array. I'm using ARC. If I were on the Mac I'd be able to use NSPointerArray instead, but I'm on iOS and that's not available. I'll be storing a three-dimensional C array: conceptually my dimensions are day, height, and cacheNumber. Each element will either be a pointer to an objective-C object, or NULL. The number of caches (i.e. the size of the cacheNumber dimension) is known at compile time, but the other two are not known. Also, the array could be very large, so I need to dynamically allocate memory for it. Regarding ownership semantics, I need strong references to the objects. I would like the whole three-dimensional array to be an instance variable on an objective-C object. I plan to have a method that is . That method should return a two-dimensional array, that is one specific cache number. (It also passes back by reference the size of the array it is returning.) My questions: What order should I put my dimensions so that I can easily return a pointer to the subarray for one specific cache number? (I think it should be first, but I'm not 100%.) What should the return type of my method be, so that ARC doesn't complain? I don't mind if the returned array has an increased reference count or not, as long as I know which it's doing. What type should my instance variable that holds the three dimensional array be? I think it should just be a pointer, since that ivar just represents the pointer to the first item that's in my array. Correct? If so, how do I specify that? When I create the three-dimensional array (for my ivar), I guess I do something like , and cast the result to the type for my ivar? When accessing items from the three-dimensional array in the ivar, I believe I have to dereference the pointer each time, with something like . Correct? Will the two-dimensional array I return from the method be similarly accessed? Do I need to tag the returned two-dimensional array with ?

4083260,"Prevent Internet Explorer from saving files with the ""T"" attribute set","Okay, here's the issue at hand - Internet Explorer is behaving badly (as in the opposite of Google Chrome and FireFox) and when users save an image to our file server, the temp bit is set, so DFS doesn't replicate the file. See this article: http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/406.dfsr-does-not-replicate-temporary-files.aspx The workflow for the issue here is: A staff member receives a file (usually an image) from Outlook or the web. They open the file, it opens in Internet Explorer (version 8). They save the file (ie, to their desktop). For some reason the temp attribute gets set. They copy it to our file server (which is dfs'd). Manager goes to check for it and it doesn't show up. Blame I.T. I did some glancing around on the web, but didn't find quite what I was after. Anyone have a suggestion as to a method that will stop Internet Explorer from marking these files as temporary, even when the user is saving the file to their desktop? Solutions tried: Creating a task that runs the powershell fix for the temp file issue. Have the end user run the fix. Set default program for images to firefox.

4156373,nginx not serving admin static files?,"First, I want to clarify that this error is just for the admin static files. This means my problem is specific just to the static files that corresponds to the Django admin. The rest of the static files are working perfect. Basically my problem is that for some reason I cannot access those admin static files with the ngix server. It works perfect with the micro server of Django and the collect static is doing its job. This means it is putting the files on the expected place in the static folder. The urls are correct but I cannot even access the admin static files directly, but the others I can. So, for example, I am able to access this url (copying it in the browser): myserver.com:8080/static/css/base/base.css but i am not able to access this other url (copying it in the browser): myserver.com:8080/static/admin/css/admin.css I also tried to copy the admin/ directory structure into other_admin_directory_name/. Then I can access myserver.com:8080/static/other_admin_directory_name/css/admin.css Then, it works. So, I checked permissions and everything is fine. I tried to change ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX = '/static/admin/' to ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX = '/static/other_admin_directory_name/', it doesn't work. This a mistery in itself that I am exploring but still no luck. Finally, and it seems to be an important clue: I tried to copy the admin/ directory structure into admin_and_then_any_suffix/. Then I cannot access myserver.com:8080/static/admin_and_then_any_suffix//css/admin.css So, if the name of the directory starts with admin (for example administration or admin2) it doesn't work. * added thanks to sarnold observation ** the problem seems to be in the nginx configuration file /etc/nginx/sites-available/mysite",['location /static/admin {\n   alias /home/vl3/.virtualenvs/vl3/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/contrib/admin/media/;\n}\n'],False

From what I've seen it looks like it's probably the YADIS discovery that is throwing the error, which should be able to be bypassed since the discovery is on Google or Yahoo's end, but I'm not sure. This is all a big informal learning experience for me, and I haven't had any luck finding documentation that can help me on this one. Any tips would be greatly appreciated.

This makes the other list items flow up and reveals the second list item within the wrapper window. When the last list item is visible, the click will show(400) all of the list items again, causing them to flow back into order and only the first item will be showing again. Further clicks will repeat this process from the beginning. I know what I would like to do in terms of code, but I am having trouble with the correct syntax, selectors and refining.

This doc, under the heading ""Going in the wrong direction"", goes on to say, ""values 1: do overcommit, and 0 (default): don't"", but then in the next few lines, it mentions, amongst similar things, that this isn't actually true and that 0 means ""guess about how much overcommitment is reasonable"". That means that memory overcommit isn't disabled using value 0, right? It also says that 1 indicates ""never refuse any malloc()"", with 2 meaning ""be precise about the overcommit - never commit a virtual address space larger than swap space plus a fraction overcommit_ratio of the physical memory."" The Red Hat magazine, on the other hand states, ""if the value is 0, then the kernel checks to determine if there is enough memory free to grant a memory request to a malloc call from an application. If there is enough memory, then the request is granted. Otherwise, it is denied and an error code is returned to the application."" This sounds exactly like disabling overcommit. ""If the value is set to 1, then the kernel grants allocations above the amount of physical RAM and swap in the system as defined by the overcommit_ratio value.... If the setting in this file is 2, the kernel allows all memory allocations, regardless of the current memory allocation state.""

I discovered that there was a 2 hour power outage.

What do you think? Could this be a problem? I have another issue with the UPS. Let's say I'm at the PC and I have a power outage for 30 sec. I decide to put my PC to hibernation manually. The PC has hibernated. The power comes back, I turn on the PC, but in ~30mins, the UPS turns itself off, no warning whatsoever, cutting the power from the PC, too. This is a major no-no.

If I'm writing unit tests for test cases that throw exceptions, do I only care that the correct exception type was thrown, or should I be checking more? Specifically: If I call a method and expect a NullReferenceException, should I inspect that exception and make sure it came from where I'm expecting it to come from? If an exception is thrown, should I immediately not care about state anymore, or is it still valid to make assertions about the state of the system? If I pass nulls into a method, and a NullArgumentException is thrown, do I care for which argument it is thrown, or only that it was thrown? I'm currently of the opinion that once an exception is thrown, all bets are off in terms of system state, and digging deep into exceptions is bad since at that point you're starting to inspect how your method is implemented. thanks, Mark",[],False

4289117,"Jquery XHR which results in a dom change that persists through refreshes, etc","This is more of a design question than technical, but it has me completely stumped. So, I have a webpage (hosted via google app engine) that lists a number of seperate forms (each is a question/puzzle). A single puzzle has a number of text boxes to fill out, as well as a submit button. Upon hitting submit, an ajax request is made to the server (running python) which checks if the answers given were correct. In response, the page updates by adding appropriate ticks and crosses by the relevant text boxes, as well as a medium-opacity overlay that covers the entire question (to give the whole thing a ""greyed out"" effect). When the page is refreshed, these modifications obviously disappear. However, the ajax request saves the answer info to the database. The questions themselves are created by rendering the page using Jinja2. So, all the relevant data is saved so that the next time the user returns to the page, questions he has answered in the past are still greyed out, his answers and tick/crosses still there. However, I can't figure out what the best way to do this would be. Do I hard-code the dom modifications for finished questions using if statements in the jinja2 loop (eg:for each question being created, if it's already been answered then render it differently). Or, would it be better to let the page load normally, and then perform an on-load XHR for each question/form on the page? Really what I want to do is, as each form is rendered in Jinja2, perform an xhr to see if it has an answer in the db, and if so act accordingly. But mixing jinja2 with ajax seems quite messy, surely there is a better way to go about this? Sorry for the long convoluted question, hopefully it's at least comprehensible.",[],False

I use pre-computed LDPI/MDPI/HDPI versions of these bitmaps, e.g. a notification icon that fits the specs for notification icons. I attached two images that show the effect.

Maybe the possibility of $n$ randomly picked numbers are relatively prime to each other(there are two cases here: (1)these $n$ numbers are pairly relatively prime to each other (2)the common divisor of all of these $n$ numbers is 1) equals $1/\zeta (n)$?

4361838,Multi MVC processing vs Single MVC process,"I've worked fairly extensively with the MVC framework cakephp, however I'm finding that I would rather have my pages driven by the multiple MVC than by just one MVC. My reason is primarily to maintain an a more DRY principle. In CakePHP MVC: you call a URL which calls a single MVC, which then calls the layout. What I want is: you call a URL, it processes a layout, which then calls multiple MVC's per component/block of html on the page. When you compare JavaScript components, AJAX, and server side HTML rendering, it seems the most consistent method for building pages is through blocks of components or HTML views. That way, the view block could be situated either on the server or the client. This is technically my ONLY disagreement with the MVC model. Outside of this, IMHO MVC rocks! My question is: What other RAD frameworks follow the same principles as MVC but are driven rather by the View side of MVC? I've looked at Django and Ruby on Rails, yet they seems to be more Controller driven. Lift/Scala appears to be somewhat of a good fit, but i'm interested to see what others exist.",[],False

I make an XMLHTTPRequest and fetch just the contents needed to be replaced (placed in a file call ""xmlres.html"", contains just a single img tag)and also update url using pushstate(). Everything works fine. But the problem is if user tries to copy current url ""appname/b.html"" and open in another page, the resource is not found, as I haven't created ""b.html"". I don't want to create b.html with full contents again, is there any workaround to solve this problem. Should I write any event listeners for URL or how should I proceed. Any insight on this would be great help.",[],False

4459667,"C++0x: conditional operator, xvalues, and decltype","I am reposting a comp.std.c++ Usenet discussion here because that group has become very unreliable. The last few posts I've submitted there have gone into the void, and activity has all but ceased. I doubt I've been banned and/or everyone else just lost interest. Hopefully all interested people will find this discussion, and there will be a general migration. Maybe then they will appoint a new moderator. Hello! With my current interpretation of draft N3126 w.r.t. the conditional operator and xvalues, I expect the following assertions to hold: 5.16/4 says: If the second and third operands [to the conditional operator] are glvalues of the same value category and have the same type, the result is of that type and value category [...] Though, it doesn't clearly say that the resulting glvalue refers to one of the objects the glvalue operands referred to -- or is this implied because otherwise it would return a prvalue? Using GCC 4.5.1 in C++0x mode the second assertion fails. The reference k seems to refer to some temporary object. Can somebody clarify whether the comiler is allowed to create such a temporary in case both operands around the colon are xvalues of the same type? I'm currently assuming GCC is buggy and/or not up-to-date with respect to xvalues. The followup question is: Wouldn't it be nice to be able to detect the value category of an expression? If we ignore the conditional operator we can detect the value category of an expression with decltype. But what is supposed to yield? Using GCC 4.5.1, the xvalue variable is initialized with false. Is this conforming to the current standard draft? TIA, Sebastian","[' int i = 0;\n int&amp; j = true? i : i;\n int&amp;&amp; k = true? std::move(i) : std::move(i);   // #2\n assert(&amp;i == &amp;j); // Holds since C++98\n assert(&amp;i == &amp;k); // Should this hold as well?\n', ' bool xvalue = std::is_rvalue_reference&lt;\n   decltype( true ? std::move(i) : std::move(i) ) &gt;::value;\n']",False

So far so good. With the button wired, the button click posts back to the control as expected. However, the event never makes it back to the page's event handler. I realize the problem is occurring on postback. Yet, attempting to wire the button on init, load or createchildcontrols all fail to keep the wiring in place so the event can be handled on the page. What I would like, is the ability to pass the eventhandler to the composite control during runtime, and for the composite control to send the event correctly back to the page on postback. Interestingly, if I call OnBubble with custom eventargs I can catch the bubbled event on the page. But the problem is that my placeholder is on the page, so when I attempt to call in a UserControl, for example, the bubble goes to the page and not to the UserControl (as expected). Hence, the reason I prefer to declare the eventhandler instead of overriding (UserControls and other controls that declare MyControl would essentially render it useless for button click events). I'm hoping someone has some insight into the problem. It seems like an interesting problem, but perhaps there is no solution outside of declaring the control explicitly on the page, and directly wiring up the event either in the markup or on pageload. I would consider having the button make an asynchronous callback, but would prefer to use standard ASP.NET event handling if possible. Thanks! To add clarification: the call actually generates an event that calls the Composite Control's method. this is all well and good, but it is worth noting that the method does not have direct access to the control. This should make sense because the the control is added to the page on not in markup. More Code: Edit: My attempt to store the eventhandler in the Session and wire up the button on postback was successful. I don't consider this good practice, and I don't think it actually serves my purpose. For example, in this case the event on the page executes as expected, but with non-standard page behavior. For example, Response.Redirect() throws an exception. This should make sense because the eventhandler has probably lost state information during the postback. A couple of thoughts: 1. Is it possible that I could create a custom bubble event that is somehow related to this control? This seems plausible, but again the problem of the page postback leaves me with the same problem of where the bubble should go. So, when I call create(), is it possible that I can automagically register the UserControl as the destination for the bubble? It seems difficult. 2. Is there some point in the page lifecycle where I can re-wire the event on the UserControl declared eventhandler so that the delegate is called correctly on postback? This seems to be what I am missing. The eventhandler is created on a postback, but is lost because it is not re-created in the UserControl during OnClick. I don't want the UserControl to have to explicitly re-create the thing, but want the child control to re-create it for the UserControl. It sounds like a simple request, but with the UserControl out of the loop, I may be asking for the impossible.","['MyControl.Create(args, new EventHandler(OnClick));\n', 'protected void OnClick(object o, EventArgs args) {}', 'create()', 'MyControl.Create()', 'OnBubble', 'MyControl.Create()', 'Create()', 'MyControl.Create()', 'onload', ""MyControl : CompositeControl \n{\n     public event EventHandler Click;\n\n     //I have a create method\n     void Create(args, EventHandler click)\n     {\n          this.Click = click;\n          //other processing\n     }\n\n     //then the button is wired up.

If I understand correctly, variables defined in a method are stored on the stack and are not affected by garbage collection. So, in this example: the return value of DoIt() will be 8. Since the location of t is on the stack, then that memory cannot be garbage collected or compacted and the reference variable in Increment() will always point to the proper contents of t. However, suppose we have: Now, t is stored on the heap as it is a value of a specific instance of my class. Isn't this possibly a problem if I pass this value as a reference parameter? If I pass t as a reference parameter, p will point to the current location of t. However, if the garbage collector moves this object during a compact, won't that mess up the reference to t in Increment()? Or does the garbage collector update even references created by passing reference parameters? Do I have to worry about this at all? The only mention of worrying about memory being compacted on MSDN (that I can find) is in relation to passing managed references to unmanaged code. Hopefully that's because I don't have to worry about any managed references in managed code. :)","['public class Test\n{\n public Test()\n {\n }\n\n public int DoIt()\n {\n  int t = 7;\n  Increment(ref t);\n  return t;\n }\n\n private int Increment(ref int p)\n {\n  p++;\n }\n}\n', 'public class Test\n{\n private int t = 7;\n\n public Test()\n {\n }\n\n public int DoIt()\n {\n  Increment(ref t);\n  return t;\n }\n\n private int Increment(ref int p)\n {\n  p++;\n }\n}\n']",False

4627510,Moving app between appstore accounts,I have published an app that have sold pretty OK and i have since then started a company where i will do my development.

In reading through an article by Henri Darmon, I came across a statement asserting that the map $\mathcal{H}\to E(\mathbb{C})$ induced by $\Phi_N$ is transcendental as it is of infinite degree. Since $X_0(N) = \mathcal{H}^*/\Gamma_0(N)$, do we extend $\Phi_N$ to $\mathcal{H}$ by tessellating the plane with the fundamental domain of $\Gamma_0(N)$? If so, is the map then seen to be infinite dimensional by the fact that each point in the image has infinitely many fibers (one for each ""copy"" of $\Gamma_0(N)$)?",[],False

But it does not: the word 'owned' is missing, which would suggest that the verbose_name from the NamedModel.Meta is used when the model is set up, not OwnedModel.Meta. This isn't quite what I expect from an inheritance point of view: is there some way to get the field to be created whereby Meta.verbose_name refers to the value on the non-abstract model class, not the abstract one on which the field was defined?

4662447,Onload can fire early when using jsp dynamic includes?,When a jsp page includes jsp dynamic includes... ...is it possible that the document onload event (or prototype's dom:loaded event) could get fired too early? (i.e. before the included filename.jsp has fully loaded) The reason I suspect this may be the case is that the included file is compiled separately and only included by directive at runtime. The parent jsp might assume that loading of the directive itself is sufficient to consider the DOM is loaded - the includes page is loaded asynchronously and its loading is might not be monitored by the document. Is this a valid concern? Thanks in advance,['&lt;jsp:include page=\xe2\x80\x9dfilename.jsp\xe2\x80\x9d /&gt; \n'],False

4684841,Data binding across several windows with WPF / Entity Framework? Pass context around or not?,"Most WPF/EF tutorials only cover databinding in one window. However, in reality data gets displayed across many windows. You often display a record in the first window and dig deeper in related details in the next windows. So, this also is the case in my scenario. Here you can see my data structure and the ui. Actually I am not dealing with Customers and Invoices, but the structure is the same. (My concrete questions are at the very end.) In the InvoicesWindow I can select an Invoice and press ""Show Invoice"". That opens a CustomerWindow displaying Customer details and his invoices. The right invoice is pre-selected. To each Invoice displayed in the CustomerWindow I can add Items or edit them. This is done in a seperated window called ""ItemWindow"". Editing the DataGrids is not an option. They are set to ReadOnly. Here is the code of the wpf-window classes (I only have done displaying data yet, not saving): Invoices Window: Customer Window: Item window: I wrote the code out of my mind. So, maybe some casts are missing and some methods are mis-spelled. I hope I got the right type with ""ObjectSet"", it also could be ""ObjectCollection"" or something like that. The XAML was created widely with assistance of VS2010 like in this video: http://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/data/ff806174.aspx So, finally my questions ;) Is the design of binding I applied correct? In CustomerWindow I create a new context. Between CustomerWindow and ItemWindow I just pass the data of the same context and select the current item manually. In CustomerWindow I use a ObjectSet (or ObjectCollection, I'm not sure about the type anymore) with a single entry as Source for the customersCollectionViewSource. This works fine. However, there is no need for a collection, because I only edit a single Customer. I did not manage to set a single Customer as Source. I didn't know how to adjust the view source which was generated by VS2010. I haven't done saving yet. But I think I am going to run into problems due to my design between CustomerWindow and ItemWindow. Maybe you can give me some advice here. When the ""Apply""-Button in ItemWindow gets pressed, the Item data should be updated in DB. But not the Customer- and Invoices-related data in the CustomerWindow underneath. The DataGrid of Items in CustomerWindow should get updated, when closing the ItemWindow. But not the rest of the fields in the CustomerWindow, since here could have been data changed before opening the ItemWindow. The only solution for me to overcome that ""synchronisation problem"": The User is forced to press ""Apply"" in the CustomerWindow before he can press the ""New Item"" or ""Edit Item"", if there have been any changes.

In this case the asymptotic behavior should be $|a(n)|=O(n^3)$, and finding the corresponding polynomials from the initial values should allow a lower bound as well as coefficients. In this case the sequence is a quasipolynomial, so there's no interference between the values. But can there be? Are there sequences with nontrivial† characteristic polynomial, e.g., $(x-2)^4(x+2)^4(x-1)^3$ that, because of cancellation, yields a sequence that is actually $O(n^2)$? † That is, leading coefficient not zero -- the characteristic equation is of the lowest degree for the particular starting values, or equivalently the g.f. is written with gcd(numerator, denominator) = 1.

4770827,Hahn-Banach. Extend the functional by continuity,"Let $E$ be a dense linear subspace of a normed vector space $X$, and let $Y$ be a Banach space. Suppose $T_{0}\in\mathcal{L}(E,Y)$ is a bounded linear operator from $E$ to $Y$. Show that $T_{0}$ can be extended to $T\in\mathcal{L}(X,Y)$ (by continuity) without increasing its norm. I have a dumb question: Given the Hahn-Banach theorem, what's to prove here? It seems to be the immediate consequence of that theorem. If I am wrong, please show me how to prove this. Thank you!",[],False
4771976,Incorrect Javascript Functions?,"I am completely brand new to Javascript. In fact, I'm just an Objective-C programmer looking to implement just a little Javascript into one of my apps.

4776990,AJAXing a php form using classes,"Please bear with me, my question is quite a specific one. I'm currently building a profile edit page, which contains two forms. I have the forms currently set up to return some javascript code which, when the post has been successful, hides the contents of the holding div of the form, and replaces it with a success message. At the moment there is no AJAX involved, as I wanted to have a working form before AJAXing [sic] it. I've followed multiple online AJAX form tutorials, loads of stackoverflow answers and cannot get a single method to work with my particular code. I'm completely new to AJAX, but fairly proficient in javascript/jQuery and php themselves. So if can anyone would be able to help me convert this to AJAX I would be eternally grateful! I've posted the (working, but completely non-AJAX) code for the first form below. The second is very similiar so once I get this one working transferring it across should (hopefully) be fairly straight forward. So, any takers?

So now my questions are Is it possible to get Friends checkin information (facebook help seems to say yes)? What settings are there to allow a friend to see my checkin information or vice versa? Are there examples which do the same? Edit: A follow up question: If the above is not possible, one alternate I was thinking was to get a list of friends and then for each friend get their checkin information. Would this work? If yes then how, because a simple re query with //checkins did not work (obviously it will not, because the friend has not logged in and allowed my app to get that information).

4799728,How are addition and multiplication duals of each other?,"I don't understand why, in mathematical discourse, addition and multiplication are so often regarded as duals of each other, considering that, for example, $\forall x, y, z\in \mathbb{Z}$ (say), $$ x \times (y + z) = (x\times y) + (x \times z) $$ but $$x + (y \times z) \neq (x + y) \times (x + z).$$ Any clarification would be much appreciated! Edit: I'm shocked by the comments. We must live on different planets. Mentions of the multiplication/addition duality are so frequent and ubiquitous in my experience with mathematical texts, that I don't bother keeping a record of them, so it will be impossible for me to document my post's claims to anyone's satisfaction. Of course, I have no doubt that (once I've recovered from the shock) I'll find examples of said practice, but no reasonable number of examples could do justice to its pervasiveness. Edit 2: OK, here's a quick and easy one: I have often seen some variant of the word ""sum"" (e.g. ""direct sum"", ""disjoint sum"") used as an alternative name for the categorical coproduct. This word choice obviously implies a multiplication/addition duality. I'll think of some more... Edit 3: Recently, in a math paper, I came across a pair of perfectly dual definitions, where the names for the two terms being defined were of the form ""multiplicative &lt;X&gt;"" and ""additive &lt;X&gt;"". Also, it is highly significant that the author of these definitions does not bother to justify this highly suggestive choice of names. This tells me that the author felt that the duality of multiplication and addition would be obvious to his intended audience. Edit 4: The most recent instance that I came across of this pervasive notion was, one or two days ago, in one of TheCatsters' videos. In this video, Cheng says something like ""...the dual [of the product], which is, of course, the sum."" Finding the exact chapter-and-verse will take some time, since I've watched many of those videos recently, and I can't think of any way to find the exact reference other than watching them all over again.",[],False

4806225,Third party DLL throws exception: Error HRESULT E_FAIL has been returned from a call to a COM component,"Not sure if it is acceptable to come back to this as I wrote the question some time ago but recently found I needed to go back to this method and have to find a solution. I have edited this post to include new information at the bottom, after the original posting. Original post: I am still fairly new to Windows programming so some of it is rather weird and very mysterious to me. This might be obvious or it might not be. I know this error is exceedingly common but I have not found a solution yet. I am using C# and Visual Studio 2008. I am trying to use a third party dll that is supplied with an application I am using. I cannot add it as a reference in my C# project that makes use of it and was told I needed to create an interop as it is a COM library. The DLL in question is Peak_Finder4.dll and I created this using: I was able to add this as a reference and I can see the objects I want to make use of in the Object Browser. The code in question is The exception is caught when attempting to use the FindPeaks method. The error log reads: Does anyone have any idea what the problem might be? EDIT: I thought about using DllImport and I did a dumpbin of the dll and rather than seeing the methods I expected I saw Dump of file Peak_Finder4.dll File Type: DLL Section contains the following exports for Peak_Finder4.DLL Summary New information: The exception I get from FindPeaks is the same as mentioned in the original post, though I am not using a dll written C# now, but in c++/cli. I should also mention that I used this FindPeaks method in an unmanaged ATL C++ project and it worked fine. This makes me wonder if the problem is with one of the objects I pass to the function, such as the strings that need to be set. When I look at the type library for this class it lists the types it accepts as: However, when I look at the types it accepts in the object viewer it uses .NET types On top of this the PeakFinder4 object is created using a factory method in another class and I do it like this: CreatePeakFinder is defined as: and in object viewer I see it as: SciexPeakDataType and SciexDataType are simply defined in an enumeration in the dlls that define these methods.

For instance if I use ONLY message security, with certificate-based negotiation, I don't think message contents are actually encrypted (ie. a packet sniffer could intercept the raw message contents -- even if the service enforces authentication)?

4925770,Using Polynomial-Time Reduction to Prove Hardness,"From what I understand of polynomial-time reduction, there are two instances of it: many-one and Turing. Many-one simply breaks down problem A into many instances of problem B, and uses the (known) computational difficulty of B to evaluate A. They remind me almost of a divide-and-conquer approach... take a hard problem and keep breaking it down until you have workable units, then, decide whether the amount of those small units used to solve the big problem approaches infinity or not. I'm not entirely sure that I fully understand Turing reduction, but here goes: Turing reductions reduce (break down?) problem A into problem B: that is to say, an algorithm that could solve problem A has a subroutine that solves problem B. In this way, an algorithm could be developed that solves A in which the call to problem B is replaced with the algorithm that solves problem B. This holds if A is B-recursive, B-computable, B-recursively enumerable, and B-computably enumerable. (If I said anything silly or wrong, please let me know!) Now, the problem I'm running into is how to apply these time-reductions to proving the hardness of a problem. The way I'm looking at it, for both cases, if A is reducible to B, then A is hard if B is hard. But if B is easy,how does one judge A? For the Many-One reduction, I think that A can be called hard if A) the number of reductions it needs to make before a suitably solvable unit is reached approaches infinity, or B) the number of B's that A reduces to approaches infinity. For a Turing reduction, I'm really having trouble drawing a logical line between the reduction and proof of hardness. Does anyone have any insight on this idea? Thank you very much!",[],False

5045926,How do I resolve <xsl:import> and <xsl:include> elements with relative paths when using xsltc.exe XslCompiledTransforms?,"As part of our web application's build process, I have set up our XSLT stylesheets to be built with Microsoft's xsltc.exe compiler whenever we run a full compile. During local development this has worked great, as the code is compiled and hosted in the same location. However, once this was put on the build server, problems arose. The build server will compile the XSLT stylesheets just like I do locally, but then a script runs that deploys the compiled code to our internal staging web server. Once these binaries have moved from where they were compiled, the relative paths in and elements no longer resolve correctly, causing exceptions that look like this when the XSLT stylesheets are ran. Could not find a part of the path 'e:\{PATH}\xslt\docbook\VERSION'. at System.IO.__Error.WinIOError(Int32 errorCode, String maybeFullPath) at System.IO.FileStream.Init(String path, FileMode mode, FileAccess access, Int32 rights, Boolean useRights, FileShare share, Int32 bufferSize, FileOptions options, SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES secAttrs, String msgPath, Boolean bFromProxy, Boolean useLongPath) at System.IO.FileStream..ctor(String path, FileMode mode, FileAccess access, FileShare share, Int32 bufferSize, FileOptions options, String msgPath, Boolean bFromProxy) at System.IO.FileStream..ctor(String path, FileMode mode, FileAccess access, FileShare share, Int32 bufferSize) at System.Xml.XmlUrlResolver.GetEntity(Uri absoluteUri, String role, Type ofObjectToReturn) at System.Xml.Xsl.Runtime.XmlQueryContext.GetDataSource(String uriRelative, String uriBase) Here's a general idea of the code as it stands now: var xslt = new XslCompiledTransform(); xslt.Load(typeof(Namespace.XslTransforms.CompiledXsltStylesheet)); xslt.Transform(""input.xml"", ""output.xml""); Right now I'm using the XslCompiledTransform.Load() method with a single 'Type' parameter to bring in the xsltc.exe-based pre-compiled XSLT stylesheets. I can tell from the stack trace that the .NET framework is using the XmlUrlResolver to try to resolve the actual location of these external stylesheets, but I don't see a way to provide an overridden implementation of XmlResolver where I could pass in a new baseUri that points to where these stylesheets live on the web server. I assume I can resolve this by no longer pre-compiling with xsltc.exe and loading the XSLT stylesheets via XmlReaders, since that will let me use the other XslCompiledTransform.Load() methods which have a parameter where I could provide my own XmlResolver implementation. However, I like the pre-compilation option for syntax validation and performance, so I don't want to give it up unless I absolutely have to. Is there a way to use xsltc.exe to pre-compile these XSLT stylesheets, yet still provide a way to explicitly state the baseUri for relative path resolution of and elements at runtime?","['&lt;xsl:import&gt;', '&lt;xsl:include&gt;', '&lt;xsl:include&gt;', '&lt;xsl:import&gt;']",False

5053122,Should Presence Be Broadcast to an XMPP Server When Attaching (not connecting) via Strophe?,"The XMPP spec states that the client should broadcast presence upon connecting to an XMPP server. Strophe has two methods to ""connect"" to an XMPP server: connect and attach. Connect does a full authorization and attach is for reconnecting to a pre-existing connection. When using attach, should the client broadcast presence to the server? In my testing, it appears that if I do not broadcast presence on attach, the client does not receive messages (presence, message, or otherwise) from other users, and if the client attempts to send any stanzas, he is immediately disconnected by the server. It's as if the server has no idea the user is connected without the presence broadcast. This seems as if I answered my own question, however, I'm wondering if there is perhaps a bug in the server or if I'm doing something wrong or is this expected behavior?",[],False

I am extremely averse to storing people's credit card information and I refuse to take risks in that area. I am stuck between a rock and a hard place, however. Using a gateway in my local area and currency is prohibitively expensive. Basically, as things stand, we can't do business through a gateway. Yet we need recurrent billing and the need to store credit card information has arisen. I thought of storing the credit card numbers (encrypted), partially or wholly, then saving the CCV number locally on an unwired machine. To bill customers, I would generate temp billing tables, and fire off a form manually for each customer that needs to be billed. I would manually populate the CCV and pipe a form to my payment processor (they will not store the data, unfortunately--only process the payment). It's a manual PITA, and defeats the point of automation, but it's my best bet outside of storing the data outright. Can you give me any advice on my scheme?",[],False

Now, if re-displays the original layout with the ListView (I store its instance for re-displaying it, it is not being re-created!), the highlighted row is NOT highlighted anymore. According to google this is OK, and the highlight will come back as soon as I'll use the trackball. The real problem is that even if I use the trackball to move up or down in the list now, no other row in the ListView becomes highlighted. Instead, in each row which should be highlighted as a result of the scrolling, the TextView becomes selected and I know that since I set the TextView to be ticking (TruncateAt.MARQUEE). ONLY if I CLICK the trackball, then the highlight comes back to the row which its TextView is ticking at the moment.

In the Timer's ElapsedEvent listener I look for any files in the Download directory that are older than the Timer interval (for testing = 1 min., for deployment ~20 min.) and delete them.

The app works perfect when I publish to IIS from a physical directory not in wwwroot. Obviously, it seems IIS places some sort of lock on files in the web root. I have tested impersonating an admin user to run the app and it still does not work. Any tips on how to circumvent the lock programmatically when in wwwroot?

But after coming to end, I realized one thing that my app text size is common in all tablet sizes. So I will re frame my question. Problem: I used my own custom text size in entire app. and some what satisfied with 7 inch tablet. But when I am looking the same thing in 8.9 inches and 10.1 inch tablet its containing lots of white spaces and text size are also relatively small. So is there some way that I can change the text size according to my tablet size??? It may look novice question but I am struggling with this because the same app which look wonderful in 7 inches, is loosing its essence in 8.9 and 10.1 inches. Or there is something else which I could do with my app for the same. Probable Solution:- As my topic indicates is there some way to change the text size as tablet size changes. Either dynamically or any other way. EDITED:: As per Cheeta answer, approach is correct but I can't do it for each layout buttons and textfields and other field. There are hundreds of field like this in single app. Can I do it in some one place and call it required attribute. Is custom tag is approach which I am looking for.Is it possible???? Any help will be appreciated. Thanks in advance. NOTE I have not reached to a answer but cheetah answer is somewhat leading to correct way.

Every week I will be getting a Delta files which will only contain changes to the data. Problem : Given a list of items i need to figure out whether each item(which will be the 10 digit number) is present in the dataset. The approach I have planned : Will parse the dataset and put it a DB(To be done at the start of the week) like MySQL or Postgres. The reason i want to have RDBMS in the first step is I want to have full time series data. Then generate some kind of Key Value store out of this database with the latest valid data which supports operation to find out whether each item is present in the dataset or not(Thinking some kind of a NOSQL db, like Redis here optimised for search. Should have persistence and be distributed). This datastructure will be read-only. Query this key value store to find out whether each item is present (if possible match a list of values all at once instead of matching one item at a time). Want this to be blazing fast. Will be using this functionality as the back-end to a REST API Sidenote: Language of my preference is Python.",[],False

5152288,"How to make a Type known in one AppDomain, but unknown in another?","My question is simple. For unit test purposes, I need a statically compiled type deriving from the Exception type, which is known in one AppDomain, but unknown in another. A straightforward solution would be: To create a subfolder under the directory of the application executable. Place there an assembly with some Exception derived type. Update the app.config file, adding this folder to the probing path. Create a new AppDomain, but with a slightly different app.config - without the element. Now, the main AppDomain can load the type easily, because its location is in the probing path, but the second AppDomain cannot - mission accomplished. But this method requires: An additional folder A dummy assembly A dummy app config file I am wondering if I can achieve my goal simpler, but without Reflection.Emit. Thanks. EDIT: Any Exception derived type will do. Motivation: We have a distributed application, consisting of clients, the server and agents. There are assemblies found exclusively on agents and there are some found exclusively on the server. Both the server and agents can be extended after being deployed with new features. The thing is that it is possible that some action will fail with an exception, which type is unknown on the receiving end. I am developing a facility to cope with this situation and wish to unit test it now. For that I need to simulate a situation where an exception raised on a remote site is of a type unknown on the receiving end.",[],False

As it is, the user has to click the mic to start the recording but I'm working on an installation where the user won't interact with the computer. Thus I have to trigger the recording some other way. As far as it seems you can't access the speech input functionality by code, i.e. you can't call a function to start recording. So now I'm looking at simulating mouse click on the mic. I've tried using javaScript but it seems only events and event handlers are affected (e.g. a simulated click on an input field would fire its click handlers but wouldn't give focus to the field.) So now I'm looking at simulating Windows system mouse clicks, and I've found some programs that can do that (mostly on intervals) and it works, the recording starts. But the problem is that I have to activate the click simulation from the browser application. By best bet so far is AutoHotkey that enables you to create custom scripts, in my case a script that simulates a mouse click at a given position. So, if I could execute this script from the browser I would be safe, but I don't no how to do that. Any ideas and / or thoughts are welcome!",[],False

5169904,developing an ebook reader with an antivirus-like license type,"I am trying to build a site that will have e-books. Users will download books paying money. But in order to prevent piracy, I want a system that will restrict users to use the book for n (n=1 or more )number of pcs .

Thanks in advance EDIT: I compared the system with the antivirus licensing procedure. The book to be downloaded might be necessary to be in an especial format ( .exe or something else?) which I am not aware of. Suppose a user downloads a book in hard disk. Then the user has to get connected with the internet to for once to be able to start reading the book (just like antivirus activation). If the user copies the book in the hard disk of some other pc, then the user would not be able to read that. Online activation would be necessary again from that pc.

My goal is simple, log every incoming request against a set of parameters and for reporting count or sum the data from the log. In this I have come up with 2 options and I'd like to know what more experienced people think is the better option. Option 1: Use Boolean Values and Count the ""True"" rows Because each row is written once and never updated, store each count parameter as a bool and in the summation thread, pull the rows in a query and perform a count against each set of true values to get the totals for each parameter. This would save space if there are a lot of parameters because I imagine Azure Tables store bool as a single bit value. Option 2: Use Int Values and Sum the rows Each row is written as above, but instead each parameter column is added as a value of 0 or 1. Summation would occur by querying all of the rows and using a Sum operation for each column. This would be quicker because Summation could happen in a single query, but am I losing something in storing 32 bit integers for a Boolean value? I think at this point for query speed, Option 2 is best, but I want to ask out loud to get opinions on the storage and retrieval aspect because I don't know Azure Tables that well (and I'm hoping this helps other people down the road).",[],False

5366292,Drive time polygons with Google Maps API,"I'm looking for a pure (or as-pure-as-possible) Google Maps JavaScript API V3 solution to add drive-time polygon functionality to my Google Maps app. Basically the workflow is that the user clicks a Marker or point on the map, and a polygon is generated around the Marker/point indicating the area where you can drive within 5 minutes in any direction. I'm not sure if it is even possible to do this as a pure Google Maps API solution, because it would require too many calls to the Directions Service with random routes and then any that don't fall within the time threshold are thrown away. Not sure if this is feasible or what the best way to engineer this would be. It might be necessary to use some backend processing for this, but I want to rule out out all other options first, but any examples of backend solutions are welcome. Any help, suggestions, or examples are greatly appreciated. The following are some examples I have come across, but they either aren't a pure Google Maps API solution and/or aren't using drive-times: Google Maps Utility Library example - draws 1, 2, and 3 minutes drive-time polygons around the point you click on, but it uses Esri's sample Geoprocessing services to run the calculations and generate the polygon geometry, so that's not going to work for my requirements. 30 mile directions - it's a pure Google Maps API solution using the Directions API and draws a nice polygon, but it doesn't take drive-times into the calculation, just distance from the point to 30 miles out. Mapnificent - seems to be a pure Google Maps API solution, and they have an API, but they are dealing with public transit times pulled from public transit data, not drive times. So the areas that ""open up"" as you increase the time indicate where from the point you can get on public transit within the specified time.

5412378,approach to re-route (plain-text) protocols for machines behind a router that are down,"I've been looking for some time now, how to achieve that, but I can't seem to find similar solutions or synthesize one from my knowledge. Here are the details about my setup: I have one gateway/router that has the uplink to the internet. ""Behind"" that are several different servers. Some of those have a public IP, others don't. Either way, all the services I wanted to expose are exposed by either unblocking the respective port on the target IP or DNATing the port through to one of the machines with no public IP. That whole setup works nicely (for the bigger part it's a netfilter-based ruleset in combination with a few routing table entries). Now the problem: sometimes machines behind the router can be down (I can't afford extra redundancy at the moment). If that happens, I would like the user of a service - in particular HTTP - to have a ""better"" user experience than a network timeout and offer a ""backup"" server that would only display a short notice about the fact that the service behind the router is down at the moment. So if the router can't reach the service, it should re-route the traffic dynamically to the ""backup"". Does anyone know of a solution to this problem or can suggest a way how to approach it? Suggestions for search terms are also welcome ...",[],False

5420170,(poor man's )product recommendation implementation,"I am trying to build a poor man's recommendation system for a online store. I want to realize that kind of Amazon ""Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought"" feature and I read a lot about it. I know there is that Apache Mahout thing, but I am unable to tweak the server that way. Then there would be the google prediction API, but it cost money so I start experimenting myself. I got an orderhistory with 250.000+ items and I wrote a nested MySQL Query to find orders which contain the current article, rank the other order items and sort that table for ranking, so I got a set of products which other people ordered along with the current article. The problem is, the query could take up to 10sec - so this can't be used directly. I thought about a caching table, but this query stops after 20 minutes (there are 60.000 products and 250.000 ordered items) So I am unable to fill that table. My current workaround is the following: The recommendation HTML is loaded via AJAX ondocumentready, so the site loads, while the recommendation loads in the background. The recommendation data is processed once and stored in a filecache (PEAR simple cache) so it loads faster the next time. So the cache is made on demand if someone visits the site and stored for a day or maybe a week. I ask myself and you, would that be an acceptable approach or is it stupid and unperformant? Would it be better to store the cached data in a db or in file (I think about performance and parallel hits). I mean, in the worst case I would endup with 60.000 cachefiles. I would prefer a pre-computed table with all the data, but as I said it takes to long and I don't know how to optimize it. (Waiting till the SQL Dude come back from holidays ^^) Thanks for any hint, opinion. btw. this is the query: EDIT: I thought about the given answers and I think they are similar to my initial idea. The above code result in the following table: The ParentID is the current item, ChildID the items that ordered in the past along with ParentID, Rank is the precomputed count of how often the child is ordered with current item.

Assuming that I needed to just return the first validation error, I added a method to our validation runner to achieve that goal (UPDATE: see edit at the bottom for the exact method): I also set up a simple test method to verify in NUnit: The problem is that this test's output is highly unpredictable.

Unfortunately, CGFX doesn't seem to support double precision, and even then double precision is limited for my intentions. Because CGFX, because of it's intended design, does not have a bignum class, I thought it would be best to create my own. I managed to create a prototype in C++ -- which only uses unsigned integers -- but when I tried to move it to CGFX, FX Composer 2.5 couldn't seem to compile it.

I have a tab-delimited txt file which is sorted by the first column (sample dataset below). Duplicate entries exist within this column. Ultimately, I would like to use a hash to point to all values of which have the same key (first column value). Should a new key come along, the contents of the hash are to be serialized, saved, etc, and then cleared for the new key to populate it. As a result, my goal is to have only 1 key present. Therefore, if I have N unique keys, I wish to make N hashes each pointing to their respective entry.

5817735,Trying to build algorithm for optimal tower placement in a game,"This is going to be a long post and just for fun, so if you don't have much time better go help folks with more important questions instead :) There is a game called ""Tower Bloxx"" recently released on xbox. One part of the game is to place different colored towers on a field in a most optimal way in order to maximize number of most valuable towers. I wrote an algorithm that would determine the most efficient tower placement but it is not very efficient and pretty much just brute forcing all possible combinations. For 4x4 field with 4 tower types it solves it in about 1 hr, 5 tower types would take about 40 hours which is too much. Here are the rules: There are 5 types of towers that could be placed on a field. There are several types of fields, the easiest one is just 4x4 matrix, others fields have some ""blanks"" where you can't build. Your aim is to put as many the most valuable towers on a field as possible to maximize total tower value on a field (lets assume that all towers are built at once, there is no turns). Tower types (in order from less to most valuable): Blue - can be placed anywhere, value = 10 Red - can be placed only besides blue, value = 20 Green - placed besides red and blue, value = 30 Yellow - besides green, red and blue, value = 40 White - besides yellow, green, red and blue, value = 100 Which means that for example green tower should have at least 1 red and 1 blue towers at either north, south, west or east neighbor cells (diagonals don't count). White tower should be surrounded with all other colors. Here is my algorithm for 4 towers on 4x4 field: Total number of combinations = 4^16 Loop through [1..4^16] and convert every number to base4 string in order to encode tower placement, so 4^16 = ""3333 3333 3333 3333"" which would represent our tower types (0=blue,...,3=yellow) Convert tower placement string into matrix. For every tower in a matrix check its neighbors and if any of requirements fails this whole combination fails. Put all correct combinations into an array and then sort this array as strings in lexicographic order to find best possible combination (first need to sort characters in a string). The only optimization I came up with is to skip combinations that don't contain any most valuable towers. It skips some processing but I still loop through all 4^16 combinations. Any thought how this can be improved? Code samples would be helpful if in java or php. -------Update-------- After adding more illegal states (yellow cannot be built in the corners, white cannot be built in corners and on the edges, field should contain at least one tower of each type), realizing that only 1 white tower could be possibly built on 4x4 field and optimizing java code the total time was brought down from 40 to ~16 hours. Maybe threading would bring it down to 10 hrs but that's probably brute forcing limit.",[],False

5939351,Is client-side OLAP (e.g. client-side MDX construction plus xmla4js) bad for security?,"I'm working on a public-facing web project that will be powered in part by an OLAP server. I wanted to compare a couple ways of doing this from a security perspective: My initial idea was to pass some representation of the user's intent to the web server via AJAX, have the web server do lots of input validation and construct an appropriate MDX expression to pass to the OLAP server, and finally proxy the OLAP results back to the browser. (Tangentially, this seems to be the approach taken by jpivot; e.g. I just clicked to drill down into a table in a jpivot example, and what got sent to the server wasn't MDX but simply the x-www-form-urlencoded string ""wcf65768426.x=3&amp;wcf65768426.y=3"".) In contrast, the xmla4js project seems premised on opening up a firewall port and exposing your OLAP server to the world (or at least to your particular customers) via XML/A, writing MDX queries in client-side javascript, and having the browser directly hit the OLAP server. My gut reaction is to be quite suspicious of the second approach. It seems to presume that nothing bad can happen if someone were to execute arbitrary MDX statements against my OLAP server. I'm not yet a student of particularly advanced MDX, but it's not immediately obvious to me that this is a risk-free proposition. At very least someone could kick off some very expensive queries, or download a larger chunk of your dataset than you were hoping to easily make available to people. This isn't the sort of thing people generally do with SQL servers, and I'm initially inclined to think the same reasons suggest you shouldn't do it with OLAP servers either. But I'd also like to assume that the folks behind xmla4js had some use cases in mind that were not crazy security risks. And I guess potentially I could be thinking about this too cautiously. Any more experienced OLAP folks want to comment on the wisdom of letting people directly bang on your OLAP server, e.g. via XML/A?",[],False

The problem here is that I have to mention all possible subtypes in the element which could be a lot in a real application. A minor issue is that, although the attribute has the correct type it has an ugly name . Because of the redundant schema definition, not an option! 2.) modeling Catalogue to contain a of the parent class This does only work if the XML documents are formulated like . Thus, not an option! 3.)

6019955,Does rollBack improve performance?,"I have just successfully attempted using beginTransaction() to execute my sql statements in my project using PHP. I have an array of items need to be written to the database, and each item must be validated against something before getting stored. One of the good things about turning off the auto-commit behaviour of a database is you can rollback the whole transaction if something goes wrong in the middle. In my project, if one item is invalid, the whole array should not be recorded in the database, which is why I chose to use this approach. Now I am just wondering if this really is a better way in terms of performance? Because even if the last item in the array is validated, I still need to manually commit() the previous execution. Does commit repeat the sql execution? The only advantage I can think of right now is you only need to do one loop instead of two if you want to validate them all (assuming all items are valid) and then write each of them.",[],True

6026328,How to become a C++ library developer?,"I would like to ask what field should I dig into to become a C++ library developer. I started to teach myself C++ 5 years ago, and I'm deeply interested in it. At work I use C# and Ruby, at school I use mostly Java and very little C++; however, C++ is always my favorite language. I bought many C++ books and read it over and over, these books are: Effective C++ Effective STL Accelerate C++ C++ Template The C++ Programming Language ... etc Although I enjoy reading the C++ Template book, the material is too dry and I feel it's very difficult to apply. Sometimes I want to apply it to my project but it turned out to be unnecessary, worse become complex and it's hard to maintain. Besides I found it so difficult to implement such a library like STL. The simplest one that I can partially understand is or . Other libraries is just like a bunch of messes. From the day I joined this website, I realize that there are many C++ experts here. So could you guys share me some experiences how to learn and understand the core C++, as well as developing a skill to write C++ libraries?

So my question is this: how does PowerBuilder know that ""2010-10-22"" is a date and what are the rules for including date literals like this one without specific conversion? Is it based upon the fact that the left-hand value is clearly a date datatype or is it based upon the particular date format used in ""2010-10-22"" or both?

6033912,Entry level hardware for SBS 2008 Standard,"Has anyone experience of running SBS 2008 Standard (so no SQL) on low spec hardware? In particular I'm concerned about the disk system, since CPU and memory are cheap these days. We have a number of customers running SBS 2003 on Poweredge 840s with a SAS5/i RAID controller (no battery so write-thru not write-back) and two 146GB disks as a RAID1. For a 5 user network this is more than adequate, but SBS 2008 seems considerably more demanding and the SAS5/i is a fairly basic controller. However using a Perc5/i and a three or four disk RAID5 adds a lot to the cost and our small customers are likely to baulk at the cost. Has anyone used SBS 2008 on hardware like this? Is the SAS5/i and 146GB of disk space adequate? Thanks, John Rennie",[],False
