Orders have many Deliveries, and Orders and Deliveries have a status (int) field. EmailTemplates have a status they apply to and a bool IsForDeliveries field. EmailTemplate on order.status == emailTemplate.status, but I want to add a condition on the association such that emailTemplate.IsForDeliveries == false.

165035,Custom Wordpress index.php which circumvents The Loop isn't working correctly,"I'm building a Wordpress theme for a client and it's unlike any other theme I've built before in that the homepage is a collection of posts spread across multiple different containers and styles. It's supposed to look and feel like a magazine in that, at the beginning of each month, 9 different posts are published simultaneously that each belong to a different category. And many of the posts are styled differently, I'm unable to use the traditional Loop: First, I'll explain how I'm trying to solve the problem, then describe the issues I'm having. At the top of index.php, I have the following PHP code: The array is a collection of each of the category slugs that I'll need to query with - each of these will have one post to be displayed. The idea is that I can loop over this array and, using an otherwise-fixed set of query parameters (), retrieve the single most recent post for each of these slugs. As I'm looping over the slug array, I'm storing the query result in an associative array () where the category slug ""points to"" the actual post. Later on in the body of the page, I'm grabbing the required post from using the category slug index. Here's an example: The reason I'm using a foreach loop at the beginning is because, as I understand it, several of the core Wordpress template tags (, , etc.) are only available within The Loop. Because I'm calling manually here (which is called behind the scenes during The Loop), I'm also using the foreach to limit the scope of whatever weirdo voodoo happens when I call . For the most part, this works. In the above example, the results of calling appear as expected. However, some other template tags aren't returning any values ( and , specifically). I'm not getting any errors and the page loads fine when I try this out in a real live Wordpress install. I'm assuming the problem lies in my lack of understanding of how to properly bypass The Loop in this situation, but the fact that there aren't any errors or any other clue as to the problem has brought me here. This is Wordpress 3.0 running on some flavor of Linux. I've got many other Wordpress installs running on this box without issue and I'm able to use this same Wordpress instance with the default theme without a problem.

The html is not reflecting changes I've made with javascript. I have a small snippet of my code here: http://jsfiddle.net/7993K/8/ The slightly longer version of why I am going about it like this: This is a large form that a site inspector checked out. It is brought into an online software app, and the lady in charge of communication with clients will review this information, speak back with the inspector on the phone. This form is saved in a database as html. After the woman is done reviewing the form, there may be a box or two that wasn't checked, that she would like to check, before emailing to the client ( there were issues, needed to be fixed, now that they are fixed, she can send out the proper report that everything was checked off) She checks the boxes off, but they don't update the HTML, they only change the value, which will show, but won't show up when I get the innerHTML of parentElement. You will see in my JSFIDDLE http://jsfiddle.net/7993K/8/: Click check it out upon loading: checked = checked uncheck box: checked = checked change to false: alert confirms the checked property is false, but check it out shows the innerHTML as checked. I will need to access this innerHTML with the proper information loaded (as in, if it is checkmarked, the html should reflect that) PRE-EDIT: I think I can do this by making an event onclick of the label. That event takes the (""parentElement"").innerHTML and split it in a few different places and put it back together with the right checked value. Will be slightly different if the input isn't checked to begin with.

448525,C# Asynchronous Options for Processing a List,"I am trying to better understand the Async and the Parallel options I have in C#. In the snippets below, I have included the 5 approaches I come across most. But I am not sure which to choose - or better yet, what criteria to consider when choosing: Method 1: Task (see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd321439.aspx) Calling StartNew is functionally equivalent to creating a Task using one of its constructors and then calling Start to schedule it for execution. However, unless creation and scheduling must be separated, StartNew is the recommended approach for both simplicity and performance. TaskFactory's StartNew method should be the preferred mechanism for creating and scheduling computational tasks, but for scenarios where creation and scheduling must be separated, the constructors may be used, and the task's Start method may then be used to schedule the task for execution at a later time. Method 2: QueueUserWorkItem (see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.threadpool.getmaxthreads.aspx) You can queue as many thread pool requests as system memory allows. If there are more requests than thread pool threads, the additional requests remain queued until thread pool threads become available. You can place data required by the queued method in the instance fields of the class in which the method is defined, or you can use the QueueUserWorkItem(WaitCallback, Object) overload that accepts an object containing the necessary data. Method 3: Parallel.Foreach (see: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.tasks.parallel.foreach.aspx) The Parallel class provides library-based data parallel replacements for common operations such as for loops, for each loops, and execution of a set of statements. The body delegate is invoked once for each element in the source enumerable. It is provided with the current element as a parameter. Method 4: IAsync.BeginInvoke (see: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc190824.aspx) BeginInvoke is asynchronous; therefore, control returns immediately to the calling object after it is called. Method 5: BackgroundWorker (see: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.backgroundworker.aspx) To set up for a background operation, add an event handler for the DoWork event. Call your time-consuming operation in this event handler. To start the operation, call RunWorkerAsync. To receive notifications of progress updates, handle the ProgressChanged event. To receive a notification when the operation is completed, handle the RunWorkerCompleted event. I suppose the obvious critieria would be: Is any better than the other for performance? Is any better than the other for error handling? Is any better than the other for monitoring/feedback? But, how do you choose? Thanks in advance for your insights.","['// using System.Threading.Tasks.Task.Factory\nvoid Do_1()\n{\n    var _List = GetList();\n    _List.ForEach(i =&gt; Task.Factory.StartNew(_ =&gt; { DoSomething(i); }));\n}\n', '// using System.Threading.ThreadPool\nvoid Do_2()\n{\n    var _List = GetList();\n    var _Action = new WaitCallback((o) =&gt; { DoSomething(o); });\n    _List.ForEach(x =&gt; ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(_Action));\n}\n', '// using System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel\nvoid Do_3()\n{\n    var _List = GetList();\n    var _Action = new Action&lt;object&gt;((o) =&gt; { DoSomething(o); });\n    Parallel.ForEach(_List, _Action);\n}\n', '// using IAsync.BeginInvoke()\nvoid Do_4()\n{\n    var _List = GetList();\n    var _Action = new Action&lt;object&gt;((o) =&gt; { DoSomething(o); });\n    _List.ForEach(x =&gt; _Action.BeginInvoke(x, null, null));\n}\n', '// using System.ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker\nvoid Do_5()\n{\n    var _List = GetList();\n    using (BackgroundWorker _Worker = new BackgroundWorker())\n    {\n        _Worker.DoWork += (s, arg) =&gt;\n        {\n            arg.Result = arg.Argument;\n            DoSomething(arg.Argument);\n        };\n        _Worker.RunWorkerCompleted += (s, arg) =&gt;\n        {\n            _List.Remove(arg.Result);\n            if (_List.Any())\n                _Worker.RunWorkerAsync(_List[0]);\n        };\n        if (_List.Any())\n            _Worker.RunWorkerAsync(_List[0]);\n    }\n}\n']",False
457702,Setting sqlite I/O priority from python module (speeding up sqlite commits),"I have a python program in an embedded system that needs to write to an sqlite database. This database is mission critical and thus needs to be fully synchronous. The problem is that the database commits take a LONG time (3-30 seconds) for a single insert.

I've been searching for any way to make the database commit take a shorter amount of time but I'm sort of lost. I've tried setting , and that seemed to help but only a small amount. Now I'm thinking it could be sqlite being starved of i/o time. Is there a way to increase JUST the process priority of sqlite3?

531335,"Explain RestEasy providers, resources and singletons in relation to classes vs instances?","I'm building a JAX-RS app that consists of a stockroom and a workplace. The stockroom holds a set of Java classes that can be instantiated (via AJAX) to create named instances of those classes in the workplace. So far I'm able to reference the stockroom and workplace fine by declaring them as ""singletons"" in the RestEasy application I'm unable to understand how to understand how the stockroom content classes should be handled. The effect I'm trying to achieve is that when I dynamically create an instance of one of the stockroom classes, that instance can be dynamically accessed via REST commands. I've tried various permutations of: I think I'm missing knowledge of how the Java notion of how classes work as factories for making instances, and how both of these relate to what RestEasy calls classes, singletons (singletons ARE classes, yet RestEasy registers them as instances) and resources (instances?). I suspect I'll wind up needing to dynamically register new instances but can't find a way to do that either. I did find a way to do it given the ServletContext, but am not able to get access to that either. Can someone get me on the right track?","['    singletons.add(StockPlace.getInstance());\n    singletons.add(WorkPlace.getInstance());\n', '    classes.add(SomeComponent.class);\n']",False

586395,"Displaying AJAX responses in the same order in which they were sent out, *without* using queueing or synchronous requests?","I'm sending out a bunch of getJSON() requests to a remote server (to fetch images), and I'd like to display the responses (images) in the same order in which I send the requests. Problem is, AJAX is asynchronous, so the responses come in whatever order they want - usually all mixed up. I could queue them or make them synchronous - only sending out one request at a time - but that will severely limit the performance. So is there a way I can identify which response belongs to which request when the responses come back? I was thinking you could put an ""id"" variable into the JSON callback parameter (e.g. callback=response03) and then somehow parse that callback function name when the response arrives (thus grabbing the id, ""03""). But probably not. My code is something like this: I've tried creating a bunch of new divs to hold the returned images, thinking I could populate the divs with their respective images, but that didn't work either. I've searched and although there are similar questions about AJAX on here, none are as specific as what I'm looking for. Thanks.

723864,"SQL 2005: Keys, Indexes and Constraints Questions","I have a series of questions about Keys, Indexes and Constraints in SQL, SQL 2005 in particular. I have been working with SQL for about 4 years but I have never been able to get definitive answers on this topic and there is always contradictory info on blog posts, etc. Most of the time tables I create and use just have an Identity column that is a Primary Key and other tables point to it via a Foreign Key. With join tables I have no Identity and create a composite Primary Key over the Foreign Key columns. The following is a set of statements of my current beliefs, which may be wrong, please correct me if so, and other questions. So here goes: As I understand it the difference between a Clustered and Non Clustered Index (regardless of whether it is Unique or not) is that the Clustered Index affects the physical ordering of data in a table (hence you can only have one in a table), whereas a Non Clustered Index builds a tree data structure. When creating Indexes why should I care about Clustered vs Non Clustered? When should I use one or the other? I was told that inserting and deleting are slow with Non-Clustered indexes as the tree needs to be ""rebuilt."" I take it Clustered indexes do not affect performance this way? I see that Primary Keys are actually just Clustered Indexes that are Unique (do they have to be clustered?). What is special about a Primary Key vs a Clustered Unique Index? I have also seen Constraints, but I have never used them or really looked at them. I was told that the purpose of Constraints is that they are for enforcing data integrity, whereas Indexes are aimed at performance. I have also read that constraints are acually implemented as Indexes anyway so they are ""the same."" This doesnt sound right to me. How are constraints different to Indexes?",[],True
736938,Implementing w3schools ajax example in application,I am having difficulty implementing an ajax example from the W3C website. The example pulls back results from a database and displays them in a table based on which option has been selected from a Dropdown menu. http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_ajax_database.asp I have tried configuring this example to meet my requirements. This is to update a field in the database based on the option that is selected. I think i'm close I just wanted to make sure I am on the right track. When an option is selected an ajax call is made which triggers my php script to make the changes. It looks like this: however this data is not entered into the database. I can retrieve the value of $q which is either 'approved' 'pending' or 'disapproved' but not the specific order number to update that individual row. My select box looks like this: this is wrapped in form which also sends an email based on which checkbox is selected. This functionality works and I can send an email to an individual row: do I need to implement the update code in the same php script? or use the same approach to loop through an array?

907090,GWT Date Formatting,"I have a customized GWT Date -Time widget which is a combination of two text boxes, one to hold the date and one to hold time. When I enter the date 04/09/1956 12:00 AM (in the Date widget), internally in the ValueChangeHandler for my widget I run it through the GWT's DateTimeFormat class' format() method which takes in the date and time zone information and gives me a formatted Date String that is User friendly when displayed and then based on the date in that widget, I set the time in the Time part of it. The issue is when I put in dates not too old (my observation was dates not older than those in the year 1981), there seems to be no problem at all. When I put in dates older than that say 1956 in my case, there is some weird Daylight savings logic that messes my format of my string by adjusting it back by 1 hour and gives me 04/08/1956 11:00 PM instead of 04/09/1956 12:00 AM. Even though the date object still represents the date I intended to, the formatted string is messed up with a different date representation. This is issue is reproducible only when I run the app in production mode. When I run it locally on my machine in the hosted mode, I do not see this problem at all. That is the worst part. I understand that GWT reads from a javascript file called noCache.js when we run in production mode as opposed to the Web-INF/lib folder in hosted mode. Also, I run the java.util.Date object through GWT's formatter in several other places where I have a date in hand but never have this issue..... It comes when I run it in a ValueChangeHandler.

962515,Validity of JavaScript Type Parameters?,"Recently I stumbled across that JavaScript allows you to pass an object or array as the key to an object parameter. ex: will make return From looking further into this, it seems like internally the object's method is being called and passed as the actual key. In the above example this actually breaks apart as that means what is really happening is is being set, meaning that any standard object passed in would access the same key. However, I decided to expand upon this by creating custom objects which would cause their method to instead return their constructor. This would mean that it would return a unique key for each object type. Based on this, I created the following example of using this technique to create relatively clean implementation of a type parameter: In this example will return and will return . This could be used with native JavaScript types as well (String, Number, etc). This seems to work standard across all 5 major browsers (chrome, firefox, ie, safari, opera). I was wondering if there is some glaring flaw that I am not seeing in this technique, or if this is perhaps a valid way of implementing a type parameter?

I've tested 5 different ram disk softwares (ImDisk, SoftPerfect RAM Disk, QSoft RAMDisk, Datagram RamDisk, SuperSpeed RAMDisk Plues).

However, when big files are copied from ram-disk to ram-disk (e.g. a file of 500MB) - the speed is good - 600MB/sec.

1085759,Best way to render/animate 2d using openGL?,"So I'm making a game in C++. And I'm at a fork in the road. I am now planning how I am going to handle animation and optimize rendering. I'm rendering using immediate mode which I was told was very slow. I go looking for alternatives and then there's a bunch of different ways, and it differs depending on how you handle the animations, so I thought I'd just ask what would be a good optimal way to do both. For animations, I thought about using sequences of images stored in memory, but only testing with a 50 image sequence, memory jumped to like 200 mb, when it was 30 before. (There's no leak, it stays at 200, but if I have large levels, it looks like I'll be running out of memory). Would sprite sheets help in this case? I was told the reason atlases or sprite sheets were used was because binding different textures was an expensive operation, so the only way this would work is by putting in all the texture I will use for level 1 for example in one huge texture so I'm only binding once. Is this possible dynamically? Would using one gigantic PNG be better memory-wise than loading 50 PNG's?

Adding to this, after typing anything in the text fields of the project forms, the undo menu item title dynamically changed to “Undo Typing”. The same happens for “Redo” also. I can set the titles of other menu and menuitems' title using, for MainMenu.xib ""Edit"" menu and similarly, for NSMenuItem ""Copy"" which is in under ""Edit"" menu.

Is it possible to manually get the First responder of the MainMenu.xib and from that get the undomanager object?

1191435,"Lookup class use enum, struct, public const, something else?","I'm creating a lookup class so a constant value will be used throughout all the projects. The thing is, there are several solutions to create such a thing. I could create a single class with enums, structs or constants in it or create a single class for every 'object'. I'm wondering what would be the best solution. First I thought doing something like this: But personally I don't like using strings in enums that much. Another option would be to use a struct, which is even more ugly if you see the code: This looks a bit better, but could be confusing when having a lot of options: While typing this post, I think this will be the best/clean option: Any other suggestions? Filling up the project with several classes which only define some constants seem to me like a lot of overhead and clutter. Edit It wasn't very clear in the original context, but the lookup values aren't limited to only strings. Some very good suggestions below are only possible when you use only strings, but Int's, DateTime and other types need to be supported also. Got some nice ideas from the answers here, I'll try out which one will work best in my current project. Final implemented solution Thanks to the suggestions below, I've implemented the lookup classes like this: This is based on an answer given below.

I am planning on using the MySql Migration toolkit to first convert the Sql Server database to MySql. Then I want to pull the data from the old database to the new. I have broken down the database into conceptually independent sections that can be migrated independently. This is where i'm not sure what to do. Do I just have to write sql scripts to transfer? These scripts would contain big cursors to transfer the data e.g. I have a list of Organizations and users linked to the organizations. Should I write a cursor to insert each organization and users in turn into the new database or are there tools to help me do this? Thanks in advance.,[],True

When I click on a push button in one GUI, the second GUI will invoke, and both GUIs both can work in parallel. If any body knows answer to this question please give reply to me. I have two GUI forms.

This is my recursion: public void createTree( State presentState ) { if( !gameIsEnd(presentState) &amp;&amp; presentState.getTreeDepth() &lt; maxDepth ) { int size = presentState.getRows().size(); //I store the rows as ArrayList&lt;ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;&gt;.

I have a news application that starts on a Splash Screen (To fetch the news feeds and cache them) then it switches to the main screen which is a mash-up of news articles. You can navigate from this screen to many other screens by clicking on the articles, sections, galleries, videos, etc...I have a fixed header and a footer which I decided to subclass a master UIViewController and place those on that (I'll inherit this UIViewController in my other UIViewControllers) I've read that the best way to do this is by having multiple view controllers each controlling a specific section of my application. However I'm still a bit confused about how to switch between those properly and responsibly. I tried the storyboard segues but I ran into two problems: I need to create a lot of segues since you can virtually jump from any screen to any other screen The segues will not preserve the state of the UIViewController once you jump to another one and once you go back it's reset to it's initial state. I have also read about the presentModalViewController with which you can push your view as a modal on top of the current controller. However you need to do this a lot and I'm a bit afraid about memory consumption issues. What's the best way to create a multi-view application without an application view hiearchy (UINavigationController/UITabController/etc...) Typically I'd like to declare all my view controllers at the start and just switch between them as needed (when I first need a view I'll initialize it) Anyone tried something similar before? Thanks a lot. EDIT: Thanks for the replies, I went out and watched WwDC session about UIViewController containment and that helped me in understanding how to implement a custom UIViewController container. However there's still something I can't grasp. When I create a custom UIViewController container I need to add children to it using addChildViewController, and that will fire the willMoveToParentController event on my child UIViewController. Then I add the child controllers subviews into the container views using [self.view addSubview...] however this only load the views and doesn't link them to the events I have created inside my child UIViewController. Should I use something else than addSubview? or should I use a separate UIView class to wire my events in?",[],False

1645670,Windows Server backup / disaster recovery best practice for small shop?,"I work for a small school that has two Windows 2003 servers. I'm trying to get a grip on cost-effective strategies to handle the failure of one or both servers. I come from a UNIX background, so I understand the various strategies and trade-offs I might use in that world, but I have only about 8 months worth of experience in the Windows server world. Right we have Norton Backup Exec 12 doing backups to two separate low-end CIFS NAS boxes. Each NAS box has a full set of backups. All this was set up before I started with this school. My real goal is to take an old server box and use the backups to do a restore, both to demonstrate that the backups work and so that I can document the process in the event of a real failure. Another goal I've been given is to get an off-site backup. My idea was to setup a Linux box, take a local copy of all the files written by Norton Backup on one of of the CIFS NASes, then move that Linux box out of the building and keep it up to date with rsync. But the NAS boxes don't support rsync, and so far I haven't been able to get Norton Backup Exec to do a backup to a local Linux box running SAMBA. (I'm assuming that it is best to do an rsync of the Norton Backup files because Norton Backup keeps track of NTFS permissions and any other Windows metadata that might be lost by trying to rsync directly from Windows Server to Linux.) Other Requirements/Constraints: The two servers each have 500 gig of RAID 1 storage. A full backup of both servers using Backup Exec takes about 650 gig. We can afford to be down for a day or so - long enough to do a full restore if needed. We can't afford an off-site stand-by server. We have some older server boxes that we can use to make this all work. We have a business class cable internet connection with about 2mbits upload - fast enough to do some incremental backup out to an off-site server over night. Is Norton Backup Exec the reasonable way to go? I don't know much about it, and it certainly isn't helping with the off-site incremental backup problem. Will Norton Backup handle a bare-metal restore? Our support contract with Norton has expired, so I can't get any help on this from them without more money. Given my constraints, is there a better way to handle this? Is there a better backup package or strategy suited to our small shop needs?",[],False

We came up with a different solution to store all of the data in xml fields thus solving most of the problem. It now exists similar to this. Then we would create views to pull this data out of the table Now this is much better than we had before but it also means that we still need to create the custom view each time.

Usually we store some user specific data in the client side using cookie, which will be sent to server during later requests. However, it's possible that we store these data in server side storage.

HttpOnly should really be default unless explicitly intended for JavaScript access. Third, some mobile devices currently do not support cookies.

I don't like the term ""old"" because it seems a little prejudiced (especially to HR!) and it doesn't accurately reflect what I mean. We are a company that does primarily .NET development using TDD in an Agile environment, we use Git as a source control system, we make heavy use of OSS tools and projects and we contribute to them as well, we have a strong bias towards adhering to strong Object-Oriented principles, SOLID, etc, etc, etc... Now, the normal list of questions that we ask doesn't really seem to apply to applicants that are fresh out of school, nor does it seem to apply to these ""legacy"" programmers. Here is how I (loosely) define a ""legacy"" programmer. Spent a significant amount of their career working almost exclusively with Assembly/Machine Languages. Primary accomplishments include work done with TANDEM systems. Has extensive experience with technologies like FoxPro and ColdFusion It's not that we somehow think that what we do is ""better"" than what they do, on the contrary, we respect these types of applicants and we are scared that we may be missing a good candidate. It is just very difficult to get a good read on someone who is essentially speaking a different language than you. To someone like this, it seems a little strange to ask a question like: What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface? Because, I would think that they would almost never know the answer or even what I'm talking about. However, I don't want to eliminate someone who could be a very good candidate in their own right and could be able to eventually learn the stuff that we do. But, I also don't want to just ask a bunch of behavioral questions, because I want to know about their technical background as well. Am I being too naive? Should ""legacy"" programmers like this already know about things like TDD, source control strategies, and best practices for object-oriented programming? If not, what questions should we ask to get a good representation about whether or not they are still able to learn them and be able to keep up in our fast-paced environment? EDIT: I'm not concerned with whether or not applicants that meet these criteria are in general capable or incapable, as I have already stated that I believe that they can be 100% capable. I am more interested in figuring out how to evaluate their talents, as I am having a hard time figuring out how to determine if they are an A+ ""legacy"" programmer or if they are a D- ""legacy"" programmer.

1823672,Proof that $\sqrt{5}$ is irrational,"In my textbook the following proof is given for the fact that $\sqrt{5}$ is irrational: $ x = \frac{p}{q}$ and $x^2 = 5$. We choose $p$ and $q$ so that the have no common factors, so we know that $p$ and $q$ aren't both divisible by $5$. $$\left(\dfrac{p}{q}\right)^2 = 5\\ \text{ so } p^2=5q^2$$ This means that $p^2$ is divisble by 5. But this also means that $p$ is divisible by 5. $p=5k$, so $p^2=25k^2$ and so $q^2=5k^2$. This means that both $q$ and $p$ are divisible by 5, and since that can't be the case, we've proven that $\sqrt{5}$ is irrational. What bothers me with this proof is the beginning, in which we choose a $p$ and $q$ so that they haven't got a common factor.

1859001,Parsing different xml messages. Versions,"Say we want to Parse a XML messages to Business Objects. We split the process in two parts, namely: -Parsing the XML messages to XML Grammar Objects. -Transform XML Objects to Business Objects. The first part is done automatically, generation a grammar object for each node. The second part is done following the XML architecture so far. Example: If we have the XML Message(Simplified): We could find the following classes: The main problem arrives when we need to handle versions of the same messages. Say we have a new version where only DecodeInnerChild changes(e.g.: We need to add an ""a"" at the end of the value) It is really important that the solutions agile for further versions and as clean as possible. I considered the following options: 1)Simple Inheritance:Create two classes of DecodeInnerChild. One for each version. Shortcomming: I will need to create different classes for every parent class to call the right one. 2)Version Parameter: Add to each method an Object with the version as a parameter. This way we will know what to do within each method according to each version. Shortcoming: Not clean at all. The code of different versions is mixed. 3)Inheritance + Version Parameter: Create 2 classes with a base class for the common code for the nodes that directly changes (Like InnerChild) and add the version as a parameter in each method. When a node call the another class to decode the child object, it will use one or another class depending on the Version parameter. 4)Some kind of executor pattern(I do not know how to do it): Define at the start some kind of specifications object, where all the methods that are going to be used are indicated and I pass this object to a class that is in charge of execute them. How would you do it? Other ideas are welcomed.

I think I may have specified that the nameserver for iodine.ninjanet.info is iodine.ninjanet.info, so a circular dependency is created whereby a user must resolve iodine.ninjanet.info in order to resolve iodine.ninjanet.info (can someone confirm?). To my great surprise, if I perform ""dig z11.iodine.ninjanet.info"", the DNS server responds with a CNAME record (ie. somehow, dig was able to get an answer from my iodine server).

My question is whether it is allowed to output a functional group without any messages inside it (as opposed to not outputting the UNG/UNE segments at all)? I have tried looking over the internet on this issue but I have yet to find any clarification on this specific point. To add some context, my scenario is an interchange with four types of messages grouped functionally. One of these groups contains a message for each underlying item in the database. If the database has no records, then no messages will be output for that group. In this case the group will be empty. Do you create an empty UNG/UNE block or do you not create the block at all?

This is how it should work in theory. However, I have found that for some browsers (firefox and IE, untested on others) this is not the case. If the user navigates to a new page with cached, etagged images, these browsers simply use the image out of their cache without making a request. If the user then refreshes the page, the browser sends a request with the header set. So my problem is this: a user updates one of their images, then navigates to a page displaying the image. Until the user presses , the cached image will be displayed, even though it has a different etag to the new image. When the user presses refresh, the browser does a request with the header set, which triggers the server to send the new image. Is it possible to fix this?

I have attempted the following problem four times and got four completely different answers. $$\int_0^1\int_1^2\int_0^{x+y}12(4x+y+3z)^2 dz dy dx$$ to my understanding, the first integral should equal: $$\frac{4}{3}(7x+4y)^3$$ The second would be: $$\frac{1}{12}(7x+8)^4-\frac{1}{12}(7x+4)^4$$ And the final integral: $$\frac{1}{420}(7+8)^5-\frac{1}{420}(7+4)^5$$ or 1424.59 Again I've tried several different methods receiving different answers, each marked as wrong on the homework website.

2024603,Save ArrayList to file - FC when creating ObjectOutputStream,"I'm trying to implement some simple caching into my application and I'm having some issues. Basically my code scrapes a webpage, gets some regex matches and puts them into an ArrayList. This takes a while to do (a few seconds, but this happens frequently) so I'm trying to implement a simple caching system which checks when the cache file was modified, if this is older than a week, refresh cache.

I originally have (which works) Now what I'm trying to modify this to be is this (in theory, as it currently doesn't work) Note: I'm trying to save multiple files as this method is called for various different categories.

2075675,Two different login forms in Symfony 2,"Background According to the Symfony documentation the login form needs to be specified on the security.yml file, also hes login_check path. Until now my app is working fine, users tries to access a secure page (mysite.com/edit/123) next if they are not logged they will be redirected to /login and after they login they will be redericted again to the original intended path (/edit/123). Similar question: Two separate login pages in Symfony 2 Problem The problem now is, i need a different login form, lets say /minimal_login, i need to include that on the security.yml but the only way i know is creating a different firewall, and as i saw on the documentation this creates a separate identification scheme, so i suppose users logged by differents firewall can not share the same secured pages, and thats not what i want. What is need If the user tries to access any secure page but /popup they will be redirected to /login, BUT if they tries to access /popup (and they are not logged) they will be redirected to /minimal_login. And no matter how the user logs into my app, they will always share the same access, i mean, if they log in using /login or /minimal_login they can access the same pages.

2112015,storing state for displaying messages to users,"I'm just wanting to know what is the most common method of storing state for displaying messages to users after a form has been be submitted. When I handle the submission of the form, I will redirect to either the same page the user came from, or to a different page. The reason for the redirect is to prevent the refresh re-submitting the form. Generally, I don't have a dynamic error message that is passed, it's more just a flag to display the error message. So far, this has either been storing the message/flag in session session, so that on page load, it checks for the session variable, if it exists, then display the message. The pro for this is that I can easily customize the message if required. The downside is that I must clear the session variable after each use, which becomes repetitive. The other option has been to add a ?success=1 or similar query string to the page. The pro for this is that I don't have any tidying to do afterwards. The downside is that should I wish to customize the message, this also needs to be appended to the URL. Also, should I have any JavaScript functionality that generates links based on the current URL, I need to remove this from the URL. For example, if I had paging, I might have this on a success operation: domain.com/items?page=1&amp;success=1. At this stage, I feel that storing the messages in session are the way to go, as it offers more flexibility, however I just wanted to see if there were any other options to this.

2284234,NHibernate Rollback w/ broken rules (validation best practice),I'm working on a legacy system that is using the enterprise library validation block to add a broken rule when an object is not valid. Then the user is returned a message based on this error and told the object was not updated. The only issue is that now I'm using NHibernate to persist these objects -NHProf shows an update to the object when I commit the session. This is because the object has been modified I assume and the ORM is simply doing its job. My question is this - what would be the best way to check for these broken rules before I commit the session? Or should I not use Enterprise library and switch to something NHibernate friendly? Update I came across this event listener class for the NHibernate Validator Event Listener - my final implementation was very similar,[],False

2303030,"How can I ""import scipy.signal as signal"" and still use python sphinx autodoc?","I'm trying to use Sphinx to automatically generate documentation for a python project. One of the modules requires the scipy.signal package, which I try to import using the following: import scipy.signal as signal. Although the code runs just fine, making html with Sphinx results in a segmentation fault (output below). I can, however, use ""import scipy as sp"", making sure to put scipy directory in my sys.path and the documentation is generated without any problems, but of course, then I won't have the functionality in my code that I need. I made a very simple test case to demonstrate the problem, creating a testclass with a few docstrings. I am inluding it below along with my .rst's. Commenting out the line ""import scipy.signal as signal"", everything works quite well. Thanks for any insights into how to avoid seg faulting while still importing scipy.signal.

2320302,Completion of a metric space,"Let $R$ be a topological ring (i.e addition and product are continuous) which we assume it is metrizable with metric d and consider the completion $\hat{R}$ of the ring $R$ defined as the set of all classes of equivalent Cauchy sequences. Question: why is the completion of $\hat{R}$ (defined in this way) also a topological ring? It is certainly metrizable by the standard metric: $\hat{R}$, $\hat{d}([(x_{n})],[(y_{n})])=\operatorname{lim} d(x_{n},y_{n})$. To check addition is continuous: suppose $([(x_{n})],[(y_{n})])$ is a sequence of elements in $\hat{R} \times \hat{R}$ such that$([(x_{n})],[(y_{n})]) \rightarrow ([x],[y])$ then by by definition of convergence in a metric product space we have that: $[(x_{n})] \rightarrow [x]$ and $[(y_{n})] \rightarrow y$ Therefore $d(x_n,x) \rightarrow 0$ and $d(y_n,y) \rightarrow 0$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$. Since we are in metric spaces this says $x_{n} \rightarrow x$ and $y_{n} \rightarrow y$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$. By assumption $R \times R$ is continuous with respect addition so $x_{n} + y_{n} \rightarrow x+y$. But then $\hat{d}([(x_{n}+y_{n})])=[x+y]$ so we have that addition is continuous. Is this OK?",[],False

2328526,Communicate through TextWriter -> TextReader,"One way to have interprocess communication is through a (named) pipe between the processes. I want to achive the same ""queue""-like communication between two threads. The producer should write a text base command (using TextWriter or an output Stream). The consumer should read from the TextReader. Because, then you think about it, an OutputStream/-Writer is the other side of the coin of an InputStream/-Reader. So using a Writer to fill a Reader with data, that should be easy, in theory. (The standard way here is to have a Queue between the threads. However I wish to use TextReader and TextWriter, since I have existing code for front and backends already. This way it will be easy to debug by connecting the Console.In / Console.Out to the producer/consumer. ) I thought this would be really easy to just connect a writer to a reader, but I fail to find out how to do it. I could write one such connected myself, but it feels like it ""should"" already be there. Any ideas? Cheers Leif",[],False

I (wrongfully it seems) assumed that the handleBackgroundNotification API from the UAPushNotificationDelegate class would provide me the functionality to execute custom actions when receiving the notification when app is in the background. This is what their documentation says: ""handleBackgroundNotification: Called when a push notification is received when the application is in the background - (void)handleBackgroundNotification:(NSDictionary *)notification Parameters notification "" - see https://docs.urbanairship.com/ios-lib/Classes/UAPushNotificationHandler.html#//api/name/handleBackgroundNotification: Doesn't seem to work that way - sure seems the OS is keeping the notification for itself - which is inline with Apple's documentation. I am questioning the purpose of the function if the OS doesn't allow it. I use didReceiveRemoteNotification for receiving remote push notifications which works just fine! However, since this is an enterprise application (i.e. not App Store), if there are private APÏs and frameworks that would allow me to do this, I would appreciate any assistance. There is no way this app would ever make it to the app store!

2389493,What is the definition of a network in graph theory,"From Wikipedia a flow network (also known as a transportation network) is a directed graph where each edge has a capacity and each edge receives a flow. The amount of flow on an edge cannot exceed the capacity of the edge. A flow must satisfy the restriction that the amount of flow into a node equals the amount of flow out of it, except when it is a source, which has more outgoing flow, or sink, which has more incoming flow. Often in Operations Research, a directed graph is called a network, the vertices are called nodes and the edges are called arcs. From West's Introduction to Graph Theory's Appendix D Glossary and Terms Network [176]: a directed graph with a distinguished initial vertex (source) and a distinguished, terminal vertex (sink), in which each edge is assigned a flow capacity and possibly also a flow demand (lower bound). So I wonder what the definition for a network is? Must a network be directed? Both sources said so, but from my past intuition, a network can be undirected. Must a network have a weight or flow for each edge? Must a network have a capacity on the weight or flow for each edge? Wikipedia seems say no and only flow networks can have them, while West seemed to say yes. Must a network have a source vertex and a sink vertex? Wikipedia seems say no and only flow networks can have them, while West seemed to say yes. I understand that there may be different definitions by different people, including those not listed here. However, I would like to know what definition makes more sense and/or receives more consensus? Thanks!",[],False

2444099,Scheduler in Android for regular updates,"Okay, This was probably not the best title, so feel free to help me find a better one :) Anyway, I'm writing a little Android app which parses some information from the web once in a while. Currently it does so every X seconds. The code I use looks like this, and all the magic happens in do_stuff() of course. It works great, however, it's not flexible enough. In addition to be running every X seconds I would like the user to add a fixed update every morning at 8:00 AM. I guess I could write that logic into triggerNextTimer(long delay). However, this assumes the user defined event happens after triggerNextTimer(long delay) is called the next time. For instance, if triggerNextTimer(long delay) as default runs once a day, and the user defines the scheduled update once an hour this wont go into effect before the next day. Also, my current solution has the problem that if the user hits ""update"" manually, the scheduler might only be a few seconds from triggering, and it would be nice if my ""update"" button somehow included the scheduler - thus resetting it - isntead of just calling ""do_stuff()"" Any suggestions?","['private final Handler handler = new Handler() {\n    @Override\n    public void handleMessage(Message msg) {\n        switch (msg.what) {\n        case MSG_TIMER:\n            log.debug(""Message: MSG_TIMER."");\n\n            do_stuff();\n            triggerNextTimer(nextUpdate);\n\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n};\n\n\nprivate void triggerNextTimer(long delay) {\n    Message msg = Message.obtain();\n    msg.what = MSG_TIMER;\n    handler.sendMessageDelayed(msg, delay);\n}\n']",False

I typically equip my installations with JCE editor for my clients, but at design time, operate in HTML mode. When all the content was in, I decided to test WYSIWYG mode to make sure nothing went awry. Unfortunately, something did. Observe the lack of spaces: Very interesting that the problem occurs ONLY when saving from WYSIWYG view. At first I thought JCE was malfunctioning (although the editor itself continued to show spaces), so I tried reinstalling. Then I tried other editors -- CKEditor and TinyMCE. The same symptoms manifested with them as well. Trying to isolate the problem, I checked the database after pasting in clean markup in HTML view, and again after saving in WYSIWYG view. This is the result: So, based on the database field, it would appear that the process of saving, in either HTML or WYSIWYG view is working properly...

2719378,Automatically insert capital letters as alphabetical breakpoints in a sorted column of names,"Recently I used LyX to prepare a list with 200+ guest names for a wedding (page 1 illustrated below). Actually, it was a table including invited family names, the number of persons of each invited family, the number of the table given to the family and an alternative table number. The table was initially created in a spreadsheet and afterwards extracted as a file which was the basis for the final ""guest list"". The family names (1st column of the table) were already alphabetically sorted. Small caps were applied for family names, alternate table row-coloring (for a longtable within LyX), bold numbers referring to the tables and other font details. In addition, I manually inserted capital letters, just before family names started with a ""new"" letter, to give the sense of alphabetically grouped names and ease tracing them when the moments come were 50~100 people altogether, waiting in the entrance of the event hall, expect to be guided to their table. The question: is there a way to automatically insert single rows with capital letters as ""breakpoints"" (as shown in the attached page above) using a ""normal"", sorted, column of names? And how about automatically adding some custom command in each of the ""letter""-rows, like for example and in each following row?

It looks to be correctly rendering the HTML (onclick=""this.disabled=true;__doPostback...), and it is disabling correctly, but the problem is with the page validation. If any validation on the page has failed, its posting back and THEN showing the validation errors (where it should be done on client side without requiring a postback). Here's the code for the custom control. What am i doing wrong? EDIT Okay so i found part of the problem: Will not apply the dervied behaviour of the postbackoptions.

2730282,Rate of convergence of a sequence in $\mathbb{R}$ and Big O notation,"From Wikipedia $f(x) = O(g(x))$ if and only if there exists a positive real number $M$ and a real number $x_0$ such that $|f(x)| \le \; M |g(x)|\mbox{ for all }x&gt;x_0$. Also from Wikipedia Suppose that the sequence $\{x_k\}$ converges to the number $L$. We say that this sequence converges linearly to $L$, if there exists a number $μ ∈ (0, 1)$ such that $\lim_{k\to \infty} \frac{|x_{k+1}-L|}{|x_k-L|} = \mu$. If the sequences converges, and $μ = 0$, then the sequence is said to converge superlinearly. $μ = 1$, then the sequence is said to converge sublinearly. I was wondering Is it true that if $\{x_n\}$ either linearly, superlinearly or sublinearly converges to $L$, only if $|x_{n+1}-L| = O(|x_n-L|)$? This is based on what I have understood from their definitions and viewing $\{ x_{n+1}-L \}$ and $\{ x_n-L \}$ as functions of $n$. Note that ""only if"" here means ""if"" may not be true, since $\mu$ may lie outside of $[0,1]$ and $\{x_n\}$ may not converge. Some Optimization book says that the steepest descent algorithm has linear rate of convergence, and writes $|x_{n+1}-L| = O(|x_n-L|)$. Is the usage of big O notation here expanding the meaning of linear rate of convergence? Thanks and regards!",[],False

There are a standard set of features in my application that I want everyone to have (basic control of the hardware) My vision is for the standard set of features the product will have no have a serial number and no embedded keys. So the none of the restricted function[s] will work but all the standard stuff will work. The program will have a version number but no serial number in the about/help section If I need to enable the the restricted function[s] I compile the program using MSbuild with the serial number I generated for that customer on the command line. MSBuild will take the serial number and embed it where I can access it in my code I'm hoping it will end up in properties.settings file??? and put it in the var named serial number that would be blank by default. Now that MSBuild has put the serial number in the correct place I now want it to go look for the file serial#1_opt1.private with the private key[s] and put it/them somewhere? where I can access them......but hopefully not where they are easily found. When my application runs I use the private keys to encrypt ""something"" and if the user has the file[s] with the public keys he can decrypt that ""something"" which will allow him to use that particular option. If he has all the public key files for all the options then he can do anything I can to the hardware......as in screw it up so badly it has to be returned to the factory to be re-calibrated. Can some tell me if this is the correct approach? If not what would be the correct aproach? And if it is how how can I get MSBuild to do these tricks?",[],False

What I want to do is transform the result of the query from type Person to type PersonDto using AutoMapper before WebAPI converts the result to JSON. Does anybody know how I can do this?

It would appear that this question ASP.NET Web API return queryable DTOs? covers the same issue (see second response for a better answer), where the suggestion is to use AutoMapper at the end of the chain using a custom MediaTypeFormatter, however I have no idea how to do that based on the example I have seen.

I'm trying to do a batch upload of photos in my iPhone application. I have one script that's looping through a user's photos, and then for each photo, calls another script to do the upload. The script that does the upload needs to call back the script that's firing off each of the user's photos to signal success or failure. It's kind of weird, but it's like I need to be able to get the blocking feature of a synchronous call within the loop, but at the same time, the upload script is asynchronous. The code is very involved so I'll try to use pseudocode: Script one: Upload Script: My issue is that I'd like to have the asynchronous callbacks so I can check the upload status, but I really need to block for each photo and wait for it to get uploaded. Is there a simple way to do something like this? Should I be putting the thread to sleep, or should I just make the http call synchronous? If so, how to check for success?

My ideal tool would basically work like this: define that you want to manage service A, B and C on machine X, and service D, E, F on machine Y, etc. define dependencies between services on different boxes. Ideally, this sort of configuration should be exportable, so that we can reuse it in different environments (service names don't change). have a view that will show the state of all these services in realtime. allow one-click start/stop of the entire sequence.

I can access them from my own computer or even from a website hosted with another provider. The weird part (at least, the part I don't understand) is; one cannot call the other. Both services are located in a subfolder of the web root, at the same hierarchical level. Like wwwroot\serviceone and wwwroot\servicetwo. Both are marked as application folder in IIS en both have an almost similar web.config as shown below, only the names differ: Browsing to the .svc displays the well-known service page with the example code; The client has a method named HandleRequest(string str). So in my code (C#) there's a line like; The call doesn't raise an exception (I can tell because they are catched, handled and written to a database). It's like the message is sent but never returns. When I run this service (who calls the other) locally and leave the second on the remote server, all works well. Obvious it is hard to provide all the details from the hosting party. Unfortunate I don't have access to an IIS installation to simulate the environment either. So, I'm not expecting an in-depth technical solution based on the little information I can provide.

3327878,Coding Theory in PHP: Need to direct traffic for multiple queues (multiplexing),"I am putting together an interface for our employees to upload a list of products for which they need industry stat's (currently doing 'em manually one at a time). Each product will then be served up to our stat's engine via a webservice api. I will be replying. The Stat's-engine will be requesting the ""next victim"" from my api. Each list the users upload will have between 50 and 1000 products, and will be its own queue. For now, Queues/Lists will likely be added (&amp; removed via completion) aprox 10-20 times per day. If successful, traffic will probably rev up after a few months to something like 700-900 lists per day. We're just planning to go with a simple round-robin approach to direct the traffic evenly across queues. The multiplexer would grab the top item off of List A, then List B, then List C and so on until looping back around to List A again ... keeping in mind that lists/queues can be added/removed at any time. The issue I'm facing is just conceptualizing the management of this. I thought about storing each queue as a flat file and managing the rotation via relational DB (MySQL). Thought about doing it the reverse. Thought about going either completely flat-file or completely relational DB ... bottom line, I'm flexible.

Right now I just store settings using XML. The problem is that when my application needs to ACCESS a setting, it is literally accessing the UI directly (checkboxes, etc...)

Currently the connections are established over the Oracle JDBC-ODBC bridge driver and datasources are configured on operating system level (Windows Server 2008). My team recently suggested a migration to vendor specific JDBC4 drivers (which by the way are available for all used databases), but despite the widely known disadvantages in performance and functionality and the fact that Oracle explicitly states on its website that the JDBC-ODBC bridge is not suited for production and a last resort if no other driver is available, we faced some serious resistance coming from the current developers and the team responsible for operating the system. I was told that one of the requirements is to be able to reconfigure database connections at runtime. Currently this is done by just editing the datasources configured in the Windows ODBC tool while the application is running. As far as I know this is something that's not possible with container managed (JNDI) datasources. Also it sounds rather dangerous to me since the application is in an inconsistent state during the reconfiguration process.

EDIT: In answer to some comments... I'm not using MFC. The program is for my own use - the answer does not have to look pretty. The reason I don't just rely on the hourglass is that the hourglass only shows when the cursor is on top of the applications small window, and I work on a system with four very large monitors and the cursor is often not on the window in question.. If I don't see an hourglass then my program looks like its crashed. Its quite disturbing. I work on this program continuously as my job, and have done so for many years. The operation that takes a long time is performed only occasionally, I may go months without using it. So if it locks up doing this task I'm worried that I will have forgotten that its just busy and assume there's some bug and go on a wild goose chase trying to fix a problem that does not exist.",[],False

I just migrated from lighttpd and I'm noticing that during downloads, speeds fluctuate a lot very quickly. I'm familiar with fluctuating speeds, but not at this rate, lighttpd didn't fluctuate nearly as much. I was wondering if there were some general things I should look into, being new to nginx. Should I up the worker pool count, etc. I was going through the wiki page for the HttpCoreModule and I found something such as the option: The directive enables use of flags O_DIRECT (FreeBSD, Linux), F_NOCACHE (Mac OS X) or directio() function (Solaris) for reading files with size greater than specified. This directive disables use of sendfile for this request. This directive may be useful for big files would that be an option to try out? Thanks guys, I appreciate the help. I know my question may be pretty broad, but like I said, being new to nginx I'm wondering what kind of options I can look towards to optimize the server for file downloading.

But I guess it also means my server settings and installed applications are lost as they are just files in the same way as the other data. This means that I will either have to rewrite the whole app to use amazon CloudDB or write some code which stores the db on S3 and make my own AMI with the correct applications installed and configured.

It also has a subclass which is essentially used to add the id of the in-app product(s) to the IAHelper's array of products ids.

The style precedence values on the last four selectors are all (0,0,1,1): 1 class + 1 element. You get the expected transparent background for the first and third boxes (even on hover) because comes after and . You get pink on the second one because comes after . Cool (if I've misinterpreted the spec, let me know, but I think I'm on the money). But my question revolves around the semanticity of allowing selectors on parent elements have the same impact on specificity as selectors on the modified element. I feel that the class selector is definitely ""closer"" and more specific to the element than the class selector on the parent, and that the style declaration ""should"" have more precedence. Is there a way to actually make this so, or a philosophy I can follow to resolve the dissonance in my thinking? The actual application: I have option button styling that amounts to the following: Basically, the option buttons are gray and blue on hover. Now, I want to put these in a special area where I want the default behavior to have a transparent background: But now, this declaration takes precedence even over the , and I don't want it to. I still want its hover behavior to be the same; I just want the default background to be transparent. Of course, I can re-declare the hover styles, but this repeats that information, which is unideal. I have no problem sucking it up and just re-declaring it, which is what I'm doing now, but surely, there must be a way to get this to make sense in my head.","['a {\n    border: 1px solid black;\n    padding: 20px;\n    display: block;\n}\na.gray { background-color: gray; }\na:hover { background-color: teal; }\n.container a { background-color: transparent; }\na.pink { background-color: pink; }\n', '.container a', 'a.gray', 'a:hover', 'a.pink', '.container a', 'gray', 'container', 'a.gray', '.options a { background-color: gray; }\n.options a:hover { background-color: blue; }\n', '.env1 .subenv1 .options a { background-color: transparent; }\n', ':hover']",False

3705507,"Abstract Factory, Dependency Injection and good Design","I am trying to get the knack of good system design. As there is no hard and fast rules for good system design, I request you to give me some valuable suggestions. I prepared an imaginary system and prepared a design for that. Please let me know if you think if this design is good or bad. Is there a better way? I used Abstract Factory and Dependency Injection in the solution. Problem: Design a system which runs in cars and controls it. The requirement is to make a system for Volkswagen Golf controlling components like engine, electrical, gearbox etc. There can be different versions of Golf like BlueMotion, Twist, GT etc which uses different components. For example if GT uses engine a and electrical b, BlueMotion can use engine c and electrical d. The engines, electricals and other components in different cars could be similiar, or could be completely different. For example a ""Flat 4 CRDI"" Engine uses CRDI technology for fuel injection and have a certain behaviour to reduce vibration. A ""PumpeDuse V6"" engine uses PD injection and its own method for reducing vibration which is completely different from ""Flat4 CRDI"". The difference is not only in the handling the vibrations but also most of the aspects of Engine behaviour. As of now, the system model should handle the starting of Engine. Starting the engine means use power from the electrical system and crank the engine and keep idling. To start with, make a Golf ""GT"" with ""Pumpe Duse E250"" Engine and ""BoschR10"" Electrical system. However, many different series could be launched in the future and system should be able to extend the functionality and car models with minimal trouble. Update: Code edited as per suggestions. Code: Example for Creating Objects: Note that the names like ""BoschR10"" are imaginary.","['class Electrical\n{\npublic:\n    virtual void OpenCircuit() = 0;\n};\n\nclass Engine\n{\npublic:\n    virtual void Crank(Electrical *) = 0;\n};\n\nclass CarComponentFactory\n{\npublic:\n    virtual Engine* CreateEngine()=0;\n    virtual Electrical* CreateElectrical()=0;\n};\n\nclass PumpeDuseE250:public Engine\n{\n    virtual void Crank(Electrical *pEle)\n    {\n        pEle-&gt;OpenCircuit();\n        //Do the crank\n    }\n};\n\nclass BoschR10: public Electrical\n{\n    virtual void OpenCircuit()\n    {\n        //Open the Circuit\n    }\n};\n\nclass GTFactory:public CarComponentFactory\n{\npublic:\n    virtual Engine* CreateEngine()\n    {\n        return new PumpeDuseE250();\n    }\n\n    virtual Electrical* CreateElectrical()\n    {\n        return new BoschR10();\n    }\n};\n\nclass VWGolf\n{\n    auto_ptr&lt;Engine&gt; mpEngine;\n    auto_ptr&lt;Electrical&gt; mpElectrical;      \npublic:\n    VWGolf(Engine *pEngine, Electrical *pElectrical):mpEngine(pEngine), mpElectrical(pElectrical)\n    {\n    }\n\n    void Start()\n    {\n        mpEngine-&gt;Crank(mpElectrical.get());\n    }\n\n    ~VWGolf()\n    {           \n    }\n};\n', 'void main()\n{\n    GTFactory Factory;\n    VWGolf golfGT(Factory.CreateEngine(), Factory.CreateElectrical());\n    golfGT.Start();\n}\n']",False

Right now, I'm playing around with different numbers for the size of that chunk, to see what size is the most efficient. When testing on the localhost, any chunk size seems to work fine. But when I tested it over the network, it seems like the maximum chunk size is 8191 bytes. If I try anything higher, the transfer becomes extremely, painfully, slow. To show what happens, here are the first 100 lines of Wireshark logs when I use a chunk size of 8191 bytes, and when I use a chunk size of 8192 bytes: (the sender is 192.168.0.102, and the receiver is 192.168.0.100) 8191: http://pastebin.com/E7jFFY4p 8192: http://pastebin.com/9P2rYa1p Notice how in the 8192 log, on line 33, the receiver takes a long time to ACK the data. This happens again on line 103 and line 132. I believe this delay is the root of the problem. Note that I have not modified the SO_SNDBUF option nor the TCP_NODELAY option. So my question is, why am I getting delayed ACKs when sending files in chunks of 8192 bytes, when everything works fine when using chunks of 8191 bytes?",[],False

I must say the last hour I spent trying to figure it out (in vain), made believe the code does not work due to an error I haven't got the knowledge to solve - and that's why I'm here. My request to you is this: Could you tell me why would this code not work for big numbers, even though it works well for smaller ones?

3816369,Can Entity Framework context be reused all the time in code?,"In this question I was having problem with saving objects that had foreign keys because were build from multiple connected to each other thru foreign keys but they were loaded using different context each time.

Then there would be code to save it (simplified): Usually after trying to save it there would be multiple error messages An object with the same key already exists in the ObjectStateManager. The ObjectStateManager cannot track multiple objects with the same key. or The relationship between the two objects cannot be defined because they are attached to different ObjectContext objects and few others.

So far, it's been working nicely without issues. In fact, the problem I have with it doesn't really hinder it's functionality, but I'm concerned about performance. The problem is that in certain cases, PHP runs the same command multiple times (3 times in my case), even if it was supposed to only do this once. Note the commented line (line 9). That was for testing. I enabled it to ensure the target program only runs once (I was thinking my code may be calling the same function somehow). But even with that line enabled, the program still ran multiple times. As it is, I have 2 places in my code where I'm executing the same program (on different occasions).

4086732,Flow (or block) diagram tips?,"I've been working on a flow diagram or block diagram using Tikz to show a simplified camera transfer function. I've gotten as far as the code below, but I have a few questions remaining. I started with this example, which uses a matrix for node layout. Please let me know if that was a bad starting point. My questions are as follows How on earth do you make a simple square that won't deform when you put stuff in it, or at least will stay square. For the first block, I just wanted a square with a horizontal line through it. This turned complicated and I couldn't do it without a new tikz picture within the matrix, and even then there was some extra space after the node before the beginning of the arrow leaving it so I had to use negative space to remove it. Is there an easier way to do this? I found I couldn't just scale the Integral symbol because it's a math symbol which wants to resize itself. I had to use bigints package to do this. Is there some way via Tikz to just scale a symbol or text like that? So I could use a normal and scale it with Tikz? In the the second-last block (empty right now), I would like a line similar to the first block, but that goes up in little steps like a stairway (specifically, like an ADC transfer function). Is there a way to do this? I thought maybe a sawtooth wave rotated 90 degrees or something. Why do the connecting lines seem to continue slightly past the end of the arrows so that the arrow tips are not sharp?

However, when I access it via my SqlDataReader and put it into my DataTable, it ends up formatting as: 5/1/2011 12:00:00 AM. So I figured I could just explicitly parse it as an OracleDateTime. I have the following column in my DataTable: As well as this bit where I am reading the results: I also tried SqlDateTime for kicks, but ultimately, I end up with the same incorrectly formatted string.

4132975,MySQL/Classic ASP - Using LIMIT for paging,"I have encountered a problem with my build. I was using a very old method for recordset paging, that did not use the method, LIMIT. I have now used the LIMIT method, which has speeded up my page immensely... but it has affected another part of my page and I'm too sure how I can get around it. Before, I would run a query like this (example only): Even though this query would now return 69,000+ photos from London, I would then write all theses results (photoID INT INDEX, userID INT INDEX) to a table (searchResults), so the results could be used in other parts of the page. So I have this: Okay, now further in to my page, I want to show a list of the people in the photographs, along with the count, that are in all those results just stored. This enables my user to narrow the results to something more specific. For example, somebody could search for ""Golden Globe Awards"", the photos return and they can see a list of people that were at the Golden Globes, such as, Brad pitt (8,374), Angelina Jolie (7,321) etc etc. So I have this query which does just that: But now, because my DB has grown over the last year, my search for ""London"" could return 69,000 rows, so it takes a little too long to search the rows and write the rows to my results table. So I was advised to use LIMIT paging, where instead of returning 69,000 rows, it would only return the amount required for that page, like 20. I have now changed my page to use LIMIT, but as you can probably work out, I've lost the functionality of my list of peoples names that attended that event. Instead of Brad Pitt (8,374), it is now Brad Pitt (20) and Angelina Jolie (20)... which is just no good. So this is my dilemma, I want (need) to use LIMIT to speed up my page but it takes away the list of peoples names, which I also really want. If I do not use LIMIT, my search is too slow on the more common words - it seems I can't win! Is there anybody that could advise me on how to get around this? I hope I explained it well...","[""SELECT photoID FROM photoSearch WHERE country = 'London'\n"", 'While NOT rs.EOF\nINSERT INTO searchResults (photoID, userID) VALUES (""&amp;photoID&amp;"",""&amp;userID&amp;"")\nrs.MoveNext\nWend\n', 'SELECT COUNT(*) AS totalPeople, people FROM people\nINNER JOIN photopeople ON photoPeople.peopleID = people.PeopleID\nINNER JOIN searchPhotoResults ON photopeople.photoid  = searchPhotoResults.photoID\nGROUP BY people\nORDER BY totalPeople DESC\nLIMIT 5\n']",False

My site is served by two Unicorn workers. Last night I was uploading a batch of about 30 images at once. It looks like Chrome will do 6 simultaneously and it got through about half the batch before this started showing up in my : The rest of my image uploads timed out and Unicorn restarted itself. I could upload again, but doing multiples at once kept causing this error (and much more frequently after the first time it happened--I could sometimes get it to deadlock when uploading two files at the same time). I'm hoping for some ideas as to where to start troubleshooting. What part of the request is being deadlocked? None of my Rails code shows anywhere in that stack so I assume it's happening in the hardcore request logic which makes me think it won't be an easy fix. Should I fall back to something less event-driven like Mongrel for my file uploads? I assume that means you'll only be able to upload as many files simultaneously as there are instances of mongrel running, but at least the whole site won't go down if someone uploads a huge batch of files (which I'm hoping will be a common occurrence). Thanks for any help! Update I'm seeing the ImageMagick command locking quite a bit...I'm not sure how the internals of Rack works when you've got a request that's ""stuck"" on the server.

I've been trying to accomplish this with strictly SQL and I'm having incorrect (yet expected) results. I've got some pretty hefty queries, and I apologize if they're pretty far fetched. This first query was set up using AND statements for all the conditions. I realized that it doesn't work, as NULL values in the database still don't get picked up by wildcards. My second attempt checks for null values. This works a little better, except if you enter ""Jim"" as the project manager, it also returns all records with null as a project manager value.

I was reading a paper where the authors showed a result for all continuous functions and then just proceeded to write ""the usual limiting Argument gives the result for all bounded functions"" - so I am asking myself what this ""usual limiting argument"" might be. I do not know whether they mean uniform or pointwise convergence. As I see it pointwise convergence should suffice :D Thus I was am wondering whether there is a theorem having or leading to the following statement: Let $K\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ be compact. Any bounded measurable function $f:K\to\mathbb{R} $ can be approximated by a sequence of continuous functions $(g_m)$ on $K$. Nate Eldredge suggested that I post some excerpt from the original to provide more context for the problem. Here I go: The goal is to proof the existence of a weak limit for a tight sequence of probability measures on $\mathcal{C}^0([0,1]^2,\mathbb{R})$ associated with reflecting Brownian Motions on the compact the set $[0,1]^2$ which is a Lipshitz Domain. Thus we already, know that some weak limit must exist and it remains to show that two limit-Points agree. Weak-Convergence is generally defined via bounded measurable functions. Now let $P'$ and $P''$ be two subsequential limit points. The authors show that $f \in \mathcal{C}^0([0,1]^2,\mathbb{R})$ the following holds (here $X_s$ the canonical process) $E'f(X_s)=E''f(X_s)$ And now comes the actual source of my question: ""The usual limiting argument gives the result for bounded $f$ and hence the one-dimensional distributions agree."" (the second part I understand only the ""standard limiting argument thing"" is somewhat confusing) Any Help is much appreciated and Thanks in Advance :D",[],False

4574149,JDBC SQL Server Database Migrations,"I'm working on a Java web application (Adobe Flex front-end, JPA/Hibernate/BlazeDS/Spring MVC backend) and will soon reach the point where I can no longer wipe the database and regenerate it. What's the best approach for handling changes to the DB schema? The production and test databases are SQL Server 2005, dev's use MySQL, and unit tests run against an HSQLDB in-memory database. I'm fine with having dev machines continue to wipe and reload the DB from sample data using Hibernate to regenerate the tables. However, for a production deploy the DBA would like to have a DDL script that he can manually execute. So, my ideal solution would be one where I can write Rails-style migrations, execute them against the test servers, and after verifying that they work be able to write out SQL Server DDL that the DBA can execute on the production servers (and which has already been validated to work agains the test servers). What's a good tool for this? Should I be writing the DDL manually (and just let dev machines use Hibernate to regenerate the DB)? Can I use a tool like migrate4j (which seems to have limited support for SQL Server, if at all)? I'm also looking to integrate DB manipulation scripts into this process (for example, converting a ""Name"" field into a ""First Name"", ""Last Name"" field via a JDBC script that splits all the existing strings).

But I'd like a clearer answer to In C++11 standard (not draft), is the thread-safe initialization behavior finalized?

Poking around, I've found software like http://www.ranorex.com/mobile-automation-testing/android-test-automation.html that can automate the testing/config of a single app that the software itself installs. It's all graphical, so you just start recording, and the software records all the touches and button presses. You can play this back on any devices connected to your WiFi network. What I'm trying to do is similar to that software, but can be used outside of a single app, system modifications. Say I want to ensure that 1000 devices are all configured similarly, backlight settings, WiFi, GPS, etc.. Mainly the stuff that MDM cannot push OTA. None of the apps on the Play Store seem to do what I'm needing (all very consumer, single device focused) It looks like monkeyrunner could possibly work, but we don't have any programmers with Python knowledge in-house.

From the application point of view, only the big method needs to be public, and the other should be private. Yet, testing the private methods results in an easier to test class. How should I approach this problem?",[],False

If I open a c++ (main.cpp) file, the project gets contaminated with errors. main.cpp is a file having java as well as c++ code in it. and already included in my project. (closing the project and then reopening it solves the errors for the time being) Problems are: 1) how to open existing c++ files in a working android project? 2) how to tell eclipse that it's a mixed code/project of c++ as well as java. and not an error thanks.",[],False

After working with traditional ASP.NET model for so long, it's taking some time for me to get to understand this model. I am going through NerdDinner to understand how things work.

4689223,Using Boost.Asio with other serial devices like SPI,"Boost.Asio uses a Proactor to magnificently handle I/O using a single thread. I used it with sockets and I love it. I see that there is a way to use the io_service of Boost.Asio (and the underlying Proactor) with serial ports (COMX devices on Windows and /dev/ttyXXX on Linux) instead of sockets. In fact, I think that Boost.Asio is meant to be used with whatever type of I/O, including file handle and so on. I am wondering if I can use it directly, out-of-the-box, for any serial devices like SPI or I2C. These kind of serial devices appear like /dev/spi under Linux. For example, could I use it like this: and automagically, it works just like a regular serial port (i.e. RS232)? Alternatively, if SPI is not directly supported by Boost.Asio, do the later offers a way of easily incorporate support for any other device type, without modifying the core code of Boost.Asio?","['boost::asio::io_service my_io_service;\nboost::asio::serial_port my_spi_serial_port(""/dev/spi0"", my_io_service);\n']",False

4704853,Extending a control (ComboBox) in silverlight,I have a simple problem. I am trying to add a dependency property to a combo box. I want to be able to display a value on the face of the combo box when it is initially displayed. There is a ContentPresenter with a TextBlock inside the ComboBox. That TextBlock gets set when a user selects an item in the ComboBox. How can I set that with a default value (not one of the items)? Show something like 'choose one'. I can extend the ComboBox with a 'DefaultDisplay' dependency property but how do I 'link' that property to the TextBlock that is part of the control template? Thanks for any help on this.

4767467,How to prioritize write() over mmap updates (or delay mmap page cache flush),"I'm running a specialized DB daemon on a debian-64 with 64G of RAM and lots of disk space. It uses an on-disk hashtable (mmaped) and writes the actual data into a file with regular write() calls. When doing really a lot of updates, a big part of the mmap gets dirty and the page cache tries to flush it to disk, producing lots of random writes which in turn slows down the performance of the regular (sequential) writes to the data file. If it were possible to delay the page cache flush of the mmaped area performance would improve (I assume), since several (or all) changes to the dirty page would be written at once instead of once for every update (worst case, in reality of course it aggregates a lot of changes anyway). So my question: Is it possible to delay page cache flush for a memory-mapped area? Or is it possible to prioritze the regular write? Or does anyone have any other ideas? madvise and posix_fadvise don't seem to make any difference...",[],False

5116673,How can a graphics card be optimized for WPF 'Dirty Rectangle' update rate,"I'm trying to write an application to display multiple video streams, all updating at 25 or 30 images per second. The images are being rendered into WPF controls using Direct3D and some Interop to avoid using a Winforms control. As more video streams are added, the frame rate of each control drops yet the CPU on my machine only ever reaches about 50%. Using the Microsoft WPF Performance Suite - Perforator tool, it would appear that when the frame rate on the video streams starts to drop, the 'Dirty Rect Addition Rate' levels out like it has reached a maximum for the video card. There is no software rendering activity in the application so it would appear that overall performance is being limited by the graphics card's ability to update the Dirty Rectangles. Therefore, is there a feature or performance parameter that can be used to determine the best video card to buy in order to maximise performance for my application? Either that, or is there a set of graphics cards settings that will boost performance?

5167010,Higher-order and black-box clustering,"As far as I understand a large number of clustering problems can be formulated as: $\underset{\textbf{P}}{ \text{argmin}} \; \sum_{i,j} f \left(x_i, x_j\right)$ where $\textbf{P}$ is a partitioning of $\mathbf{x}$. In other words, the goal is to find a partitioning that is optimal with respect to a sum of pairwise contributions of the variables within and/or across clusters. Problems such as K-means and correlation clustering can be written in the above form. For example, K-means minimizes the sum-of-squares which is known to be NP-hard. I am wondering if there is any work on what I informally would call higher-order or clustering, where the functions $f$ measure the affinity of general cliques of variables $\underset{\textbf{P}}{\text{argmax}}\; \sum_{c_i} f(\mathbf{x}_{c_i})$ for cliques $c_i$ in some set $C$. Perhaps a more difficult problem is what I would informally call black-box clustering, i.e. problems of the above form where $f$ is unknown (i.e. we don't have access to an algebraic or analytical expression of $f$, but we can query it.

5217254,Solving multiple instances of 3SUM generated from the same set,"(this is a follow-up of my previous question, which uses the 3SUM' problem instead of 3SUM) Suppose we have a list $S$ of $n$ integers. Usually, for 3SUM, we only determine if there exist $a$,$b$,$c$ $\in S$ such that $a+b+c=0$. That's done in $O(n^2)$, and obviously the same thing can be done for $a+b+c=d$, with $d$ an integer. Now, I use a somewhat modified version of this problem. Someone randomly picks $n$ triplets of elements of $S$, and for each of them, computes the sum of its elements. Let's call the list of these sums $Y$. That's $n$ instances of 3SUM built on the same set. My goal is to invert one element of $Y$., i.e. is to find one element in $Y$, along with its corresponding elements in $S$. (To solve one of the possible instances of 3SUM, no matter which one) I'm looking for a $O(n)$ solution. If we feed this solution some particular $S$ and $Y$ ,and we want to find a particular $d$ in $Y$, it would take the solution $O(n)$ attempts to find the $d$ we're looking for, thus running in $O(n^2)$, which is the 3SUM complexity. I tried to use randomness in my solutions, without success. Someone also advised me to have a look at FFTs, but I can't see how I could use them in this case. The best that I can do now, is to have $Y$ built with $n^{1.5}$ triplets instead of $n$, and then I can use the birthday paradox. If I pick $O(n^{1.5})$ triplets at random, I have a constant probability to find the same triplet twice. ($n^{1.5} = \sqrt{n^3}$)",[],False
5217843,Need help understanding FFT output,"I need some help understanding the output of the DFT/FFT computation. I'm an experienced software engineer and need to interpret some smartphone accelerometer readings, such as finding the principal frequencies. Unfortunately, I slept through most of my college EE classes fifteen years ago, but I've been reading up on DFT and FFT for the last several days (to little avail, apparently). Please, no responses of ""go take an EE class"". I'm actually planning to do that if my employer will pay me. :) So here is my problem: I've captured a signal at 32 Hz. Here is a 1 second sample of 32 points, which I've charted in Excel. I then got some FFT code written in Java from Columbia University (after following the suggestions in a post on ""Reliable and fast FFT in Java""). The output of this program is as follows. I believe it is running an in-place FFT, so it re-uses the same buffer for both input and output. So, at this point, I can't make heads or tails of the output. I understand the DFT concepts, such as the real portion being the amplitudes of the component cosine waves and the imaginary portion being the amplitudes of the component sine waves. I can also follow this diagram from the great book ""The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing"": So my specific questions are: From the output of the FFT, how do I find the ""most occurring frequencies""? This is part of my analysis of my accelerometer data. Should I read the real (cosine) or imaginary (sine) arrays? I have a 32-point input in the time domain. Shouldn't the output of the FFT be a 16-element array for reals and a 16-element array for imaginary? Why does the program give me real and imaginary array outputs both of size 32? Related to the previous question, how do I parse the indexes in the output arrays? Given my input of 32 samples sampled at 32 Hz, my understanding is that a 16-element array output should have its index uniformly spread up to 1/2 the sampling rate (of 32 Hz), so am I correct in understanding that each element of the array represents (32 Hz * 1/2) / 16 = 1 Hz? Why does the FFT output have negative values? I thought the values represent amplitudes of a sinusoid. For example, the output of Real[ 3 ] = -1.075 should mean an amplitude of -1.075 for a cosine wave of frequency 3. Is that right? How can an amplitude be negative?",['Before: \n\nRe: [0.887  1.645  2.005  1.069  1.069  0.69  1.046  1.847  0.808  0.617  0.792  1.384  1.782  0.925  0.751  0.858  0.915  1.006  0.985  0.97  1.075  1.183  1.408  1.575  1.556  1.282  1.06  1.061  1.283  1.701  1.101  0.702  ]\n\nIm: [0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  ]\n\nAfter: \n\nRe: [37.054  1.774  -1.075  1.451  -0.653  -0.253  -1.686  -3.602  0.226  0.374  -0.194  -0.312  -1.432  0.429  0.709  -0.085  0.0090  -0.085  0.709  0.429  -1.432  -0.312  -0.194  0.374  0.226  -3.602  -1.686  -0.253  -0.653  1.451  -1.075  1.774  ]\n\nIm: [0.0  1.474  -0.238  -2.026  -0.22  -0.24  -5.009  -1.398  0.416  -1.251  -0.708  -0.713  0.851  1.882  0.379  0.021  0.0  -0.021  -0.379  -1.882  -0.851  0.713  0.708  1.251  -0.416  1.398  5.009  0.24  0.22  2.026  0.238  -1.474  ]\n'],False

5256231,Can't serve HTML5 video through PHP on Safari/Mac (5.0),"I'm encountering a strange bug in Safari where, when I serve MP4 video through PHP (to obfuscate the file beneath the document root with a token-based authentication system), Safari for some reason fires the onerror event, and the video never loads (I can't get any useful information out of the event object sent to onerror — everything is undefined). When I access the PHP script directly (i.e., the video is not embedded in a page), the video controls appear momentarily before flashing to a QuickTime question mark. When I access the MP4 file directly, it works as expected. What's bizarre is that the embedded video works perfectly in the latest version of Chrome for Mac. Here are the headers when accessed through PHP: And here are the headers when test.mp4 is accessed directly: The only differing headers are: Accept-Ranges (which I don't think is necessary), Etag, Last-Modified, Content-Disposition, and X-Powered-By. Not only can Chrome handle the PHP-served video fine, but when I use the same script to load the MP4 through a Flash player, it also works fine. I just can't figure out what Safari is choking on. EDIT: Also, when I change the content disposition to ""attachment"", Safari will download the MP4 file just fine.","[""&lt;video&gt;'s"", 'Connection:Keep-Alive\nContent-Disposition:inline; filename=""test.mp4""\nContent-Length:5558749\nContent-Type:video/mp4\nDate:Tue, 22 Jun 2010 01:24:25 GMT\nKeep-Alive:timeout=10, max=29\nServer:Apache/2.2.15 (CentOS) mod_ssl/2.2.15 0.9.8l DAV/2 mod_auth_passthrough/2.1 FrontPage/5.0.2.2635\nX-Powered-By:PHP/5.2.13\n', 'Accept-Ranges:bytes\nConnection:Keep-Alive\nContent-Length:5558749\nContent-Type:video/mp4\nDate:Tue, 22 Jun 2010 01:26:45 GMT\nEtag:""1c04757-54d1dd-489944c5a6400""\nKeep-Alive:timeout=10, max=30\nLast-Modified:Tue, 22 Jun 2010 01:25:36 GMT\nServer:Apache/2.2.15 (CentOS) mod_ssl/2.2.15 0.9.8l DAV/2 mod_auth_passthrough/2.1 FrontPage/5.0.2.2635\n']",False
5276102,how to create english language dictionary application with python (django)?,I would like to create an online dictionary application by using python (or with django). It will be similar to http://dictionary.reference.com/. PS: the dictionary is not stored in a database. it's stored in a text file or gunzip file. Free english dictionary files can be downloaded from this URL: dicts.info/dictionaries.php. The easiest free dictionary file will be in the format of: There are some other formats as well. but all are stored in either text file or text.gz file My question is (1) Are there any existing open source python package or modules or application which implements this functionality that I can use or study from? (2) If the answer to the first question is NO. which algorithm should I follow to create such web application? Can I simply use the python built-in dictionary object for this job? so that the dictionary object's key will be the english word and the value will be the explanation. is this OK in term of performance? OR Do I have to create my own Tree Object to speed up the search? or any existing package which handles this job properly?

5276821,check ldap access rights with python,"I am writing a web frontend (django) for an LDAP server. There are different kinds of people with different kinds of privileges, so I set up LDAP ACL to control who gets to see or edit a specific attribute. Now its easy to determine if a specific user has read access - try to read, and you will see what you get. But I don't see an elegant way to distinguish between read and write access before I actually try to write some changes. That is, I would like to make it clear in the interface, if the logged in user has write access, or can only read. So that users won't try to edit an attribute which they can not. The only thing that came to my mind was to try to temporarily write some sort of dummy into an attribute, and see if that was successful. If so, the original value would be restored, and I know that this user has write access. I can then display this attribute as editable. The problem with this is that if the server crashes after the dummy has been written and before the original value has been restored, I am left with dummy values in my LDAP server.

I have some XML that looks something like the following: Now I have an XSLT transform that I'm applying to this XML. The XSLT is similar to the following: The output I get is basically what I want and looks like the following: But what I don't want are the xmlns="""" attributes in the &lt;messageHeader&gt; and &lt;messageBody&gt; elements. Now I've found that if I explicitly specify the namespace in the XSLT for those elements, then the unwanted attribute gets pushed down one level to the children of those attributes. I could just go through my entire XSLT and explicitly add the xmlns=""""http://www.companyname.com/schemas/product/Version001"" attribute to each of my xsl:element definitions, but I know that there must be a more elegant way. We programmers are far too lazy to not have a shortcut for this kind of nonsense. If my XSLT didn't consist of something as simple as the shortened example, I be tempted to do it that way. But I know there must be a better way. Does anyone know what I'm missing here?

5322217,Parsing XML into SQLite Database in Android,"This is my first Android project. I am supposed to parse an rss feed from the internet and put it into a SQLite database for offline access to the feed's posts. I have followed the xml parsing tutorial by Coding Green Robots and I have followed a SQLite database tutorial on the Code Project, but in trying to put those together, I have run into problems. The app builds on my Droid, but then it stops unexpectedly during this method in MainActivity: I retained the functionality from the original tutorial. All I changed was adding . dbh is a DatabaseHelper object declared in MainActivity. Each of those ArrayLists are declared in MainActivity, but they are also declared in the method. When I debug it and it gets to ThreadPoolExecutor.class runs and says ""Source not found. The JAR file /Users/Zach/Desktop/android-sdj-mac_x86/platforms/android-7/android.jar has no source attachment. You can attach the source by clicking Attach Source below."" My main question is what am I doing wrong here? I don't get any errors from this, and I don't understand what it means by source attachment. I feel that there is a reason the ArrayLists are declared in the method as well as MainActivity, and that I should be doing the same for dbh, but I am not sure why. Regardless, making a databaseHelper in the method wouldn't work in the long run, as the application will need to bring in new posts from the feed, and setting the old database to the new one with only the new posts would not work.

When VC++ 2010 converted the project, it must have changed the symbols to something that fools wxWidgets. If so, the bug could be in either place, either wxWidgets is making invalid assumptions about pre-processor definitions, or the VC++ 2010 conversion messed them up. The command lines for compiling the lone .cpp file in the project differ more than I would expect them to. 2008 command line /Od /I "".....\lib\vc_lib\mswud"" /I "".....\include"" /I ""."" /I "".....\samples"" /D ""WIN32"" /D ""_DEBUG"" /D ""_CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE=1"" /D ""_CRT_NON_CONFORMING_SWPRINTFS=1"" /D ""_SCL_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS=1"" /D ""WXMSW"" /D ""_UNICODE"" /D ""_WINDOWS"" /D ""NOPCH"" /D ""UNICODE"" /FD /EHsc /RTC1 /MDd /Fo""vc_mswud\minimal\"" /Fd""vc_mswud\minimal.pdb"" /W4 /nologo /c /Zi /TP /errorReport:prompt /MP 2010 command line /I"".....\lib\vc_lib\mswud"" /I"".....\include"" /I""."" /I"".....\samples"" /Zi /nologo /W4 /WX- /Od /Oy- /D ""WIN32"" /D ""_DEBUG"" /D ""_CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE=1"" /D ""_CRT_NON_CONFORMING_SWPRINTFS=1"" /D ""_SCL_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS=1"" /D ""WXMSW"" /D ""_UNICODE"" /D ""_WINDOWS"" /D ""NOPCH"" /Gm- /EHsc /RTC1 /MDd /GS /fp:precise /Zc:wchar_t /Zc:forScope /GR /Fp""vc_mswud\minimal\minimal.pch"" /Fa""vc_mswud\minimal\"" /Fo""vc_mswud\minimal\"" /Fd""vc_mswud\minimal.pdb"" /Gd /analyze- /errorReport:queue Example 2010 warning and error","['1&gt;wxbase29ud.lib(ipcbase.obj) : warning LNK4049: locally defined symbol ??1?$basic_string@_WU?$char_traits@_W@std@@V?$allocator@_W@2@@std@@QAE@XZ (public: __thiscall std::basic_string&lt;wchar_t,struct std::char_traits&lt;wchar_t&gt;,class std::allocator&lt;wchar_t&gt; &gt;::~basic_string&lt;wchar_t,struct std::char_traits&lt;wchar_t&gt;,class std::allocator&lt;wchar_t&gt; &gt;(void)) imported\n\n1&gt;wxbase29ud.lib(mimecmn.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol ""__declspec(dllimport) public: class std::basic_string&lt;wchar_t,struct std::char_traits&lt;wchar_t&gt;,class std::allocator&lt;wchar_t&gt; &gt; &amp; __thiscall std::basic_string&lt;wchar_t,struct std::char_traits&lt;wchar_t&gt;,class std::allocator&lt;wchar_t&gt; &gt;::assign(class std::_String_const_iterator&lt;wchar_t,struct std::char_traits&lt;wchar_t&gt;,class std::allocator&lt;wchar_t&gt; &gt;,class std::_String_const_iterator&lt;wchar_t,struct std::char_traits&lt;wchar_t&gt;,class std::allocator&lt;wchar_t&gt; &gt;)"" (__imp_?assign@?$basic_string@_WU?$char_traits@_W@std@@V?$allocator@_W@2@@std@@QAEAAV12@V?$_String_const_iterator@_WU?$char_traits@_W@std@@V?$allocator@_W@2@@2@0@Z)\n']",False

Since it's an external hdd at night I unplugged it and when I plugged it back in ubuntu didn't detect the already mounted hdd :( This is what I did to mount the hdd: This worked great.

Every time I do: I get: What can I do to make ubuntu server associate automatically the directory with the hdd?

5561923,How to change an image's ImageUrl attribute on page load with asp.net and C# in IE,"I have links on a homepage that may or may not have attachments associated with them. If the links have attachments, then an icon will be placed next to the link. The icon will only be there if the link has an attachment. The foreach loop is going through each of the ""Current Event"" pictures on the homepage then getting the type of attachment associated with each link aka the AtachmentID. The AttachmentID can be a 0, 1, 2, or 3 which means no attachment, photo attached, video attached, or document attached repectively. A switch statement is then used to change the ImageUrl attribute to the corresponding picture. The image does not load in IE, however it does work for firefox. The following is the aspx front","['protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)\n    {\n        foreach (Image pic in imgAttachment)\n            {\n                 int type = ds.Current_Events[index].AttachmentID;\n                 //ds is the dataset\n', '                 switch (type)\n                     {\n                            case 0:\n                                break;\n                            case 1:\n                                pic.ImageUrl = ""images/eventicons/Photo.jpg"";\n                                //changed from just ""Photo.jpg""\n                                break;\n                            case 2:\n                                pic.ImageUrl = ""images/eventicons/Video.jpg"";\n                                //changed from just ""Video.jpg""\n                                break;\n                            case 3:\n                                pic.ImageUrl = ""images/eventicons/Doc.jpg"";\n                                //changed from just ""Doc.jpg""\n                                break;\n                            default:\n                                pic.Visible = false;\n                                break;\n                      }\n                  index++;\n            }\n    }\n', '&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;ul&gt;\n   &lt;li&gt;\n      &lt;asp:HyperLink ID=""lblEvent1"" runat=""server""&gt;              \n           &lt;img src=""images/bar_blank.gif"" /&gt;\n      &lt;/asp:HyperLink&gt;\n      &lt;asp:Image ID=""Image1"" runat=""server"" /&gt;\n   &lt;/li&gt;\n   &lt;li&gt;\n      &lt;asp:HyperLink ID=""lblEvent2"" runat=""server""&gt;\n           &lt;img src=""images/bar_blank.gif"" /&gt;\n      &lt;/asp:HyperLink&gt;\n      &lt;asp:Image ID=""Image2"" runat=""server"" /&gt;\n   &lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n']",False

5691503,Generic factories impossible when requiring dependency injection?,"I am trying to make some generic factories for my service factories and dao factories and am running into some limitations. Typically my service and dao factories look like this: Then I tried doing a generic factories: So they could used like this: Here are the problems I am running into: Can't use static class as type constraint for generics, which I was trying to use for the EntityServiceFactory, because without it I don't know how to inject the appropriate dao. Can't have the factories derive from the Generic factories because I get an error like: Static class 'Persons.PersonDaoFactory' cannot derive from type 'Entities.EntityDaoFactory'. Static classes must derive from object. Tried making them all non-static classes with private constructors to get around that but then I get: 'Persons.PersonService' must be a non-abstract type with a public parameterless constructor in order to use it as parameter 'serviceClass' in the generic type or method 'Entities.EntityServiceFactory I was able to read why number 3 occurs on here, but that still doesn't solve my problems. I got the DaoFactory working, but it only works if the specific DaoClass doesn't need any dependency injection, otherwise error 3 pops up again. Is there anyway to get these generic factories working using a different approach while still being able to use DI? EDIT ---- I was able to get this sort of working, but it has some oddities. First I created a IEntityFactory interface: Then changed the EntityDaoFactory to: So I could pass in the appropriate type parameters and change the EntityServiceFactory to: So for a specific implementation such as with the Person object the calls look like: So it's working now, but the oddities are: You can instantiate a factory, which was required (as far as I know the only way to do it?) for the EntityServiceFactory, but for someone using my API there would be no reason for them to do it but they still could. Services and DAOs which have dependency requirements can now be instantiated with no parameters, which would break the instantiated class methods (but I had to do it to be able to use it as a type parameter). They shouldn't even ever by instantiating these objects anyway but they can now and do so incorrectly. Also a final problem I just thought of is this solution doesn't really handle a variable amount of dependencies well. Still wonder if there is a better approach for this? Conclusion: I think in the end even though it works, I gave up a lot of order to have that generic factory, which isn't that flexible and not giving me much, so I probably wouldn't use it in this case due to the limitations.","['public static class PersonServiceFactory\n{\n    private static PersonService personService;\n\n    public static PersonService GetInstance()\n    {\n        if (personService == null)\n        {\n            PersonDao personDao = PersonDaoFactory.GetInstance();\n            personService = new PersonService(personDao);\n\n        }\n\n        return personService;\n    }\n}\n\npublic static class PersonDaoFactory\n{\n    private static PersonDao personDao;\n\n    internal static PersonDao GetInstance()\n    {\n        if (personDao == null)\n        {\n            personDao = new PersonDao();\n\n        }\n\n        return personDao;\n    }\n}\n', ' public abstract class EntityDaoFactory&lt;daoClass&gt;\n        where daoClass : class, new()\n    {\n        private static daoClass factorySupportClass;\n\n        internal static daoClass GetInstance()\n        {\n            if (factorySupportClass == null)\n            {\n                factorySupportClass = new daoClass();\n\n            }\n\n            return factorySupportClass;\n        }\n    }\n\n  public abstract class EntityServiceFactory&lt;serviceClass, daoClass&gt;\n        where serviceClass : class, new()\n        where daoClass : class\n    {\n        private static serviceClass factorySupportClass;\n\n        internal static serviceClass GetInstance()\n        {\n            if (factorySupportClass == null)\n            {\n                //daoClass daoSupportClass = *how to get daoSupportClassfactory.GetInstance(); here?*\n                factorySupportClass = new serviceClass(daoSupportClass);\n\n            }\n\n            return factorySupportClass;\n        }\n    }\n', 'public static class PersonDaoFactory : Entities.EntityDaoFactory&lt;PersonDao&gt;\n{\n}\n\npublic static class PersonServiceFactory : Entities.EntityServiceFactory&lt;PersonService, PersonDaoFactory&gt;\n{\n}\n', ' public interface IEntityFactory&lt;T&gt;\n    where T : class\n{\n    T GetInstance();\n}\n', 'public abstract class EntityDaoFactory&lt;daoClass&gt; : IEntityFactory&lt;daoClass&gt;\n        where daoClass : class, new()\n    {\n        private static daoClass factorySupportClass;\n\n        public daoClass GetInstance()\n        {\n            if (factorySupportClass == null)\n            {\n                factorySupportClass = new daoClass();\n\n            }\n\n            return factorySupportClass;\n        }\n    }\n', ' public abstract class EntityServiceFactory&lt;serviceClass, daoClass, daoFactoryClass&gt;\n        where serviceClass : class, new()\n        where daoClass : class, new()\n        where daoFactoryClass : IEntityFactory&lt;daoClass&gt;, new()\n    {\n        private static serviceClass factorySupportClass;\n\n        public static serviceClass GetInstance()\n        {\n            if (factorySupportClass == null)\n            {\n                daoFactoryClass daoSupportFactory = new daoFactoryClass();\n                daoClass daoSupportClass = daoSupportFactory.GetInstance();\n                factorySupportClass = new serviceClass();\n\n            }\n\n            return factorySupportClass;\n        }\n    }\n', 'public class PersonDaoFactory : Entities.EntityDaoFactory&lt;PersonDao&gt;\n{\n}\n\n public class PersonServiceFactory : Entities.EntityServiceFactory&lt;PersonService, PersonDao, PersonDaoFactory&gt;\n{\n}\n']",False

I have also added the authorization part using linux file permissions so only authorized users can access the hdfs server, however, I am stuck at the authentication part. It seems hadoop does not provide any in built authentication and the users are identified only through unix 'whoami', meaning I cannot enable password for the specific user. ref: http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/r1.0.3/hdfs_permissions_guide.html So even if I create a new user and set permissions for it, there is no way to identify whether the user is authenticate or not. Two users with the same username and different password have the access to the all the resources intended for that username. I am wondering if there is any way to enable user authentication in hdfs (either intrinsic in any new hadoop release or using third party tool like kerbores etc.) Edit: Ok, I have checked and it seems that kerberos may be an option but I just want to know if there is any other alternative available for authentication.

I am working on a database with a quite complex business logic, with existing views, stored procedures and new ones to be designed. By means of comparisons of different queries or part of them, I have a strong feeling that there are sections performing the same job with a different arrangement, but of course to refactor the whole mess I need something more that a feeling; so I am trying to determine a way to demonstrate that two statements are equivalent. An obvious but weak response could be to ascertain that the two queries A and B produce the same recordset: if A is a subset of B and B is a subset of A, they are the same recordset; but I am not sure that this is a good idea because, of course, a recordset is not a query, the results could depend on data and specific parameter values. My questions is: there is a method to prove the equivalence of two different queries? I would say yes, because the optimization performed by the database should works on this. Someone could provide me some pointer to documentation or books digging in this? If there is no general method to prove the equivalence, there is some smart approach based on regression testing performed according to some effective heuristic that does the job? Edited later: in case, reverse engineering the queries (by hand?) by means of relational algebra, could be a superior method to assess the query equivalence instead of using other queries and / or the computer?

I used to using hibernate in EJB3 environment where it is a default behavior. The entity manager cache is clear for each new request. Isn't it a more safe behavior for guice-persist to clear the session for each request? Or at least to give it as a setting for JpaPersistModule?

5977229,Dynamic form with no real OOP or objects?,"I am tacking a large refactor of a project, and I had asked this question to confirm/understand the direction I should go in and I think I got the answer that I wanted, which is not to throw away years worth of code. So, now begins the challenge of refactoring the code. I've been reading Martine Fowler and Martin Feathers' books, and they have a lot of insight, but I am looking for advice on the ultimate goal of where I want the application to be. So to reiterate the application a little bit, its a dynamic forms system, with lots of validation logic and data logic between the fields. The main record that gets inserted is the set of form fields that is on the page. Another part of it is 'Actions' that you can do for a person. These 'Actions' can differ client by client, and there are hundreds of 'Actions'. There is also talk that we can somehow make an engine that can eventually take on other similar areas, where a 'person' can be something else (such as student, or employee). So I want to build something very de-coupled. We have one codebase, but different DBs for different clients. The set of form fields on the page are dynamic, but the DB is not - it is translated into the specific DB table via stored procs. So, the generic set of fields are sent to the stored proc and the stored proc then decides what to do with the fields (figure out which table it needs to go to). These tables in fact are pretty static, meaning that they are not really dynamic, and there is a certain structure to it. What I'm struggling specifically is how to setup a good way to do the dynamic form control page. It seems majority of the logic will be in code on the UI/aspx.cs page, because its loading controls onto the webpage. Is there some way I can do this, so it is done in a streamlined fashion, so the aspx.cs page isn't 5000 lines long? I have a 'FORM' object, and one of the properties is its' 'FIELDS'. So this object is loaded up in the business layer and the Data layer, but now on the fron end, it has to loop through the FIELDS and output the controls onto the page. Also, someway to be able to control the placement would be useful, too - not sure how do get that into this model.... Also, from another point of view - how can I 'really' get this into an object-oriented-structure? Because technically, they can create forms of anything. And those form fields can represent any object. So, for example, today they can create a set of form fields, that represent a 'person' - tomorrow they can create a set of form fields that represent a 'furniture'. How can I possibly translate this to to a person or a furniture object (or should I even be trying to?). And I don't really have controls over the form fields, because they can create whatever.... Any thought process would be really helpful - thanks!",[],False
