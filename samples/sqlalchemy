15936,Get value error with libxml2 sax parser,"I'm trying to parse a xml file with libxml2's sax interface. Sometimes it works great, but then i change 2 lines order in the xml (it remains valid of coure) and some value become invalid after parse. I'm using startElementNsSAX2Func for startElement, it has an argument const xmlChar ** attributes which stores the attributes of the current element. At the beginning of my startElement method, i create a simple object to handle attributes Here is the code of the class: (xmlChar is Typedef unsigned char xmlChar) Then if i need to store the value of an attribute, i clone it with this staic method (I also tried to use libxml2's xmlStrdup, the result is the same): It works in 99%, but sometimes the result at the end contains nothing similar to the source. Here is an example output (the input is abcdef, and \0 terminated): I call it this way: So while the address of the source didn't changed, it's value did. The parsing of the xml file continues without any problem, the next values after cloneing become valid again. The error is always at the same element and argument, if the xml file didn't changed. If i change something little in the xml, for example: to the error appears somewhere else, or it's disappear and the parseing works fine. What could cause this?

102375,How do I figure out the type of the SQL Server 2008 R2 View definition,"I was walking view definitions in a database today using sqlalchemy 0.6 (using get_view_definition()) and I ran across one that was larger than 4000 characters. MS seems to say (Information Schema Views for VIEWs) that shouldn't be returned. MS SQL Server Management Studio shows the whole thing (well at least the beginning and the end look right) if you ask for the design of the view. sqlalchemy returns a string truncated at 4000 characters (boo, hiss). How can I ask the database what type it wants to return for this piece of data instead of depending on what I suspect is out of date documentation. I'm assuming the type is probably varchar. I would just like to verify that.",[],True

108441,Why is this code slowing down?,"I'm currently in the process of converting a number of Access databases to Xml files. I have done this before and I still have the code from a previous project. However, this code will not let me structure the xml as I please which is what I need to do this time around. I'm using with -loops to achieve this but it gets incredibly slow after a couple of 1000 rows of data. Reading in on how XDocument works tells me that actually copies the entire xml-code and adds the new element as it pastes everything back into the file. If this is true then that's probably where the problem lies. This is the part that reads and writes the data from Access to Xml, take a look and see if there's any way of saving it. Converting a database with 27 columns and 12 256 rows takes almost 30 minutes while a smaller one with a mere 500 rows takes roughly 5 seconds. This is this code from my old converter. This code is pretty unaffected by the size of the database, the 12 556 database only takes a second to convert. Could there possably be a way to merge these two? EDIT: Just to clarify, the application slows down as it's executed. As in the first 500 takes 5 seconds no matter how big the database is. UPDATE: Okay so I've come back after the weekend now and I made a small adjustment in the code to seperate the reading and the writing by filling a jagged array with the values in one loop and writing them in another. This has proven my theory wrong and it's infact the reading that takes so much time. Any ideas on how to fill an array with the values without hitting the database inside the loop? UPDATE2: This is the end result after switching to a -loop and collecting all the data right away.","['XDocument', 'for', 'XElement.Add', 'private void ReadWrite(string file)\n{\n    using (_Connection = new OleDbConnection(string.Format(""Provider=Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0;Mode=12;Data Source={0}"", pathAccess)))\n    {\n        _Connection.Open();\n        //Gives me values from the AccessDB: tableName, columnName, colCount, rowCount and listOfTimeStamps.\n        GetValues(pathAccess);\n\n        XDocument doc = new XDocument(new XDeclaration(""1.0"", ""utf-8"", ""true""), new XElement(tableName));\n        for (int rowInt = 0; rowInt &lt; rowCount; rowInt++)\n        {\n            XElement item = new XElement(""Item"", new XAttribute(""Time"", listOfTimestamps[rowInt].ToString().Replace("" "", ""_"")));\n            doc.Root.Add(item);\n\n            //colCount""-1"" prevents the timestamp from beeing written again.\n            for (int colInt = 0; colInt &lt; colCount - 1; colInt++)\n            {\n                using (OleDbCommand cmnd = new OleDbCommand(string.Format(""SELECT {0} FROM {1} Where TimeStamp = #{2}#"", columnName[colInt] , tableName, listOfTimestamps[rowInt]), _Connection))\n                {\n                    XElement value = new XElement(columnName[colInt], cmnd.ExecuteScalar().ToString());\n                    item.Add(value);\n                }\n            }\n            //Updates progressbar\n            backgroundWorker1.ReportProgress(rowInt);\n        }\n        backgroundWorker1.ReportProgress(0);\n        doc.Save(file);\n    }\n}\n', 'public void ReadWrite2(string file)\n{\n    DataSet dataSet = new DataSet();\n    using (_Connection = new OleDbConnection(string.Format(""Provider=Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0;Mode=12;Data Source={0}"", file)))\n    {\n        _Connection.Open();\n\n        DataTable schemaTable = _Connection.GetOleDbSchemaTable(OleDbSchemaGuid.Tables, new object[] { null, null, null, ""TABLE"" });\n\n        foreach (DataRow dataTableRow in schemaTable.Rows)\n        {\n            string tableName = dataTableRow[""Table_Name""].ToString();\n\n            DataTable dataTable = dataSet.Tables.Add(tableName);\n            using (OleDbCommand readRows = new OleDbCommand(""SELECT * from "" + tableName, _Connection))\n            {\n                OleDbDataAdapter adapter = new OleDbDataAdapter(readRows);\n                adapter.Fill(dataTable);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    dataSet.WriteXml(file.Replace("".mdb"", "".xml""));\n}\n', 'DataReader.Read()', 'public void ReadWrite3(string Save, string Load)\n    {\n        using (_Connection = new OleDbConnection(string.Format(""Provider=Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0;Mode=12;Data Source={0}"", Load)))\n        {\n            _Connection.Open();\n            GetValues(_Connection);\n\n            _Command = new OleDbCommand(String.Format(""SELECT {0} FROM {1}"", strColumns, tables), _Connection);\n            XDocument doc = new XDocument(new XDeclaration(""1.0"", ""utf-8"", ""true""), new XElement(""plmslog"", new XAttribute(""machineid"", root)));\n            using (_DataReader = _Command.ExecuteReader())\n            {\n                for (int rowInt = 0; _DataReader.Read(); rowInt++ )\n                {\n                    for (int logInt = 0; logInt &lt; colCount; logInt++)\n                    {\n\n                        XElement log = new XElement(""log"");\n                        doc.Root.Add(log);\n\n                        elementValues = updateElementValues(rowInt, logInt);\n\n                        for (int valInt = 0; valInt &lt; elements.Length; valInt++)\n                        {\n                            XElement value = new XElement(elements[valInt], elementValues[valInt]);\n                            log.Add(value);\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            doc.Save(Save);\n        }\n    }\n']",False

I understand why ordinary Brownian motion $X(t)$ is the ordinary integral of white noise $W(s)$, as follows: $$ X(t) = \int_0^t dW(s) $$ On the other hand FBM (Levy's version) is given as $$ X(t) = \int_0^t (t - s)^{H - \frac{1}{2}}dW(s) $$ What I'd like to know is the reason for the factor $ (t - s)^{H - \frac{1}{2}}$.

Backgrounds: The usage of these bit columns are left to be defined by the end user, along with a few of other int, float, double, varchar columns, so as to make the table a little more extensible. I'm also not going to use one-to-many custom property table in practice. Add an integer column is cheap, but if the underlying database could store several bit columns in one int32 field, I don't have to explicit merge them myself.",[],False

I am working on the correct file: When I change something else in the file or hard-code some HTML text in it, it shows up on the page.

374315,How can I display additional boot and shutdown information on the Windows 7 welcome screen?,"There is a small tweak, I believe it is a registry key, that allows to display additional information on the Welcome and Shutting down screens of Windows 7 (and most likely Vista, too). I have activated this tweak on one of my systems; unfortunately I forgot how I did it, and I can't seem to find the website that originally gave me that information. Usually, the Windows 7 welcome screen will just display ""Welcome"" when logging in. With the tweak activated, my Welcome screen gives status information such as ""Loading user settings"" or ""Preparing desktop"". When shutting down, the default screen simply says ""Shutting down"". With the tweak activated, it gives additional status information such as ""Stopping Windows services"". This appears the same way that Windows gives information when updates are installed or configured during the startup or shutdown procedure, and I find them quite helpful in getting a feel for what task takes how long during that process. The only setting I was able to find is the Boot log checkbox on the Boot tab of the msconfig application. However, this results in Windows displaying console logs of drivers it is loading, etc., instead of the animated Windows title. This is NOT the setting I am looking for. The ""additional boot information"" setting that I have activated on this system still displays the regular animated Windows logo, and only replaces the strings displayed on the blue Welcome and Shutdown screens. Could someone direct me to the registry key (or whatever setting) that is used to get this behaviour? Edit: Here are a few pictures of the enhanced Welcome and Shutdown screens taken with my mobile phone—they're in German though.

374550,Integrating Excel and Access with Sharpoint,"My problem deals with Excel, Sharepoint, and Access all in one. I will try to detail it as best as I can. To start, I have an Access Database containing some forms and 3 tables. These 3 tables are linked to 3 Excel spreadsheets. The main purpose of this database is to act as a search form that takes user input and searches through the 3 linked tables and display the results. What I want to do is put this Database onto SharePoint so that everyone on my team can use it for various searches. In order for information to stay current, I have the 3 excel spreadsheets on SharePoint for people to check out, update, and then check back in – (now you see the reason for linking the spreadsheets and tables, I want the updated information to be immediately displayed in the Database). Here is where I run into the following 2 problems: 1) I cannot link an excel spreadsheet to an access database on SharePoint. The error message I receive basically states that the data needs to be in XML format in order to be linked. a. I have tried converting the spreadsheets to XML but still cannot get the tables to link for reasons unknown to me. 2) The way my ‘search database’ works is a user inputs information, the database creates a new form (I used VB to make all this happen), and displays the results. My problem is that I cannot get the database to open in edit mode only from a document library. Every time I attempt to open the DB from the document library, a message pops up asking whether I want ‘read only’ or ‘edit mode.’ Ideally, I would like no message to pop up and just have the database do what it is supposed to do. It seems to me that this should be relatively simple to fix but I just can’t figure it out. Logically, it makes sense to me that I could have the Access Database and the linked excel tables all in the same sharepoint folder and it should work no problem. I have spent quite some time researching how to fix this problem but have not come up with any solution. Hopefully someone out there will be able to help :) Thanks :-)",[],False

414411,WiFi Problems - Works Intermittently (Browser will wait for 30-60 seconds),"I have a simple network setup. A DSL connection from AT&amp;T connected to a Belkin Play Wireless Router. Two computers are connected through ethernet and have no problems whatsoever. Any device that connects wirelessly (laptops, desktops, iPhone, iPad, etc.) will connect without a problem (default WPA/WPA2 security settings). However, when browsing/etc (antyhing that uses internet access) it will often act like it is waiting for a response (for about 30-60 seconds) and then either suddenly start receiving or stop (saying it wasn't able to load the page). As an example, on an iPhone using Safari, after clicking on a link it will act like it is loading but the progress bar does not fill. After the above period of time it will either 1) start loading the page 2) display the message ""Safari could not load the website"" and then immediately start loading the page or 3) display the previous message and not do anything else. Signal strength doesn't seem to be an issue as this happens even with a full signal bar. Have tried both networks (the regular 2.4Ghz and the 5GHz) and they both have the same problem. Any suggestions as what this could be caused by? It's a difficult problem to describe so I have not found any possible reasons/solutions. I've had similar issues in the past with different routers (a previous Linksys router would drop the wireless connection every few minutes) that were resolved by getting a different router. The fact that a different router has a similar yet different problem might suggest an interference problem but then it shouldn't be an issue on the different frequency (5GHz) unless there is a lot of interference.",[],False

437607,"How does ""first"" property in ace:datatable work?","We're trying to put 3 tables in the same page with some kind of synchronized pagination. Because of the ""paginator"" property in ace:datatable is individual for each table, we're using some commandLinks to implement the functionality of moving forward and backward. We've tried with de ""page"" property in the tables, linked all of them to a property in the backing-bean that is incremented or decremented with the commandLink's action method. But this ""page"" property only works when ""paginator"" property is set to true. And because we don't want to show paginator itself (with numbered pages, an buttons and everything else), we can't use this property. We've tried too with the ""first"" property of the ace:datatable, and again binding this property to the backing-bean. But it doesn't do anything: when we change this property's value, the tables remain in the same position of the list that populates them. We're populating the table with a personalized ArrayList (where is a class that matches a table in the database). And only got the thing work when enabling paginator in the tables and used ""page"" property. And we've used a Datamodel object too, but with no positive results. So, what does ""first"" property of ace:datatable serving for? (Please, don't tell me the API definition of this property, I've read it many times ;) ).

Update: I've received response through the IceSoft forum. nils.lundquist says: The cause of this issue appears to have been some legacy pagination code in the library that the ace:dataTable was forked from. It isn't recognizable as part of our features, so I've corrected the issue and, assuming testing goes well, the fix will appear in our coming release (beta also). Note that first still won't have an effect when component controlled pagination is enabled, and I've adjusted the TLD to reflect this. First will now actually work when pagination is disabled. Referring to iceFaces 3.1.0 beta02, releasing this week. If anyone knows a better way to solve this case (3 dataTables with pagination linked) any help will be apreciated. TIA.",[],False

A ListBox takes values from a list in the 'business object' displaying the Name property and providing the Value property.

My real issue becomes when I wish to call a function within the array utilizing a loop: The classes involved with T and CT respectively both have the beingShot method, which is public. Eclipse advises casting them as a quick fix.

490894,Is it possible to make Nose only run tests which are sub-classes of TestCase or TestSuite (like unittest.main()),"My test framework is currently based on a test-runner utility which itself is derived from the Eclipse pydev python test-runner. I'm switching to use Nose, which has many of the features of my custom test-runner but seems to be better quality code. My test suite includes a number of abstract test-classes which previously never ran. The standard python testrunner (and my custom one) only ran instances of unittest.TestCase and unittest.TestSuite. I've noticed that since I switched to Nose it's running just about anything which starts withthe name ""test"" which is annoying... because the naming convention we used for the test-mixins also looks like a test class to Nose. Previously these never ran as tests because they were not instances of TestCase or TestSuite.

662322,"SQLAlchemy - Mapping a Class against Multiple Tables, one of which is read only","I have a foobar concept which is represented by the 'foobar' and 'foobar_data_cache' tables is the database and with the 'Foobar' class is python. The 'foobar' table represents some data about the concept and the 'foobar_data_cache' table represents some other data about the concept, data that derived from many other information in the database and that are computed by a database trigger. To keep consistency, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE privileges are revoked from 'foobar_data_cache' table. With SQLAlchemy I want to map the 'Foobar' class to the two tables 'foobar' and 'foobar_data_cache' with a join. There is no reason to use another class to represent the data from 'foobar_data_cache' table and to build a relationship between those two classes because the data from both tables are strongly related. Indeed, from the database point of view, there is a one-to-one relationship between the two tables, guaranteed by: - the primary key of 'foobar_data_cache' beeing also a foreign key referencing the primary key of 'foobar' - and a trigger that checks that each row in 'foobar' has a corresponding row in 'foobar_data_cache' My problem is that when I try to persist a new Foobar object with SQLAlchemy ORM, it tries to insert some row for 'foobar_data_cache' table, which I would like to prevent. So, is it this possible to configure SQLAlchemy in a way that would consider 'foobar_data_cache' table as read-only? And if yes, how? Here is the code to explain my problem: Here is the SQL commands to create the two tables: Note: Some people might wonder why I split my data in two different tables considering the fact that it is a one-to-one relationship between them. The problem would be easily solve by using a single table and the FetchedValue construct (see How to persist only a subset of the mapped columns on SQLAlchemy?) on computed columns. Well, it is a bit complex but i will try to explain. First, the other things not explained above are: - I use PostgreSQL 8.4 which, among other things, cannot have deferrable UNIQUE constraints - none of my columns accept a NULL value - some columns in 'foobar_data_cache' have a unique constraint (not deferrable) - the trigger that computes the data in 'foobar_data_cache' is deferred until the end of the transaction. Indeed, it is because it takes information from others tables that can only be inserted after the insert on 'foobar', due to foreign key constraints. That said, in the case of using a single table, that means I would have to use a temporary dummy value for my computed columns because of the NOT-NULL constraints. My trigger would finally override it at the end of the transaction. And the problem is about concurency. Indeed, new transactions Tx trying to insert new 'foobar' while another transaction T1 is performing, would fail because the default dummy values for the unique columns already exists in the row corresponding to the performing transaction T1. I could generate random dummy values for columns having unique constraints but I don't like that style of doing things.","[""from sqlalchemy import (\n    Table,\n    Column,\n    Integer,\n    String,\n    ForeignKeyConstraint,\n    join,\n    create_engine,\n    )\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import (\n    column_property,\n    sessionmaker,\n    )\nfrom sqlalchemy.schema import (\n    FetchedValue,\n    )\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\n\nBase = declarative_base()\n\n_foobar_table = Table('foobar', Base.metadata,\n        Column('id', Integer, primary_key=True),\n        Column('some_data', String),\n    )\n\n_foobar_data_cache_table = Table('foobar_data_cache', Base.metadata,\n        Column('foobar_id', Integer, primary_key=True),\n        Column('computed_data', String, server_default=FetchedValue()),\n        ForeignKeyConstraint(['foobar_id'], ['foobar.id']),\n    )\n\nclass Foobar(Base):\n    __table__ = _foobar_table.join(_foobar_data_cache_table)\n    _id = column_property(_foobar_table.c.id, _foobar_data_cache_table.c.foobar_id)\n\n    def __init__(self, some_data):\n        self.some_data = some_data\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    engine = create_engine('postgresql://tester@localhost:5432/mytestdb')\n    Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)\n    session = Session()\n\n    my_foobar = Foobar('Dummy data')\n    session.add(my_foobar)\n    session.commit()\n"", 'CREATE TABLE foobar (\n  id int NOT NULL DEFAULT -2147483648,\n  some_data varchar NOT NULL,\n  CONSTRAINT pk_foobar PRIMARY KEY (id)\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE foobar_data_cache (\n  foobar_id int NOT NULL,\n  computed_data varchar NOT NULL,\n  CONSTRAINT pk_foobar_data_cache PRIMARY KEY (foobar_id),\n  CONSTRAINT fk_foobar_data_cache_foobar_1 FOREIGN KEY (foobar_id)\n    REFERENCES foobar (id) MATCH FULL\n    ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE CASCADE\n);  \n']",True

861370,Scanning a billion rows in an ultra-fast database,"Background A local database contains nearly 1.3 billion unique rows. Each row is indirectly associated with a specific latitude and longitude (location). Each row has a date stamp. Use Case The problem is as follows: The user sets a starting/ending date, and a range of values (e.g., 100 to 105). The system gathers all the rows that match the given date, grouped by location. The system performs determines the locations that, during those dates, have a statistical likelihood of falling into the given range of values. The system displays all matching locations to the user. This is a problem of speed and scale. Question What is the least expensive solution architecture you can imagine that would allow such a system to retrieve results for users in under five seconds? Current System The environment is currently: PostgreSQL 8.4 (upgrade is possible; switching databases is not an option) R and PL/R XFS WD VelociRaptor 8 GB RAM (Corsair G.Skill; 1.3 GHz) Quad core GenuineIntel 7 (2.8 GHz) Ubuntu 10.10 Hardware upgrades are acceptable. Update - Database Structure The billions of rows are in a table resembling: id - Primary key taken - Date assigned to the row location_id - Reference to the latitude/longitude category - A description of the data value1 .. 3 - The other values the user can query The column is typically consecutive dates per , sometimes each location has data from 1800 to 2010 (about 77,000 dates, many of them duplicated as each location has data in the same date range). There are seven categories and the tables are already split by category (using child tables). Each category contains ~190 million rows. In the near future, the number of rows per category will exceed a billion. There are approximately 20,000 locations and 70,000 cities. The locations are correlated to city by latitude and longitude. Assigning each location to a particular city means finding the city's boundaries, which is not a trivial task. Ideas Some ideas I have include: Find a cloud service to host the database. Create an SSD raid stripe (great video). Create a table that amalgamates all the locations by city (pre-calculation).

I am working with Entity Framework and things are slightly different to perhaps your own project. I consume the original object, modify it directly, create a clone of the modified item, revert the original item from store and save changes accordingly. An object is not reverted to original if never consumed by a calculation, in these instances, I save directly over that object along with the various relationships that exist with further objects. This may sound long winded, but I assure you - it seems the easiest so far in terms of my workings with EF in my situation. My trouble with these archiving routines is, that over time as I introduce further functionality - I sometimes, without knowing, break critical code to a point where I have to regression test the entire solution over, from beginning to end, to ensure that the archiving requirements remain intact. Is there any unit test approach or automated methodology for testing these sorts of requirements. It would speed up deployment of packages cutting down on my own manual testing. Any advice or links to simlar situations appreciated.",[],False

979338,JSON return data is always null from WebService (C#.NET),"I have stepped through my WebServices code to validate that I am actually returning data, but when I check the return on the JSON side, it always says ""null.""

984814,Why doesn't this order of code work properly?,"So I've been working on part of this program for a few hours straight. I have a few lines of code that have stumped me for over an hour now. It just doesn't make sense. I read the lines over and over again and think in my head what it should do, but it's not doing it! It's probably some stupid mistake that I keep overlooking (usually happens to me..) or it could be from lack of sleep/constantly working on it for the last few hours. The program is quite long, but the chunk of code I'm having issues with is only a few lines - so I'll only post the whole thing if needed. Ok, so here is a quick run down of what this should be doing: I have a single vector, filled with with manually set strings (19, each being 79 characters long). This 1 dimensional vector will be treated as a 2d vector - as i'm trying to keep it basic. So this vector of strings, if displayed 1 string per line, essentially creates a grid with rectangle sections of '.' and paths of '#' connecting the rectangle sections. It should get an x and y coordinate, passed to the function. It loops through like a 2d vector and finds the location. It checks to see if the char at the location is NOT '.' or '#' else, it changes the char to an X to mark its position. I set the testing up with a valid x,y coordinate that is the location of a '.' - The problem is right after the line where i cout ""match found::: "" When the program runs, it displays the value of vLevel[i][j] = '.' But for some reason, it doesn't go to the else statement where the function is called 4 more times and I put the cout statement. Heres what the grid looks like. The white spaces are spaces.. each line is a string in the vector: Heres the section of code I'm dealing with: The spacing got messed up when pasting it, so i tried to clean it up a bit. I don't get why it skips the else. Like I said, I'm sure I'll feel dumb once this is resolved. I need sleep lol. Let me know if you need more info.

991218,"In ASP.NET Web API, how can I make HTTP response syntax consistent if an exception is thrown?","I'm creating an HTTP API using ASP.NET Web API. I've noticed that if an exception occurs that I haven't handled, that behaviour is very different to if I deliberately throw an HttpResponseException. This will make it hard for clients to reliably handle an error and display the ""reason"" message. Eg consider this code: This creates a response which has the error in an HTTP header and the response code set to 500: Error: This request could not be processed. Attempted to divide by zero. The actual response body is empty. However if I remove the try/catch block, or if an exception occurs for which I do not manually throw an HttpResponseException, I get totally different behaviour. Although the status code is still 500, the header message just says ""Internal Server Error"" and the message is encoded in a JSON format like this: I think I prefer the latter as it gives you more info for debugging but it removes the ability to customise the message or provide a user-readable message for the problem. Why is WebAPI inconsistent with how it handles exceptions? Am I doing something myself to cause this inconsistency? It just seems rather messy and difficult to work with and may mean that the calling application will have to be coded to handle two different types of error response :(","['[HttpPost]\npublic void ThisWillThrowAnError()\n{\n    try\n    {\n        var i = 0;\n        var b = 1 / i; // cause divide by zero exception for testing\n    }\n    catch (Exception ex)\n    {\n        HttpResponseMessage message = new HttpResponseMessage();\n        message.ReasonPhrase = ""Error: "" + ex.Message;\n        throw new HttpResponseException(message);\n    }\n}\n', '{\n  ""Message"": ""An error has occurred."",\n  ""ExceptionMessage"": ""Attempted to divide by zero."",\n  ""ExceptionType"": ""System.DivideByZeroException"",\n  ""StackTrace"": "" at ProjectName.Controllers (etc....)""\n}\n']",False

If whilst uploading v2 there is an issue with the file upload I want to ensure v1 is still in place, and not some corrupt v2 copy instead. Another way of asking this question might be whether I can let the server-side file upload code to point the file directly to where it has to go, OR whether (if HTTP file upload isn't transaction) I really need to put in some additional server side code to do a two step process of (a) upload to temporary location and then (b) if successful then transfer it into the final location (but I'd still want to give the client an indication of whether the overall upload worked or not too), and (c) there are some database status fields to update also on the server side.

1081719,How to work with large files through JSON and PHP,"This is a programming logic question. How is millions of data best handled and processed? This question is getting down voted quite a bit. However I do believe that logic is a very important part of programming. My professors will teach us logic before syntax. Instead of downvoting, why not explain how you would go about this kind of situation? Here is the scenario: Goal: To graph csv data onto a line chart via six json arrays. There are 6 lines. At the end of the year each line will have accumulated 2,920,000 points each with a timestamp. Each day a new csv file will be created and somehow it needs to be processed into the graph. The files: Each day a new csv file will be created with about 8,000 pieces of data for 6 categories. The file will be manually added to the server. The data is vertical, meaning I need to grab a column of information rather than a row. Problem is, there is too much data for PHP to process through. What I have been trying: I tried globally grabbing all the csv files and turning them into 6 temporary json files through PHP. Then the graph would read the temporary files to display the graph. Then the files would be deleted. The problem with this method is that it recreates the json files each time the webpage loads. This means that each time there are more csv files to extract data from. Eventually there were too many csv files and the data could not load. Answer: So far it has been determined that a database might the best way to handle this amount of data.",[],False

We cancel on the left and right and we have $b^ja = ab^j$, that is $b^iba = ab^j$. Multiply both sides by $a^i$ on the left and we get $a^ib^iba = a^jb^j$, so $(ab)^iba = (ab)^j$.

In that same way i use several other command line tools and parse their output to poulate progress bars in my frontend. This works fine for the other tools but not for Sox since instead of spamming new lines for each progress step, it updates a single line on the console by only using carriage returns (\r) and no line feeds (\n). I tried both asynchronous and synchronous reads on . Using async in combination with doesn't produce any individual status updates because for some reason the carriage returns do not trigger ReadLine, even though the MSDN docs suggest that it should. The output is spit out in one chunk when the process finishes. I then tried the following code for synchronous char by char reads on the stream: The above code does not seem to read the stream in realtime but will stall output for a while. Then it spams a small chunk and finally deadlocks half-way through the process. Any hints towards the right direction would be greatly appreciated! UPDATE with (sloppy?) solution: This drove me crazy because nothing i tried on the C# side of things seemed to have any effect on the results. My original implementation, before changing it 15 times and introducing new dependencies, was fine. The problem is with sox and RedirectStandardError alone. I discovered that after grabbing the sox source code and building my own version. First i removed all output of sox entirely except for the stuff i was really interested in and then changing the output to full lines followed by a newline . I assumed that this would fix my issues. Well, it didn't. I do not know enough c++ to actually find out why, but they seem to have tempered with how stdio writes to that stream, how it's buffered or do it in such a special way that the streamreader on the c# side is not flushed until the default 4096 byte buffer is full. I confirmed that by padding each line to at least 4096 byte. So in conclusion all i had to do was to manually flush stderr in sox.c after each call in : Though, I'm not sure this is anywhere close to an elegant solution.

1418563,Group Policy behaves unexpectedly with GPOs at domain level,"So today, I'm going through and cleaning up/consolidating our GPOs and moved a couple from a second-level OU to the domain level. These (user) policies are used to block/allow access to the command prompt. By default, all users are blocked from using the command prompt. Users can then be added to a security group that has permission to run the second (higher precedence) GPO to turn it back on. When the GPOs are in the second level, they work as expected. But once I move them to domain level, all users are blocked from using the command prompt, to include the onces that should have access. Our GPOs are well segregated, and I verified there were no conflicting GPOs. Link order and policy inheritance precedence was verified. Group Policy results showed both policies applying on the appropriate users, yet command prompt access is still blocked. Moved the GPOs back down... and everything works again? What gives?

1470953,Eclipse RCP application in jruby,"I'm trying to write an Eclipse rcp application using only jruby, or at least with only the strictly necessary amount of java. As only a few lines of pure ruby code will give you a basic SWT application, I was hoping, that writing an rcp application in jruby should boil down to implementing a few classes, like IApplication, and so on... Disclaimer: I have been working with (j)ruby for several years but have almost no java or rcp experience for that matter. What seems viable is to stick with the template generated by Eclipse and call ruby classes from there. However: is it possible to use pure ruby? There seems to be some magic that glues all the classes of an rcp application together. A good deal of that magic probably resides in plugin.xml in the root directory of an rcp project. However, when I look at the command line of a running rcp application there are quite a lot of framework parameters... Searching for keywords like ""eclipse, rcp, jruby"" did not give me the result I hoped for. There is one project which essentially seems to be going in the direction of calling ruby classes from a java skeleton. No pure ruby. Purpose: the application I'm looking to write will process time series. This tasks nicely fits IMHO into the concept of perspectives in an rcp application: Select time series, Build a model, Analyze the result. Also, processing time series is nice in a workbench environment: you can have lots of windows open, group them, and so on... So, I guess, my primary question is: do you have any pointers, how to write an Eclipse rcp application in ruby? But I'm also open to completely different suggestions for the task at hand.

1494140,Webservices to image hosting on S3?,"I use Amazon S3 to store images used in my other Java applications. Recently I had to update my apps to introduce functionality like categories, tags and so on. For now this was resolved as JSON configs stored in S3. Those are fetched by other applications and used as some kind of DB replacement :). Other improvements like ratings and user feedbacks are still to be done. So moving to DB + backend with some webservices is next logical step. In first place I haven't used something like EC2 instance because of additional costs and maintenance issues. I need some recommendations how to implement this with min time and effort. So basic requirements are: - image are stored on s3 - web service provides methods to fetch category list, list of links to s3 for images in category, methods to update some image ratings, and possibly in future a method to resize image to provided dimentions. My thoughts are: - Use s3 as its already there. - add some Java hosting to run mentioned webservice (I don't like the idea of using EC2 as requires much more time for configuration that I'm willing to spend, maybe I'm wrong here). - use ""plain"" javaee or some light frameworks to get most of hardware. I also considered using some image hosting service, but I haven't found something simmilar. Or maybe there is some opensource solutions that can be used for image hosting.

1781801,Dynamic Python RPC,"TLDR: Dynamic RPC mechanisms in Python? I am working on a Python project using SQLAlchemy and Alembic that is then wrapped in Protocol Buffers for CLI interaction. The tool's selling point (at least for me) is to allow the modification of the underlying DB schema by the client on the fly. Basically, if the user would like to add a field to the POPO the library would take care of interacting with the server (and the underlying DB) to add the field. I'm thinking of using Protocol Buffers for it's efficiency but it like many other RPC mechanisms it requires a compilation phase into it's underlying IDL. I'm just curious if anyone has any ideas as to how to get something like this ""dynamic"". I've looked briefly at other RPC mechanisms but all of them have the same issue of being static in terms of the objects and fields they represent. I guess I could shell out on the server level and recompile the ProtBuf IDL on each change but I thought I would ask the interwebs if perhaps there is a better way that I simply haven't found or thought of to make RPC more dynamic in Python.

1783260,"Constantly varying download rate with a complex xen networking setup, why?","The network configuration in my Xen setup is the following: the dom0 has 3 network cards (eth0, eth1, eth2), 3 brigdes (xenbrE, xenbrI, xenbrD) and each brigde integrates the corresponding network card. Only xenbrD has an IP address configured (192.168.78.2, a private LAN) so that it can discuss with all domU. there's a domU that is a firewall/router and it also contains 3 virtual cards (eth0, eth1, eth2). It does masquerading for traffic going out on eth0 (the external interface which is part of xenbrE). My problem is that when I download a big file from the internet by HTTP in the dom0, the download rate is not stable. It goes up progressively and then stalls for a few seconds, and restart again going up progressively (and all this in loop until the download is complete). During the stalls, it looks all networking is blocked on the machine (noticed on interactive SSH sessions). If I do the same download but uses a (non-caching) HTTP proxy that runs in the firewall domU, the download rate is stable at its maximum value. How can I avoid this problem?

1860438,authentication token is encrypted but not signed - weakness?,"Through the years I've come across this scenario more than once. You have a bunch of user-related data that you want to send from one application to another. The second application is expected to ""trust"" this ""token"" and use the data within it. A timestamp is included in the token to prevent a theft/re-use attack. For whatever reason (let's not worry about it here) a custom solution has been chosen rather than an industry standard like SAML. To me it seems like digitally signing the data is what you want here. If the data needs to be secret, then you can also encrypt it. But what I see a lot is that developers will use symmetric encryption, e.g. AES. They are assuming that in addition to making the data ""secret"", the encryption also provides 1) message integrity and 2) trust (authentication of source). Am I right to suspect that there is an inherent weakness here? At face value it does seem to work, if the symmetric key is managed properly. Lacking that key, I certainly wouldn't know how to modify an encrypted token, or launch some kind of cryptographic attack after intercepting several tokens.

At first it seemed that the statement has no effect and I suspected my SQLAlchemy/Elixir versions to be too old, but then I found out that the connection to the PurchaseOrderPosition entity (which I didn't modify) made with causes the phone object to be written again.

JDO/Google-app-engine pattern. In this pattern the DAO layer is the only one that knows about JDO, thus this layer is the only one needing replacement if the data store changed. The Services layer calls the DAO layer and formats/manipulates the data s needed. My question is why the extra Service layer? At least initially it doesn't seem like the Service layer is adding much to the equation. I would naturally think to just write a DAO layer to encapsulate the JDO requests and manipulate and return the data. Can someone show me the rational for a separate Service layer, will this become obvious as the project becomes larges and more complex?",[],False

We are doing DB Optimization but as immediate solution we decided to create one more DB server in the way DB2 is exact replica of DB1 all the time. Currently we have only DB1, used for both read and write operations. Now we need to move all read operations to DB2 and keep write operations (generally in transactions) on DB1 as it is now. What are the possible ways to make those changes (On production server without much downtime) and if possible, with minimal code changes. Edit after first comment Based on link given by J0k and some other links, I'd done following on local dev environment. Created a test symfony 1.4 project Updated database.yml as follow Where database is exact replica of database except change in one test entry. On table row 26 (PK) column entries are and respectively. run symfony tasks Created a module and added following code: Run in the browser, output was, on write connection, result=WON //Correct expected output on Read connection, result=WON //Not correct. That should be WON1 I guess passing while creating both read/write connection is the issue but that how it was suggested in online examples. Can someone please suggest where I'm making the mistake? Edit: Few more input I updated debug echos in to check how it is returning the connection. Found that it is entering in following if (line 544-549) where are empty so returning write connection.

2246665,Examples using Active Directory/LDAP groups for permissions \ roles in Rails App,"I was wondering how other people implemented this scenario. I have an internal rails app ( inventory management, label printing, shipping,etc). I'm rewriting security on the system, cause the old way got to cumbersome to maintain ( users table, passwords, roles) - I used restful_authentication and roles. It was implemented about 3 years ago. I already implemented AuthLogic with ruby-ldap-net to authenticate users ( actually that was surprisingly easy, compared to how I struggled with other frameworks/languages before). Next step is roles. I already have groups defined in Active Directory - so I don't want to run a separate roles system in my rails app, I just want to reuse Active Directory groups - since that part of the system is already maintained for other purposes ( shared drives, backups, pc access, etc) So I was wondering if others had experience implementing permissions/roles in a rails app based on groups in Active Directory or LDAP. Also the roles requirements are pretty complex. Here is an example: For instance I have users that belong to the supervisors group in AD and to inventory dept, so I was that user to be able to run ""advanced"" tasks in invetory - adjust qty, run reports, however other ""supervisors"" from other departmanets, shouldn't be able to do this, also Top Management - should be able to use those reports (regardless weather they belong to the invetory or not), but not Middle Management, unless they are in inventory group. Admins of the system (Domain Admins) should have unrestricted access to the system , except for HR &amp; Finances part unless they are in HR ( like you don't want all system admins (except for one authorized one) to see personal info of other employees). I looked at acl9, cancan, aegis. I was wondering if there are any advantaged/cons to using one versus the other for this particular use of system access based on AD. Suggest other systems if you had good experience. Thank you!!!",[],False

Notes are added to the music staff like: Notes have a particle emitter, and this needs to be added to the parent.. I am of the opinion that doing something like: is not cool because I don't like the idea of notes controlling the staff--- I like to think of the staff as the one in control of what children it has. I honestly feel like this particle emitter should be a child of Note, since it technically is part of the note, not part of the music staff-- so adding it to the music staff inherently feels wrong. However, from what I understand about cocos2d, although you can add a child to a CCSprite, the sprites do not manage the drawing of their children, so this particle emitter would not be visible. That said, since as far as I know the only way to go about this is to add the emitter to the staff, I would prefer doing: However, a team member on my project feels this is ""backwards"" and ""dumb"", and that the note should add the emitter directly to its parent. I just seeking some feedback as to if my thoughts on this are indeed ""backwards"" and ""dumb"", or if I have a valid point… Also I am curious if there is another way to solve this problem, like adding the emitter directly to the note and making it draw its children somehow?","['// MusicStaff.m\n[self addChild:note];\n', '// Note.m\n[self.musicStaff addChild:self.emitter];\n', '// MusicStaff.m\n[self addChild:note];\n[self addChild:note.emitter];\n']",False

2291670,"Mahout - Clustering - ""naming"" the cluster elements","I'm doing some research and I'm playing with Apache Mahout 0.6 My purpose is to build a system which will name different categories of documents based on user input. The documents are not known in advance and I don't know also which categories do I have while collecting these documents. But I do know, that all the documents in the model should belong to one of the predefined categories. For example: Lets say I've collected a N documents, that belong to 3 different groups : Politics Madonna (pop-star) Science fiction I don't know what document belongs to what category, but I know that each one of my N documents belongs to one of those categories (e.g. there are no documents about, say basketball among these N docs) So, I came up with the following idea: Apply mahout clustering (for example k-mean with k=3 on these documents) This should divide the N documents to 3 groups. This should be kind of my model to learn with. I still don't know which document really belongs to which group, but at least the documents are clustered now by group Ask the user to find any document in the web that should be about 'Madonna' (I can't show to the user none of my N documents, its a restriction). Then I want to measure 'similarity' of this document and each one of 3 groups. I expect to see that the measurement for similarity between user_doc and documents in Madonna group in the model will be higher than the similarity between the user_doc and documents about politics. I've managed to produce the cluster of documents using 'Mahout in Action' book. But I don't understand how should I use Mahout to measure similarity between the 'ready' cluster group of document and one given document. I thought about rerunning the cluster with k=3 for N+1 documents with the same centroids (in terms of k-mean clustering) and see whether where the new document falls, but maybe there is any other way to do that? Is it possible to do with Mahout or my idea is conceptually wrong? (example in terms of Mahout API would be really good) Thanks a lot and sorry for a long question (couldn't describe it better) Any help is highly appreciated P.S.

I already know of the method when an image is uploaded to resize it and save, but I have another thought in mind.

So for example a user goes to upload an image and I DO NOT RESIZE it and save another copy of the resized image. Instead, when the image is requested by the user via an ASP.NET img control/tag it would resize the image on the fly to display it and display it via the img tag/control. Why would I want to do this? To save on disk space. Most servers have a disk space limit, but not a server processing limit. So I would like to save on disk space and use the processing space instead.

2612644,Detect if user navigates away from form and only one user to select one date,"In my system I've tried various things. At the moment the user enters information onto a form, including selecting a date from a drop down menu which is filled with dates that are on mysql database. The thing is I only want one user to be able to select a certain date at a time and if they finish the form then the date is no longer available at all in the future. I'm not really sure what to do other than delete the date chosen from the table of dates that are run into the drop down menu. But if the user navigates away from the page, after that date has been deleted, it means the date is not in use but no longer in the date list so can't automatically be used again unless I re-enter it. Is there a way for a user to select a date and not allow other users to select that date while this other user is filling in the rest of the form, but also if this user decides not to complete the form, the date is somehow placed back into the database to be used again by another user asap. I was thinking maybe finding a way to see if the user navigates away from the page, if they do to feed that date back into the table, but im not sure this is possible in php (i've seen example in javascript, but thats not helpful when i need to enter the date into mysql using php?).

2629774,How simple TSL/SSL encryption works,"I read from Wiki about TSL/SSL but there is something it seems a bit confusing for me In order to generate the session keys used for the secure connection, the client encrypts a random number (RN) with the server's public key (PbK), and sends the result to the server. Only the server should be able to decrypt it (with its private key (PvK)): this is the one fact that makes the keys hidden from third parties, since only the server and the client have access to this data. The client knows PbK and RN, and the server knows PvK and (after decryption of the client's message) RN. A third party is only able to know RN if PvK has been compromised. From the random number, both parties generate key material for encryption and decryption. ref: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSL/TLS It says that if the PvK is compromised then RN is also compromised, isn't that RN is the key to encrypt the message and what is the point if it is compromised?

There are 2 columns in the database - a ""src"" column and a ""dest"" column. At present there are no indices.

Firstly, SELECT * FROM links WHERE src=434923 AND dest=5010182. Now this returns one result fairly quickly and then takes quite a long time to run as I assume it's performing a tablescan on the rest of the 600m rows. However, if I do SELECT DISTINCT * FROM links, then it immediately starts returning rows really quickly. The question is: how is this possible?? Surely for each row, the row must be compared against all of the other rows in the table, but this would require a tablescan of the remaining rows in the table which SHOULD takes ages!

2718421,How to change localization after an iPad app has been started,"i am currently working on an iPad app (iOS SDK v3.2). The app is localized in several languages, i.e. english, german, russian, ... I want the user to be able to switch the localization for some UI elements after the app has been started. What is the best way to achieve this? NSLocalizedString always chooses the locale defined in the system preferences, so that won't help. Note: the localization is all done by using .strings files, there are no localized NIBs in my project. To make the whole process more clear, here's an example: When the app is started the UI is displayed in english. The user can select a different language from a UITableView and parts of the UI get updated with the chosen language. Do i have to manually load the specific Localizable.strings file and parse it all the way through or is there a better option, to get the relevant strings? Any helpful advice is appreciated.

Currently, the websites are all on HTTP only, each site has its own IP address on each box and it available on a public url like a.mysite.com, b.mysite.com and c.mysite.com The client has asked me to switch everything to run under HTTPS and also to try to configure the following setup: create a new domain (under https) https://main.mysite.com with https://main.mysite.com/a/ mappng to a.mysite.com, https://main.mysite.com/b/ mappng to b.mysite.com etc The primary goal is to switch all 3 sites to HTTPS. The unified under 1 domain thing is a ""nice to have"". The client has this belief that certificates are expensive, are they? First of all, I know nothing about buying certificates, setting up SSL etc, so any links to a beginners guide to HTTPS would be greatly appreciated. A rough idea of cert prices would be nice too. Second, because the webserver software needs a recompile to run under SSL, I'm interested in solutions to this that allow me not to change the webserver software. Would this be a reverse proxy?

2810239,How to center progress indicator in ProgressDialog easily (when no title/text passed along),"When calling usually the developers wants to only show the progress indication image, and usually would it expect to be centered within the window (at least from regular UI design point of view).

It would just make life little easier for a developer :) So we don't need to create a custom dialog only in order to have the progress indicator being centered by default.

2894528,Stop browser to make HTTP requests for images that should stay cached - mod_expires,"After reading many articles and some questions on here, I finally succeded in activating the Apache to tell the browser it MUST cache images for 1 year. And thankfully server responses seem to be correct: Well, I thought this would stop the browser to download and even inquire the server about the images for 1 year. But it's partially true: cause if you close and reopen the browser, the browser does NOT download the images from server anymore, but browser still inquires the server with an HTTP request for each image. How do I force browser to stop making HTTP requests for each image? Even if these HTTP requests are not followed by an image being downloaded, they are still requests made to the server that unecessarely icrease latency and slow down the page rendering! I already told the browser it MUST keep the images in cache for 1 year! Why does browser still inquire the server for each image (even if it does not download the image)?! Images) I can see different caching behaviours (I obviously started with the browser cache completly empty, I forced a cache delete on browser using ""Clear All History""): When the page is loaded for the 1st time all images are downloaded (and same thing happens if I force a page reload by clicking on the browser's reload page button). This makes sense! When I navigate the site and get back to the same page the images are not downloaded at all and the browser does NOT even inquire the server for any of the images. This makes sense, (and I would like to see this behaviour also when browser is closed)! When I close the browser and open it again on the same page, the silly browser makes anyway HTTP request to the server one time per image: it does NOT downalod the image, but it still makes an HTTP request, it's like the browser inquires the server about the image (server replies with 200 OK). This is the one that irritates me! I also attach the graphs below if you are interested: EDIT: just tested now also with FireFox 11.0 just to make sure it wasn't an issue of my FireFox 3.6 being too old. The same thing happens!!! I also tested Google site and Stackoverflow site, they do both send the but the browser still makes an HTTP request to the server for each image once the browser is closed and opened again on the same page, after server response the browser does NOT download the image (as I explained above) but it still makes the damn request that increases time to see page.

(Here P is the perimeter of the triangle. Sum of the sides. And A is the area of the triangle. a*b/2 in a triangle with a b c and c is the hypotenuse) Obviously for the simple cases such triangles exists. For an example when $ A=2P \qquad $ the triangle $12,16,20$ works $ A=P \qquad \; \; $ the triangle $6,8,10$ works $2A=P \qquad $ the triangle $3,4,5$ works I tried solving this by hand, first for the special case where $2P=A$.

Sadly I was not able to continue from here. I have only learned how to solve linear Diophantine equations. Not a system of nonlinear Diophantine equations.

However, the well-known site sent an automated protest to my hosting service (ServerBeach) and domain registrar (GoDaddy).

3039495,How can I speed up my loop calling a command line tool in ASP.NET?,"I have an ASP.NET page that gets a list of game server ip addresses (quickly) and loops through them running a command line tool against them to get special game server information. I have to use the command line tool because I don't know how it works to get the information from the machines and I don't want to reinvent the wheel. The looping is the slow part (surprise surprise). Each command line tool run takes up to a second so with approximately 60 ip addresses polled on average, the page load can take from 30-60 seconds to render the results I need. My obvious thought was ""multithread that thing!"" Well, I tried that w/ thread pools but ended up with a hanging website if more than one person accessed the page at a time. This was only using 4-5 calls at a time up to the 60 making it a 10 sec load time. So not only did it hang with multiple users, it was still too slow. I'd be happy if I could get it to under 3 seconds. I should mention this page is in a shared hosting environment.

The simple example shows a view with the following fields: hourlyRate, WorkHours, Standarthours , salary. The example is devided into 3 parts : View - contains some text fiels and a table (the table contains a list of employees' data). Controller - comprised of NSArrayController class (contains an array of MyEmployee) Model - MyEmployee class which describes an employee. MyEmployee class has one method which return the salary according to the calculation logic, and attributes in accordance with the view UI controls. MyEmployee inherits from NSManagedObject.

Inside the MyEmplpyee class implemenation file, the calculation method gets the class attributes using sentence like "" [[self valueForKey:@""hourlyRate""] floatValue];"" Howevern, inside the header there is no data member named hourlyRate or any of the view fields. I'm not quite sure how does it work, and how it gets the value from the right view field. (does it have to be the same name as the field name in the view). maybe the conncetion is made somehow using the Interface builder and was not shown in the book ? and more important: 2. how does it seperate the view from the model ? let's say ,as the book implies might happen, I decide one day to remove one of the fields in the view. as far as I understand, that means changing the way the salary method works in MyEmplpyee (cause we have one field less) , and removing one attribute from the same calss.

3156554,WCF problem passing complex types,"I have a service contract that defines a method with a parameter of type System.Object (xs:anyType in the WSDL). I want to be able to pass simple types as well as complex types in this parameter. Simple types work fine, but when I try to pass a complex type that is defined in my WSDL, I get this error: Element 'http://tempuri.org/:value' contains data of the 'http://schemas.datacontract.org/2004/07/MyNamespace:MyClass' data contract. The deserializer has no knowledge of any type that maps to this contract. Add the type corresponding to 'MyClass' to the list of known types - for example, by using the KnownTypeAttribute attribute or by adding it to the list of known types passed to DataContractSerializer. Adding it as a known type doesn't help because it's already in my WSDL. How can I pass an object of a complex type via an ""xs:anyType"" parameter? More info: I believe this works when using NetDataContract, but I can't use that because my client is Silverlight. I have seen references to complex types explicitly extending xs:anyType, but I have no idea how to make WCF generate a WSDL that does that, and I have no idea whether or not it would even help.

3186716,c# and garbage collection,"There must be a secret in .NET garbage collection that I don't understand as for now. Our C# WinForms application has a dialog that loads very many objects via a OR mapper tool. This process consumes a lot of memory and we think that most of this memory could be consumed by strings. When we open this dialog, the task menager shows 900MB of memory usage and by doing the query again, we get a out of memory exception. Whow. Now we got the tipp that some type of garbage collection is done when we minimize the application. By doing this and maximizing it again, the application only consumes 10MBs. Cool. But now, when we do the query again, the memory consumption suddenly jumps back to 900MB and we get the out of memory exception again. What happens here and how can we reduce our memory consumption?

3233517,"SQLAlchemy says ""Table already exists"" though it doesn't","I would like to use SQLAlchemy ORM not only for querying a database, but also to create the tables. So I connect to the empty schema of my database: I have a few classes which looks similar to the following example: To create the database I call: This works fine - the FIRST time. If I now drop the tables manually from the database OR calling and restart the script (hence call again) I get an error that my tables already exists: I can clearly say, that this is not true. I am able to create a table with the same name using CREATE TABLE from my CLI tool AND also if I now stop the database daemon and start it again, I will be able to create the tables again using .

But if I try to query this none existing table it will tell me, that the table does not exist. I googled around but wasn't able to find an explanation for this behavior.

3237501,Tips on creating user interfaces and optimizing the user experience,"I am currently working on a project where a lot of user interaction is going to take place. There is also a commercial side as people can buy certain items and services. In my opinion a good blend of user interface, speed and security is essential for these types of websites. It is fairly easy to use ajax and JavaScript nowadays to do almost everything, as there are a lot of libraries available such as jQuery and others. But this can have some performance and incompatibility issues. This can lead to users just going to the next website. The overall look of the website is important too. Where to place certain buttons, where to place certain types of articles such as faq and support. Where and how to display error messages so that the user sees them but are not bothering him. And an overall color scheme is important too. The basic question is: How to create an interface that triggers a user to buy/use your services I know psychology also plays a huge role in how users interact with your website. The color scheme for example is important. When the colors are irritating on a website you just want to click away. I have not found any articles that explain those concept.

3251705,Sandbox timeout on ItemAdded receiver,"I'm currently working on a solution which has to work in the Office365 SharePoint Online environment. Being Sandboxed, I'm running into problems with my code which is working fine on my local environment. The setup is pretty simple. I have a list where users can create items. After creating an item, an event receiver picks it up and processes the item. The event receiver creates a site based on the users input in the list. This operation seems to take too long sometimes. After the site creation, the URL of the newly created site is saved back to the list item. This sometimes happens, but mostly doesn't. I'm pretty sure it's the 30sec timeout which is causing this. Because the operation is kind of async to begin with, I don't really care about the sequence of event. Therefore I thought I might be able to use the client model or webservices instead. Fire off an async call to create the web and thereby bypassing the 30 sec timeout. Has someone ever been able to do this? I know the client model isn't restricted to timeouts, but I don't think the sandbox allows you to use the client model (which is kind of strange to begin with I guess).",[],False

Since the assignment is on Hashtables, I cannot use Hashmaps, as several people have reccommended, and condemned me for not doing. So far, this is all I can come up with as sad as it may be. In order to solve the problem I've been assigned, I need to use a hashtable of integers, but Java isn't allowing this...do you know why?

So I have something like this URI and the returned data The URI ends in the plural version of the common noun, and the QUERY_STRING is used to filter the return set. The root node in the return ""hash"" is the common noun that was queried, and its key is an array each element of which is a hash with key/value pairs.

3396523,nHibernate performance issue when loading large collections,"(just to make clear: my app isn't really about employees and departments. I just use these terms for example's sake). Each department has an employees collection, which is lazily-loaded. Whenever I add a new employee I want to make sure It doesn't already exist in the collection, so I load the collection to memory and perform the check on it. Problem is- in production environment, I have some departments with 10,000+ employees. I found that fetching the collection and then saving the new employee takes A LOT of time. I've done a little experment, in which I copied the exact same select statement generated by nH to ADO.Net SQLDataAdapter. Here are the results: as you can see- fetching takes ~15 secs with nH, compared to ~2 secs with ADO.Net. From researching around a bit I know that nH probably isn't meant to be used to store that many items in session. Can you think of any other possible reason for this problem, or of another suggestion other than filtering the Employees at the DB level? thanks --EDIT-- Following the below suggestions i've tried using Reflection Optimizer (made no difference), and IStatelessSession for loading my collection (throws an exception- collections cannot be fetched by a stateless session.).

Part of the convenience is that a regular expression can be specified with just a String, rather than the #""re"" notation. The one part I can't figure out is how to get the macro to take the String and rewrite it as a Clojure regex (e.g., produce the #""re"" notation). I think it's a syntax / escaping problem. My first naive attempt (pretending I only want the String-to-regex part): Is it even possible to do what I'm trying to do?

I ultimately want to find the red, green, and blue values and calculate average RGB brightness across all colored pixels in all images from a particular date. This means being able to somehow differentiate colored pixels from near-white pixels and store their values. I think what I want to do is create color histograms for a number of test images, look at the histograms' peaks to determine thresholds for what constitutes a ""white"" or ""colored"" pixel, then loop over the pixels in each image to find the colored ones matching my threshold(s) (I do know how to read in an image and get the pixel RGB values). In my preferred language, Python, it sounds like I'd use the histogram method from the Image module in PIL, but I don't know the R equivalent (this may just be a weak point in my google-fu; search results are mostly for ""R"" as in ""red"" rather than the language. I did find this: R: Histogram, but I'm at a loss for whether it's relevant/how to use it). If there might be a better approach from the domain of signal/image processing, I'd love to hear that, too.

So I have a set of employees. Employees have roles. There's a few pages with rather complex permissions, and I'd like to make sure those are tested. I created a DataSet that has each type of role (there's about 15 roles in our app): and what I'd like to do is write a functional test that checks only the right people can access a page. (The actual permissions are way more complicated, I just wanted a toy example to show you.) Something like this: Is there a way to generate the fixture data so my devs don't have to remember to add a line to the fixtures every time we add a role? We have the canonical list of all roles as configuration elsewhere in the app, so I have that.

3569563,Best practice for a practical real-time app with .NET MVC4,"Hello people and bots, I'm developing the front-end web application for a system and have hit a little problem. The whole application has to be on one page, meaning no refreshes or page changes during the flow of the major areas of the application. It also has to work in all web browsers including IE7 and be deploy-able as a HTML5 application for tablets and mobile phones. It's based around a user logging in, which is regulated by webforms authentication, then I need to poll or long-poll the server for updates. This would be simple if I could do a request for each part of the system, however if the system gets too big session blocking becomes a problem and it could also end up ddosing itself. So what I need to do is think of a way to send one request and build one response from that request. My first idea was to build a response model with JSON or XML and let JavaScript regulate what needs to be updated. For example, a new comment has been made on a topic, all the clients see this update near instantly. My idea was to send something like this: JavaScript would then parse this and add ""haha"", and ""lol"" to the element with the id ""topic1"". In theory it seems quite simple to achieve, but as the system is getting bigger it seems to constantly be turning into a big mess. My second idea was to simply have a set of client-side functions for adding and removing stuff in the DOM, And then use a JSONP technique to call this function. Response: Personally I find both methods a rather annoying workaround for nothing more than simple broadcasting. I was wondering if anyone else has ever had the same problems and if they have ever come up with a more creative solution.

It will be some sort of a complex windows form application. I think and as per most suggestions, C# will be the best to use. The tree structure on the left of the GUI will populate after reading from a configuration file which will be a binary file . (but initially I can work with a simple ASCII file to test my code.). The application will accept some inputs from the user through this GUI and will write the back to the same config file and will reflect the changes in the tree structure or the labels or any other pertaining field on the form. There will be 3 tabs and 3 corresponding config files for each of the tabs. I need some help designing the application for now. I am planning to make a host application (main application) and use the 3 tab controls as plugins. Is this workable ? If so can you please guide me on this. I mean how do I make 3 plugins in C# and how do I write the interfaces so that the main application knows which plugin to load and when to load it ? Will there be a separate “Plugin” folder under my project folder ? I hope you got my point though this is too little of an information for you to begin with. Also there are some .cpp files already existing in the project. These files along with some .h files contain some important definitions and constants in them. These need to be integrated with my C# application.

Define a relation $R$ on $F$ by: for any $f,g\in F$, $fRg$ if and only if $f - g$ is a constant function; that is, there is a constant $c$ so that $f(x) - g(x) = c$ for all $x\in A$.

Attempted solution: By definition $g(x) - h(x) = c$, from which we can write that $g(a) - h(a) = c$ and $g(b) - h(b) = c$. Now if we plug in the initial values: $1 - h(a) = c$ and $g(b) - 1 = c$.

3733373,Why does MySQL replication use five certificates?,"I'm attempting to set up MySQL replication with SSL encryption, and while I'm beginning to close in on the solution, there's one aspect of the process that I can't wrap my brain around relating to the way MySQL uses SSL. According to the documentation on MySQL 5.0 (setting up SSL for client/server and setting up SSL for replication), the SSL connection can involve up to five pieces of information: the CA cert, the master's signed public and private keys, and the slave's signed public and private keys. What I don't understand is the need for these five components. My understanding of SSL (gleaned from the Wikipedia entry) is that SSL generally requires only three pieces: the CA certificate (shared by server and client), the server's public key (sent to the client, validated against the CA cert, and used to encrypt / decrypt communication to the server), and the server's private key (kept by the server and use to encrypt / decrypt communication to client). So why in the MySQL replication SSL solution does the slave also have a public/private key pair signed against the same CA cert as the master's public/private key pair?",[],False

3769897,Is there still any legitimate reason (in 2011) to use proxy servers instead of NAT for sharing an internet connection?,"Proxies were around before NAT, and so early on in the internet, they were popular ways to get an entire network online with only a single public IP. NAT initially required complex software and/or hardware to get it working, and so understandably some organizations still used proxy servers to provide access. In the last decade however, NAT has become immensely popular, and is available in virtually every router on the market. The hardware is so fast and cheap that unless you are trying to use a $50 home router to run say, a 5000 person office, you're not going to have issues. Firewalls are also smart enough to do complex authentication, easily allowing different users to access different services at different times of day (even the most basic home routers often have this functionality built-in). In fact, NAT is likely easier to set up and manage than a proxy server. In my job I still often deal with clients using proxy servers to provide internet access, and the ensuing issues that arise from authentication, what account services are running as, etc. This includes some companies that are very big and old (and so I guess got their network installed over a decade ago, and just kept it that way) as well as relatively new organizations that have only a few years old.

3932751,Doubts regarding Server side session using caching or cookie based sessions,"I am pretty new to web development. I am working with Flask, Sqlalchemy and Postgresql. As far as I have understood, every new request is like a new thread of the program. New sqlalchemy session is created using which we manage our db operations and return a response. After that new thread is also closed and connections returned to the pool. I login a user and get all user data in an user orm object. I stored it in flask session variable which uses cookie. Now I also want to save some other user related data for the span of whole user session not a request. I have doubts storing all that data in a cookie for 2 reasons: Are my doubts valid? So my other questions are : Am I right on some level to avoid getting some session wide data in each request without getting into the trap of premature optimization? or Should I worry about this later when need arises and right now concentrate only on creating a working app? Alternative to cookie based session is server side session which can be done by using redis or memcache. Where does Beaker library comes into this? Is it a standalone thing or to be used in conjunction with redis or memcache?",['1. Unnecessary data travel back and forth.\n2. data can be read easily.\n'],True

3942836,Creating a 1D Vector and Assigning Values by Reference C++,"I'm a novice coder, just a few months into learning C++. This is my second question on Stack Overflow, and I really hope that the answers will benefit me and others. I started working on this program because I wanted to create a vector engine that could create a 1D vector, assign a value to any position in that 1D vector (by abstracting width and height to simulate 2D), and then print out said vector. The end goal of a project like this would be to later have a rendering engine that would convert the int values in this vector to image tiles on the screen using SDL or equivalent. I previously made a program that could do something similar using a vector of objects each containing a character, but I didn't pass values by reference, so I really wanted to nail passing values by reference in this program. The code compiles just fine, and the cout statements in the assignToVector function seem to indicate that the value is being assigned properly. But when I call the final print statement, the value that I want to pass into the vector is not properly outputted. I'm using vector.erase to clear the position before assigning a value to it, and vector.assign to input the value, if that helps narrow down the problem. I really appreciate the time anyone spends answering this question! Thank you! EDIT: The suggestion made by chris below fixed the first part of the problem (change std::cout &lt;&lt; printerVector[*it] TO std::cout &lt;&lt; *it). However I find I needed to add a position--; after I create it in order to align the value properly. Basically, the inputted width and height values don't match their actual position on the grid.

4046873,Incorrect classpath to NumberPickerButton from Quietly Coding NumberPicker,"= API 8. For compatibility reasons, the application uses Actionbar Sherlock. Before API 11, the NumberPicker was an internal widget, but I need the NumberPicker, so I had to come up with another solution. After some Googling, I stumbled upon this NumberPicker from Mike Novak. I implemented it but unfortunately, when I click on the preference that should bring up the dialog with the numberpicker, the application crashes. It seems there is something wrong with the reference to the layout (logcat says is used) file, but the source references to as you can see here. LogCat output: res/xml/main_preferences.xml SettingsActivity.java The error doesn't make any sense to me, since I never used . Neither the NumberPicker lib does. Things I did trying to solve this problem: How to use NumberPicker from QuietlyCoding in preferences? Double checked the library project is referenced correct Cleaned the project (including all libs) Any thoughts?","['com.example.widget.NumberPicker',

4109914,Peg solitaire – checking pegs vs. checking holes in a depth-first search,"I am trying to solve Peg Solitaire with a depth-first search algorithm – it should be possible to solve the game since ""modern computers can easily examine all game positions in a reasonable time"". Even after 23 hours, the algorithm didn't find any solution. I did a web search and found the paper ""Depth-first search solves peg solitaire"". I tried the c-program from the paper and the first solution was found immediately after the program started. I compared the algorithms. The main difference between the algorithms is the way they find possible peg-jumps. While my algorithm searches the board for holes from top left to bottom right (each hole is checked if there are possible jumps), the paper-algorithm searches the board for pegs from top left to bottom right (each peg is checked if there are possible jumps). Both algorithms are trying the jumps in the order they are found. To underline the difference: Analyzing holes: Runtime 23 hours no solution Analyzing pegs: Runtime 10 seconds, 2940 solutions Question: Why is there such a giant (not solvable / immediately solved) difference on how to search the board for jumps? Why is it better to check the pegs instead of checking the holes for possible jumps? You can try the algorithm with following C++ program. To keep it compact I have removed the lesser important parts (printing the board, generating the initial bitboard, ...). #include &lt;iostream&gt; #include &lt;ctime&gt; #include &lt;vector&gt; #include &lt;utility&gt; #include &lt;ctime&gt; typedef unsigned __int64 ui64; typedef std::vector&lt;std::pair&lt;int, int&gt; &gt; vecjumps; // first=from, second=to ui64 moves = 0; // Number of moves made so far int solutions = 0; // Number of solutions found so far clock_t start; // To measure time // Bitboard // Board Bits // ------------------------------ // *** 02 03 04 // *** 10 11 12 // ******* 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 // ***o*** 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 // ******* 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 // *** 42 43 44 // *** 50 51 52 const ui64 bitboard = 0x001c1c7f7f7f1c1c; // 1ULL &lt;&lt; 2 | 1ULL &lt;&lt; 3 | ... ui64 board = bitboard &amp; ~(1ULL &lt;&lt; 27); // Initial Board: Bit 27 &lt;=&gt; Hole // To try the hole-version: Swap Commented and Uncommented parts vecjumps getMoves(ui64 b) { // Find the possible jumps through bit-shift operations. mr &lt;=&gt; right jump // possibilities.

4124322,"If $f\colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is such that $f (x + y) = f (x) f (y)$ and continuous at $0$, then continuous everywhere","Prove that if $f\colon\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is such that $f(x+y)=f(x)f(y)$ for all $x,y$, and $f$ is continuous at $0$, then it is continuous everywhere. If there exists $c \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(c) = 0$, then $$f(x + c) = f(x)f(c) = 0.$$ As every real number $y$ can be written as $y = x + c$ for some real $x$, this function is either everywhere zero or nowhere zero. The latter case is the interesting one. So let's consider the case that $f$ is not the constant function $f = 0$. To prove continuity in this case, note that for any $x \in \mathbb{R}$ $$f(x) = f(x + 0) = f(x)f(0) \implies f(0) = 1.$$ Continuity at $0$ tells us that given any $\varepsilon_0 &gt; 0$, we can find $\delta_0 &gt; 0$ such that $|x| &lt; \delta_0$ implies $$|f(x) - 1| &lt; \varepsilon_0.$$ Okay, so let $c \in \mathbb{R}$ be fixed arbitrarily (recall that $f(c)$ is nonzero). Let $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. By continuity of $f$ at $0$, we can choose $\delta &gt; 0$ such that $$|x - c| &lt; \delta\implies |f(x - c) - 1| &lt; \frac{\varepsilon}{|f(c)|}.$$ Now notice that for all $x$ such that $|x - c| &lt; \delta$, we have $$\begin{align*} |f(x) - f(c)| &amp;= |f(x - c + c) - f(c)|\\ &amp;= |f(x - c)f(c) - f(c)|\\ &amp;= |f(c)| |f(x - c) - 1|\\ &amp;\lt |f(c)| \frac{\varepsilon}{|f(c)|}\\ &amp;= \varepsilon. \end{align*}$$ Hence $f$ is continuous at $c$. Since $c$ was arbitrary, $f$ is continuous on all of $\mathbb{R}$. Is my procedure correct?",[],False

Let's say we have a class Human and we live in a world where sometimes the human walks (the brain commands the legs), where sometimes trees disappear (the human notices that) and sometimes humans randomly hit each other. The first two cases are really a no-brainer: Now I've got a really bad problem with the hit method. Of course it's nice that you can say Up until here I think it's nice (please complain if something's bad) and reads like prose (which good OOP code should). But how do you transfer the hitting into OOP? If Anna hits Bob and Bob falls down then the falling down is neither directly caused by Anna nor Bob. It's caused by the hit, a loss of balance and by physics. I know only 2 options for this case, but somehow I think both suck: In this case Anna ""falls down"" Bob. But this totally doesn't make any sense. It's not like Anna grabs Bob's body and moves it towards the ground. But there's another option: In this case Bob's body ""notices"" that the hit is causing him to fall to the ground, he'll then ""move himself"" to the ground. I think this is better than the first option but this still somehow doesn't feel right.

If I delete a row in a particular table, I want the ability to be able to reverse that delete at some point in the future, in case of a mistake. I could do this using an is_deleted column and filter on that, but that becomes a pain when I'm querying other tables for related data. I could add an is_deleted column to all the other tables, and when a row from the main table is deleted, toggle them all. But then for every query on all the tables I'd have to filter on is_deleted. It can be done, but I'm hoping there's a better strategy. One thought would be to move all the deleted data to another set of tables, that only store deleted data. But it's unclear to me if SQLAlchemy allows me to switch the table a particular object is associated with. I think this would be the preferred solution, but I don't know if it can be done. Another thought is that I could run a second database, and copy the deleted data over. But that adds a layer of administration complexity that I'd like to avoid.

It's mostly color, line and padding stuff for the DataGrid.) The problem that is for both Label and cells in the DataGrid the text is being rendered as sort of a times new roman font. The headers in the DataGrid are fine, just the text in the cells is wonky. All other components use the correct font as defined in the CSS/SWF. Any ideas why this is happening?",[],False

There are 2 components to this layout. First, vertically &amp; horizontally centering the content between the header and footer (which is a sticky footer). I have the code in a fiddle to demonstrate but I haven't been able to get this to work in IE (the code is at the bottom of the post). http://jsfiddle.net/UnsungHero97/yZPwu/4/embedded/result/ The second component is where the green arrow is pointing. That represents a hidden element which is meant to expand vertically downwards when clicking on some of the text. However, I DO NOT WANT this expansion to move the content upward as if everything was being centered... I want this element to expand downwards without affecting the position of the content AND pushing the sticky footer down as it expands. In most cases, a browser scrollbar will appear. So the effect of the hidden element expanding should be like a banner falling off an edge. This is what the layout should look like after the hidden element has been expanded: QUESTION So how would I achieve this layout using only CSS and have it be cross-browser compatible Please let me know if I need to explain further to clarify confusion.

What I am wondering about is: the book gives the answer $$\frac{d^2V}{dq^2}=\frac{(2q-3V-3)}{(1-V)^2}$$ How can I simplify my answer to get what they got, or in the case that my answer is completely wrong, could someone explain how to get to their answer.",[],False
4697841,Amazon EC2 postgresql backups: Snapshot the data directory or pg_dump onto an EBS volume that is snapshotted consistently?,"I have a postgresql database on amazon EC2 and need to determine the best way to keep this data backed up. I am considering two options: (1) Mount an EBS volume to some directory like /pgsqldata and use this directory as the postgresql data directory (on Amazon Linux the default is /var/lib/pgsql/data/). Then this volume would get frequent snapshots. or (2) Keep the postgresql data directory in it's default location. Then use pg_dump to frequently dump backups to a location like /pgsqldumps and that volume will get a snapshot after each pg_dump. A third option would be to simply snapshot the root device volume (I am using an EBS-backed instance) since it is both a webserver and database in my case. I like the idea of having a dedicated volume for data backups though. Finally, if I am taking direct snapshots of the live postgresql data directory, do I need to worry about possible changes to the database during the snapshot process? Thanks",[],False

There are many things like this : If I delete truck (i.e. Vehicle from Truck management tab) it should show message box ""Truck deleted successfully."" and if car (i.e. Vehicle from Car management tab) is deleted ""Car deleted successfully"" message should be shown.

The problematic computer is operating with (PC2) Windows 7 Professional The running-fine computer is running (PC1) Windows Vista Business The problem occured when I turned off my Cisco Catalyst 3500 series switch so that I can move it to another location (5 feet away). I then recoeecnted the Ethernet cables and my cable modem to the switch. The PC1 then reinitialized the network, found the settings and reconnected properly! Internet is then running just fine as if I had never touched it in my life! Great! I can't tell the same with PC2, sadly. It began to identify the network, then set it to over and over again though I have tried solving with the troubleshooter. Here's what I did so far: I read this linked in answer article to know what's NLA. What settings does Windows use to determine network location? I have also read this: LAN - Unidentified Network (No Network Access) on Windows 7 I have also tried: Setting the DHCP Broadcast Flag to 0 so no more broadcast; Running a Powershell script that was suppoed to set all Unidentified network to private; Went and change manually Unidentified network setting from ""unknown"" to ""private""; Forced , typed in a fake IP in my Local Connection, saved the seetings, then clicked the ""Obtain an IP automatically option, and ; Setting proper DNS IP though PC1 is set to obtain them automatically (and works, not PC2); Disabled the adapter, uninstalled and reinstalled it, and enabled it; To stop the NLA and related services with no luck (didn't solve my problem); Rolledback to previous working settings/configuration with a restore point, and it netiehr solved the problem.

When a user click's the save , I would like to show an animation. I have been able to achieve this by exposing a property ShowMessage and setting it to True and a picks up this value and starts an animation. However, while the animation is still active, I would like to reset the form to a clean state. So far I've done the reset by subscribing to the event on the and resetting the view model's state on that event. Ideally I would like to be able to somehow trigger an animation from the view model (because the save would be an asynchronous operation) and let the animation run to completion. The way I have it now wouldn't work because once I change the value of the ShowMessage property (on the reset), the animation stops and doesn't run to completion. Does any one have a better solution?

4862054,How to improve the amount of memory used by Jboss?,"I have a JEE application running on jboss-5.0.0.GA. The application uses BIRT report tool to generate several reports. The server has 4 cores of 2.4 Ghz and 8 Gb of ram. The startup script is using the next options: The application has reached some stability with this configuration, some time ago I had a lot of crashes because of the memory was totally full. Rigth now, the application is not crashing, but memory is always fully used. Example of top command: The java process shows a use of 2.6g, and this is the only application running on this server. What can I do to ensure an amount of free memory? What can I do to try to find a memory leak? Any other suggestion? TIA Based in answer by mezzie: If you are using linux, what the kernel does with the memory is different with how windows work. In linux, it will try to use up all the memory. After it uses everything, it will then recycle the memory for further use. This is not a memory leak. We also have jboss tomcat on our linux server and we did research on this issue a while back.

4920502,Android receive images from Gallery in order,"I currently have an Android application that has an intent-filter to receive images from the Gallery. It is important that the images are received in the same order that the user selected them in. This seems to be the default behavior on most devices, however on some devices (so far I've seen this on Motorola's running Android 4.x) the order seems undefined. Does anyone know a way to declare in the intent that the images should be received in order? Or a way once the images are recieved to determine the selected order? Here is relevant code from the manifest And from ImportImagesActivity EDIT To give a little context, let me explain the general flow of the app. The user opens the Gallery and selects images. They choose to 'Share' them with my app. My application receives a list of Uri's which are then displayed using an internal gallery backed by a custom Adapter class. The images display correctly based on the Uri list, the issue is the order of the List&lt;Uri&gt; is sometimes incorrect. It is important to my users that the images appear in the same order they select them in. Clarification When I use the term Gallery I am referring to the built in Android app Gallery. When I use the term 'Share' I am referring to the the Share button within the Gallery app. This allows the user to select from a list of services such as Facebook, Email, and in this case my app. For Example Image a Gallery with 3 images, displayed in an arbitrary order: A, B, and C. The user selects first C then A then B and chooses to share them with my app. On most phones my list will be correctly ordered {C, A, B}, on offending phones this order seems random. I cannot use the creation timestamp because the creation time is generally irrelevant to the selection order. Adding custom meta data doesn't help either because I don't know the correct initial order.","[' &lt;activity\n       android:label=""@string/app_name""\n       android:name="".activities.ImportImagesActivity"" &gt; \n       &lt;intent-filter&gt;   \n           &lt;action android:name=""android.intent.action.SEND"" /&gt;\n           &lt;category android:name=""android.intent.category.DEFAULT"" /&gt; \n           &lt;data android:mimeType=""image/*"" /&gt;\n       &lt;/intent-filter&gt;\n       &lt;intent-filter&gt;   \n           &lt;action android:name=""android.intent.action.SEND_MULTIPLE"" /&gt;\n           &lt;category android:name=""android.intent.category.DEFAULT"" /&gt; \n           &lt;data android:mimeType=""image/*"" /&gt;\n       &lt;/intent-filter&gt;\n   &lt;/activity&gt;\n', 'private List&lt;Uri&gt; parseIncomingData() {\n    List&lt;Uri&gt; uriList = null;\n\n    Intent intent = this.getIntent();\n    if(intent != null) {\n        String action = intent.getAction();\n        //Single Image\n        if (action.equalsIgnoreCase(""android.intent.action.SEND"")) {\n            //removed for brevity\n            }\n        }\n        //Multiple Images\n        else if (action.equalsIgnoreCase(""android.intent.action.SEND_MULTIPLE"")) {\n            uriList  = intent.getParcelableArrayListExtra(Intent.EXTRA_STREAM);\n        }\n    }\n\n    //more code - at this point images have been recieved\n\n    return uriList;\n}\n']",False

[NOTE: $KL(\hat{\mu}_n||\mu)$ means the KL-divergence between Bernoulli($\hat{\mu}_n$) and Bernoulli($\mu$).] One thing I know is that for Bernoulli, $KL(p||q) \geq 2(p-q)^2$, and hence, $$ P\left(\hat{\mu}_n - \mu &gt; c\right) \leq P\left(KL(\hat{\mu}_n || \mu) &gt; 2c^2\right), $$ but it doesn't help.

However, that solution won't suffice because it is not supported by IE &lt; 8 and still limited to 32K images in IE 8.

5086072,The difference between best practices and common sense?,"There is a lot of conversation regarding best practices1 in software development. I've seen at least three major points get a lot of discussion both on SE and elsewhere: What qualifies as a best practice, and why? Are best practices even worth discussing in the first place, because it's reasonable to assert that no practice is a ""best"" practice? When should you forego a best practice -- or perhaps most best practices -- either because it doesn't seem applicable or because of external constraints (time, money, etc.) that make the trade-off impractical? Something that seems to come up far less often, but more than never, is a notion of common sense in software development. Recent experience has brought this notion to the front of my mind again. My initial impression is that it is a different discussion than best practices, but with perhaps some cross-pollination. When I think of common sense in general, I think of a set of rules that you've either picked up or been taught that give you a baseline to reason and make decisions. Following common sense is a good way to avoid you shooting your entire leg off. But beyond a pretty low baseline, common sense gives way to a need to make educated decisions, and educated decisions can even override common sense when the evidence seems compelling enough. I might be playing a little loose with the definition here, but I think it is close enough to spearhead my example. When I think of common sense in software development, I think of all of the rules of basic hygiene to prevent a codebase from rapidly decaying into an incomprehensible mess. As examples, things like: not using a single global structure to maintain and communicate state within a non-trivial program; not using variables/method/class names that are just random gibberish; things that probably resemble what we've come to call anti-patterns quite closely. Where applying best practices the practical analogue to learning patterns, applying common sense could be seen as the practical analogue of learning anti-patterns. With this in mind, I'd like to pose a few questions that seeing the answers of others for might help me reason my way through this. Do others believe that there is a notion of common sense in software development? Would be interested knowing the reasoning either way. If so, is it a notion worth discussing? Is it something we should push for as much as we sometimes do with best practices? Is it something worth pushing for even harder? If the analogy to anti-patterns seems reasonable, the general rule is that anti-patterns are only employed if there is no other way, and even then only under very limited circumstances. How flexible should one be in allowing a codebase to deviate from common sense? It seems unreasonable that the answer is ""not at all,"" because sometimes expediency demands deviations. But, it seems like a different sort of argument than when to employ a ""best practice."" Maybe it isn't; if you don't think so, I'd like to learn why. This is far more opened ended and maybe worthy of a follow-on question all its own, what sorts of recommendations would you point at that seem like matters of common sense? Other thoughts are also welcome. 1Perhaps I would do better to call them ""commonly recurring domain patterns"", but the name ""best practices"" is common enough that everyone knows what they are, even if they don't agree that they are. If the ""best"" part bothers you, just imagine I replaced ""best practices"" with something less authoritative sounding.",[],False

The database will be hosted on a Windows Server 2008 box and will be used for both the stand-alone app and an associated website written in .NET. Some of my points of concern are: Cost (obviously PostgreSQL wins out here). Is it ready for primetime? I have read somethings about it being as good as SQL but would like some input from those using it. Ease of use. I am very comfortable with SQL Server. I have been experimenting with PostgreSQL and while it is different than SQL Server I am getting the hang of it. Speed. Is PostgreSQL as fast as SQL Server? Can I use ADO.NET (.NET 4.0) with PostgreSQL and get the same functionality as Using SQL Server (will be using Linq or Entity Framework)? I will NOT be converting our old database in SQL Server 8 to the new database so I am not concerned with any conversion.

Add additional details. For example, I get a curve in 2d space, and its polynomial is x: f(t) y: g(t) t is [0,1] So, if I want to get its monotonic curve segment, I must know the position of t where its tangent vector is (1,0). One direct way to resolve this is to setup an equation ""f'(x) = 0"". But I want to use the most efficient way to do this. For example, I try to use recursive ways to find this. Divide the range [0,1] to four parts, and check whether the four tangents projection on vector (1,0) are in same direction, and two points are close enough. If not, continue to divide the range into 4 parts, until they are in same direction in (1,0) and (0,1), and close enough.",[],False

Clearly some integers require fewer squares. Does there exist a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the minimum number of squares needed to sum to a given integer $n$? It is easy to come up with a dynamic program for this problem; denote the number of squares needed to represent $i$ by $T[i]$, then \begin{align*} T[i] = \min_{1 \le s \le \sqrt{i}} T[i - s^2] + 1 \end{align*} Thus, we can solve this problem in $\Theta(n\sqrt{n})$, but this is not polynomial in $\log(n)$.",[],False

The amount of data served seems to be correct, but I can't get the browser to display it (nor does it work if I download it as a file). I tried the following command: and sure enough, download.png was created and contained a snapshot of the google homepage, meaning that the wkhtmltoimage utility is working correctly, and the command works.

5310016,Accessing a GWT Servlet from a seperate GWT client,"I am using NetBeans for my IDE and GlassFish 3.1.2 for my server. I’ve written a trivial GWT project (GWTServer) which provides a GWT RPC Service named GWTService (all the service does is concatinate a string to what is passed in and return it). I have written a SEPERATE client project (GWTClient) that I want to access the server GWT RPC Service. NetBeans has generated some client code in GWTServer that can be used to access the RPC Service. My server GWT project is deployed on glassfish and accessable through “localhost:8080/GWTServer”. I am having problems doing a couple of things that I need to make this work: First, GWTServer has a couple of generated classes I need to use in GWTClient. These classes are GWTService and GWTServiceAsync. I need to (preferably) get the IDE to compile these into a jar file that I can include in GWTClient. I’ve tried creating a java library project, copying these 2 java files into the library and including that library in GWTClient but this gives me an error: “No source code is available for type org.gwtserver.client.GWTServiceAsync; did you forget to inherit a required module?” Secondly, somewhere in the client project I need to specify the url for the servlet (something like http://localhost:8080/GWTServer/ gwtservice). Basically, the environment needs to be set up such that when I call GWT.create(GWTService.class) it works. Presumably I can set up this connection in the .xml configuration files in the client project. But I have no idea how to do this.

5463204,Trouble defining multiple self-referencing foreign keys in a table,"I have some code here. I recently added this root_id parameter. The goal of that is to let me determine whether a File belongs to a particular Project without having to add a project_id FK into File (which would result in a model cycle.) Thus, I want to be able to compare Project.directory to File.root. If that is true, File belongs to Project. However, the File.root attribute is not being autogenerated for File. My understanding is that defining a FK foo_id into table Foo implicit creates a foo attribute to which you can assign a Foo object. Then, upon session flush, foo_id is properly set to the id of the assigned object. In the snippet below that is clearly being done for Project.directory, but why not for File.root?

But when I read some C code example using system call pipe() together with fork(), I wonder how to understand pipes, including both anonymous pipes and named pipes. It is often heard that ""everything in Linux/Unix is a file"". I wonder if a pipe is actually a file so that one part it connects writes to the pipe file, and the other part reads from the pipe file? If yes, where is the pipe file for an anonymous pipe created? In /tmp, /dev, or ...? However, from examples of named pipes, I also learned that using pipes has space and time performance advantage over explicitly using temporary files, probably because there are no files involved in implementation of pipes. Also pipes seem not store data as files do. So I doubt a pipe is actually a file.",[],False

There are several rows at the beginning for some miscellaneous information, and there are timestamps about every 6 lines.

The timestamp is predicatable, but there are some other random notes that can pop up that need to be ignored. They always start with several keywords that I can check for though. A sample of my file in the middle: From this I need to load information into three fields. The first field needs to be the filename, and the other are present in the example. I could add the filename to be in front of each data line, but this may not be necessary if I use a script to load the data.

Also, I'm confused about what they mean by the amount of hours for each dyno. http://www.heroku.com/pricing I also happened upon this article.

5614156,Convert String of ASCII digits to int in MIPS/Assembler,"Im writing some MIPS code to take a string of ASCII digits and convert the string into an integer. The string is entered by the user and can be at most 10 digits in length. My code works fine and uses the obvious method of performing looped addition after multiplying the Least Significant number in the string by a power of ten determined by the index of the array, starting from the last digit entered (10^0) to the first digit entered (10^n, n=number of digits in the array). I was wondering if there was an alternate method that would be quicker or shorter to write. In particular, I wanted to know if using a logical bit shift might make this process shorter. Any ideas for optimizing or improving this code would be greatly appreciated! Also, as a side note, I would like to call the gets and readInt subroutines using jal, but because gets and readInt both call subroutines, using jal in the main method to call gets or readInt causes problems. Any ideas how to get around this?

Certificates: I admit, that my knowledge about certificates are fairly basic - I'm working on that :). When ordering a SAN certificate from our provider does this certificate also have to include internal addresses or simply the external FQDNs? What I mean is, that I need to include the mail.contoso.com, autodiscover.contoso.com and legacy.contoso.com but beside that, do any internal names need to be included? And what about multiple TLD extensions - do these need to be accounted for in the SAN certificate as well? I think the above questions are what have been puzzling me the most. I'm eager for some feedback on this little project of mine and I appreciate any good advice :)",[],False

So, every 30 minutes I would get the new values from the database and update this variable. Eventual consistency between various servers is the only thing that's important - so if one server has a bit older value because the singleton timer is not synced that isn't an issue. I was thinking of spawning off a thread in the singleton constructor with a timer and updating the variable based on that timer. I'm not sure where in the application lifecycle a thread started from a singleton could be terminated. Is this the correct architectural approach to this?

This data is in an sqlite db in one table of approximately half a million records. I intend to display this data using the javascript chart library dygraph, I have already produced timeseries charts for each of these sensors individually by doing an sql query by sensor name and save to csv. I wish to have one chart which displays all the data points, with a line representing each sensor. I have created a numpy 2d array of type string called 'minutes_array' with the first column as unix timestamps rounded to the nearest minute covering every minute from the start of the sensor timeseries to the end with three empty columns to be filled with data from each of the 3 sensors where available. minutes_array The sensor timeseries data is then also rounded to the nearest minute and I use numpy.in1d and take the timestamps from the above 'minutes_array' and the 'sensor_data' array and create a mask for the records relating to that sensor. sensor_data I then wish to modify the records in minutes_array which are true for that mask and place the sensor_data value into the first column following the timestamp in minutes_array.

Highlighting the current page with and works perfect as long as its just on a normal page with children, however as soon as you visit a post from events or media, the blog link in the menu is highlighted instead which is incorrect obviously. *One thing noticeably wrong when looking at Wordpress' output is that the current page classes are not even being generated on the correct li tag that the post belongs to which seems to be the root of the problem.

Hightlighted in Grey is the incorrect li tag that wordpress has decided to add the current classes to instead. http://img688.imageshack.us/img688/4180/picture2zo.png EDIT - August 4, 2011 Maybe this will help demonstrate how I have the menu setup thus far a little better w/ Hadvig's assistance?
