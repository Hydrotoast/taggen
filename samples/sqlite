10650,Integrating Wicket and Enunciate,"I am now learning how to integrate wicket and enunciate by following this article http://docs.codehaus.org/display/ENUNCIATE/A+Rich+Web+service+API+for+Wicket. But the results is different from that site. The api folder was succesfully generated but when I pointed to the API in xml or json or rest or soap, I can't access them. Here are info I got when I tried to ""mvn:jetty-run"" in cmd : I think, there is something wrong with the enunciate I am trying to, but I don't know where I should check because if I think I have done what the codehaus tell me to do. Would you guide me to the right track ?

22535,What is the name of the developer package or Python runtime package in SuSE LES 11 SP1?,"_I had problem with installing the mod_wsgi.I have found the solution as below (I am quite sure this is the solution to my problem) in its website. However, I don't know the name of the developer package or Python runtime package in SuSE LES 11 SP1. Can any one tell me? Thank you_. In order to compile mod_wsgi from source code you must have installed the full Python distribution, including header files. On a Linux distribution where binary Python packages are split into a runtime package and a developer package, the developer package is often not installed by default. This means that you will be missing the header files required to compile mod_wsgi from source code. An example of the error messages you will see if the developer package is not installed are: To remedy the problem, install the developer package for Python corresponding to the Python runtime package you have installed. What the name of the developer package is can vary from one Linux distribution to another. Normally it has the same name as the Python runtime package with '-dev' appended to the package name. You will need to lookup up list of available packages in your packaging system to determine actual name of package to install","['mod_wsgi.c:113:20: error: Python.h: No such file or directory\nmod_wsgi.c:114:21: error: compile.h: No such file or directory\nmod_wsgi.c:115:18: error: node.h: No such file or directory\nmod_wsgi.c:116:20: error: osdefs.h: No such file or directory\nmod_wsgi.c:119:2: error: #error Sorry, mod_wsgi requires at least Python 2.3.0.\nmod_wsgi.c:123:2: error: #error Sorry, mod_wsgi requires that Python supporting thread.\n']",False

114335,"Existence of universal enveloping inverse semigroup (similar to ""Grothendieck group"")","Context In its simplest form, the Grothendieck group construction associates an abelian group to a commutative semigroup in a ""universal way"". Now I'm interested in the following nilpotent commutative semigroup $N$ consisting of two elements $a$ and $b$ such that $a^2=b^2=ab=ba=a$. The corresponding Grothendieck group is the trivial group with just one element, which is a bit boring. So I asked myself whether it would be possible to construct a ""universal enveloping inverse semigroup""(*) in a similar way as the Grothendieck group, and whether it would be more interesting. I tried to compute the ""universal enveloping inverse semigroup"" $N_I$ for the semigroup $N=\{a,b\}$. I got $N_I = \{ a, b, b^{-1}, bb^{-1}, b^{-1}b \}$ with $(b^{-1})^2=ab^{-1}=b^{-1}a=a$. What I find surprising is that $N_I$ is not commutative, even so $N$ is commutative. So I tried to compute the ""universal enveloping commutative inverse semigroup"" $N_C$ instead and got $N_C = \{ a \}$. (*)Note: In a semigroup $S$, we say that $y\in S$ is an inverse element of $x\in S$, if $xyx=x$ and $yxy=y$. A semigroup $S$ is called an inverse semigroup, if each $x\in S$ has a unique inverse element $x^{-1}\in S$. It's easy to see that $xx^{-1}$ and $x^{-1}x$ are idempotent, that all idempotent elements in an inverse semigroup commute, and that $(xy)^{-1}=y^{-1}x^{-1}$. So at least superficially, inverse semigroups seem to be nice generalization of groups and can have a zero element without being trivial. Question Does the ""universal enveloping inverse semigroup"" (and the ""universal enveloping commutative inverse semigroup"") of a semigroup $S$ always exist? I guess the answer is yes and this probably follows from some theorem of universal-algebra. Similarly, I guess that the ""universal enveloping regular semigroup"" doesn't always exist and wonder whether this also follows from some theorem of universal-algebra.",[],False

When you touch one tab it brings you to a new screen however the screen is made up of 2, or possibly more, fragments. The developer site showed me how to make each tab switch to a new fragment but what about when one tab has multiple fragments? At first I thought of nested fragments but that's not supported apparently. Am I overlooking something simple? Or is this not possible? I tried this solution: ActionBar Tabs with multiple fragments it sort of half-works but I'm having layout issues. To be honest I don't really understand how fragments and tabs interact with the XML layouts... Any advice or sample code would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Carl",[],False

In codeigniter, to include a file, codeIgniters very own load class is used. This load class, when loading a file, checks if a file have previously been included, and if not includes it, which ensures that a file isn't included twice. However this method of including files has the downside of making it impossible (?) to run tests on my files or take advantage of PHPdoc in my IDE, which I need.

And what databases make it simpler?,"I've been reading up a bit on how multi-tiered commenting systems are built: http://articles.sitepoint.com/article/hierarchical-data-database/2 I understand the two methods talked about in that article. In fact I went down the recursive path myself, and I can see how the ""Modified Preorder Tree Traversal"" method is very useful as well, but I have a few questions: How well do these two method perform in a large environment like Reddit's, where you can have thousands and thousands of mutli-tiered comments? Which method does Reddit use? It simply seems very costly, to me, to have to update thousands of rows if they use the MPTT method. I'm not deluding myself into thinking I am building a system to handle Reddit's traffic, this is simply curiosity. There's another way of retrieving comments like this ... JOINs via SQL that return the rows with IDs defining their parents. How much slower/faster/better/worse would it be to simply take these unformatted results, loop through them and add them into a formatted array using my language of choice (PHP)? After reading that sitepoint article, I believe I understand that Oracle offers this functionality in a much simpler, easier to use way, and MySQL does not. Are there any free databases that offer something similar to Oracle? On a side note, how is SQL pronounced? I'm getting the feeling I've been wrong for the past several years by saying 'sequel' instead of 's - q - l', although ""My Sequel"" rolls easier off the tongue than ""My S Q L""!",[],False

193018,How to show $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha^{4})=\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$?,"From Berkeley Problems in Mathematics, Spring 1999, Problem 17. Let $f(x)\in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ be an irreducible polynomial of degree $n\ge 3$. Let $L$ be the splitting field of $f$, and let $\alpha\in L$ be a zero of $f$. Give that $[L:\mathbb{Q}]=n!$, prove that $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha^{4})=\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$. (BELOW IS NONSENSE, SHOULD BE IGNORED) Following Gerry Myerson's advice, since $L$ is the splitting field of $f$, $L$ must be Galois over $\mathbb{Q}$. Thus the Galois group for $[L:\mathbb{Q}]=S_{n}$. Gerry now asserts that either $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha^{4})$ is of degree 2 over rationals or it must be $\mathbb{Q}$. But assuming this one can rule out the case $\mathbb{Q}$, since this would imply $\alpha$ is the root of a 4th or 2nd degree polynomial over $\mathbb{Q}$. But we know $n\ge 3$. So $\alpha$ must be the root of a 4th degree polynomial. We know $S_{n}$ has normal subgroups $A_{n}$ when $n\not=4$ and $V,A_{4}$ when $n=4$. I do not know how to proceed any further. Now assuming $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha^{4})$ is a degree 2 abelian extension over $\mathbb{Q}$. We should have a chain of normal extensions $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)\supset \mathbb{Q}(\alpha^{2})\supset \mathbb{Q}$. This would imply $S_{n}$ has a normal subgroup which has a normal subgroup. But we know $A_{n}$ for $n\ge 5$ are simple. So the only possibility is $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ has a Galois group isomorphic to $V$. In this case $n=4$ as well. I can only proceed to here.",[],False

281425,Unity 2 is behaving strangely with generics,"I am right now having big trouble with Unity 2 in my MVC 3 project. I have created an abstract BaseViewPage that all viewpages inherits from. In this i have 2 dependencies. So far so good. Now i have 3 different Viewpages that inherit from the BaseViewPage. These uses generics to deliver some specific data to the view. So far so good. Now comes the problem. In my homecontroller i use unity to resolve one of those viewpages. The viewpage gets loaded correctly when i debug it but right after my call to return view(""index"", model); unity makes a call to one of those dependencies inside the baseviewpage. This is done when the httpcontext is null. Unity config (Loads all the viewpages): BaseViewPage and one generic view page (the other generic pages looks almost the same): Now in my home controller i have first a dependency to Backend (to test that it works), then inside the Index i use unity to resolve one generic view page: Now after the return, unity makes a call to the BackendWrapper object. More precisely BackendWrapper.UserIdent.TheLogin. TheLogin throws an error since there is no HttpContext present. Question is, why does unity try to access it? I have implemented a dispose inside the BackendWrapper and inside the UserIdent but unity ignores them and still calls TheLogin. Inside the BackendWrapper i have a constructor that calls an external dll to create a new UserIdent. So its nothing that Unity is resolving. But unity still tries to access it. Also, if i remove the dependency from the BaseViewPage it works perfectly. So only when BaseViewPage has a dependency to BackendWrapper is this problem occurring.

285218,Drawing with Quartz 2D on top of EAGLLayer possible?,"In my app, I have an equalizer with a visualizer behind it. The equalizer is a series of dots which are imageviews with a path drawn between them using Quartz 2D (also with tick marks on the bottom and left to denote the frequency and gain amounts). Behind that is a visualizer done using OpenGL with a CAEAGLLayer. The way this is set up is there is a sub view of my view controller's main view that handles the visualizer, and above that is another subview of the main view that draws the path. Above both of them are the image views for the eq points. What happens is, the path draws fine until a song starts and the visualizer starts to draw. It seems like it wipes out the Quartz 2D above it. Even having it call setNeedsDisplay on the view above it every time it draws is not working. Like OpenGL is given exclusive access to draw there. The UIImageView eq points however, stay visible. Is there any way to use Quartz 2D on top of a view with a gl layer? I'd prefer not to use OpenGL to draw the path and tick marks using OpenGL because I would have to draw to either a 512x512 or 1024x1024 texture and scale it, so it would not look perfect, and I've already got the working Quartz code to draw everything.",[],False

I've searched for how to do this but what i find (even on here) says exactly what I'm doing. So I'm not sure what's wrong. here's my code for the windows phone: the last line calls the add method in my wcf service which looks like: It's good to note that it doesn't matter if I use the passed in array directly or if I turn it into text, they both show up the same in the database. Then finally, in the app this is sending everything to, I have this: but it always breaks on ""var image = Image.FromStream(new MemoryStream(g));"" saying the parameter is not valid. I found out it has a big array once it gets the image but the one in the database is only 65 bytes and they all say 57.

388468,Legal ramifications of use of the JavaScript trademark?,"It's widely known that the name ""JavaScript"" is trademarked by Oracle (formerly a trademark of Sun, formerly a trademark of Netscape). However, others seem to have no problem using the JavaScript trademark. Google uses it in reference to V8, Mozilla uses it in reference to SpiderMonkey and in various other places, etc. Mozilla is the only one that seems to try to attribute the trademark to its owner (bottom of this page), although at the time of this writing it's incorrectly attributed to Sun rather than Oracle. For a long time, Microsoft used ""JScript"" as the name of their ECMAScript implementation rather than ""JavaScript,"" presumably to avoid infringing on the trademark. Recently (I'm not sure when), Microsoft appears to have switched from the ""JScript"" name to ""JavaScript."" My understanding based on the version history is that they've written a new ECMAScript implementation and named it ""JavaScript,"" leaving the old one named ""JScript"" (rather than retroactively renaming ""JScript"" to ""JavaScript""). My question is this: Since JavaScript is trademarked, isn't it an infringement to use it in connection with the name of a product or technology (such as ""Microsoft JavaScript"") without permission? If so, where can I find records of agreements with Oracle/Sun/Netscape allowing third-party use of the trademark? I assume these documents would be publicly listed somewhere, but I don't know where to find them. And finally, if the trademark changes hands again, would previously-made agreements still be valid, or would they need to be re-forged with the current trademark holder? The reason I ask is because I want to know whether I can use the word ""JavaScript"" in the title of a product, for example a JavaScript library, without explicit permission, and whether I need to provide a disclaimer stating that JavaScript is Oracle's trademark.",[],False

It can take stereoscopic photos, albeit with a low-res and noisy sensor. I'm not expecting great photos, however, I am seeing one issue I can't explain simply by cheap sensors. In some lighting conditions, when I take a picture, one of the pictures turns out much darker than the other. It's not predictable whether it's the left or right camera, but it's often one of them. The only thing I can think of is that it it's related to fluorescent lighting - that it takes the photos serially and one of them takes place just late enough that the bulb has done a half-cycle, resulting it in being either lighter or darker, and then it doesn't do separate color-correction. In my test cases it has never happened under incandescents or the sun, but happens regularly - but not always - under fluorescents. (However, the sample size is biased because we only have one incandescent light in our apartment.) But I know jack about cameras and lighting. Does this explanation sound reasonable?

Web pages open fine in Firefox, but in Internet Explorer, they open painfully slow... they'll load most of the page but then hang up on something, ...

This does not happen under the Administrator account (everything works fine under that one), but seems to happen under all other accounts. I have tried resetting IE to defaults making the other account an administrative account instead of standard upgrading to the IE10 customer preview (it was IE9) updating the graphics drivers switching network adapters manually disabling all addons through the Manage Addons menu I even tried creating a completely brand new user account on the system, and the same thing happens under that one.

672689,break out of e2fsck on boot,"Is it possible to somehow break out of e2fsck on boot? My system runs e2fsck every 30 days, which is fine by me and I want it to stay that way. But sometimes when I turn on the computer and 30 days have passed, I still want it to boot fast. For instance when I have to give a presentation off a laptop - imagine telling 50 people ""we just have to wait for 10 minutes... no, I can't avoid it... yes, this is Linux, why are you asking?"" :) If I press Ctrl+C it stops the check and continues boot sequence, but the system is unusable because root filesystem is mounted read-only. And after I reboot the check starts again. I have searched the Internet for the answer and there are many similar questions, but I could find no solution. Anyone know of a solution? Note: I am looking for a solution that would not disable fsck and that would not require any action before rebooting the computer - I do not know in advance I will have to skip the check. If it matters: Debian 6 (Squeeze).\ UPDATE: I learned that it is possible to break out of e2fsck with Esc key on Ubuntu. This is exactly what I am looking for - anyone know how to make this happen on Debian?",[],False

The application makes use of an external COM object (in-process dll). It will create an instance of that object during the login phase and store it as a session variable. This used to work quite nice and worked well in my test but when I deployed it on the first production server, I started to have random ""500"" errors when users tried to log in. The error was really not consistent so I used procmon to trace the source of the problem and got this: when a user tries to access the web site, the IIS worker process tries to open the Dll that hosts the COM object but fails with an access denied error. Now, I don't understand this: the web application uses a service account for accessing the local resources. That service account has explicit rights on the directory where that COM library is located. Yet, the access to that file is still denied. I ""fixed"" the issue by giving ""everyone"" explicit read and execute access on the dll and it (seems to) have solved the problem. But I don't know why. The strangest thing is that is I use a local administrator account to connect to the web page once (and just once), then the issue was fixed for as long as the application wasn't recycled. I would appreciate if anyone could shed some light on that issue. I can live with the fix, but I really would like to understand. Edit To clarify: the web site is NOT set to impersonate the connecting user. In fact, the only authentication scheme enabled is ""Anonymous Authentication"". The basic settings, however, are set to use the service account. Edit The identity reported by procmon during the access denied is ""IIS APPPOOL\(application name)""",[],False

Can someone clarify usage and best practices regarding how to get around this problem?","['   function TestObject() {\n            TestObject.prototype.firstMethod = function(){\n                      this.callback();\n                      YAHOO.util.Connect.asyncRequest(method, uri, callBack);\n\n            }\n\n            TestObject.prototype.callBack = function(o){\n              // do something with ""this""\n              //when method is called directly, ""this"" resolves to the current object\n              //when invoked by the asyncRequest callback, ""this"" is not the current object\n              //what design patterns can make this consistent?\n              this.secondMethod();\n            }\n            TestObject.prototype.secondMethod = function() {\n             alert(\'test\');\n            }\n        }\n']",False
931194,Changing class of same id,"I'm looking for a method to change the class of the same id's. I have a table with multiple rows and some parent-child 'rows'. Thus when clicked on the parent, the class of the child has to change aswell. I have the following code: This script is called by: and each parent has a new ID (so parent + child carry the same ID).

However, I want to know what ""default"" settings I can use for shooting pageants, float parades etc where the subject can bypass me quickly (ramp models can walk past me before I get a good shot, etc. I tried using Manual to shoot but it takes too long to adjust both shutter speed and aperture especially if the lighting can change quickly. I tried Aperture and Shutter Speed priority but they produce mostly overexposed shots at most times especially when the lighting is quite strong. Auto mode is out of the question but I tried it and it is more unreliable, often giving me slow shutter speeds. What can I do about this? EDIT: I am using a Nikon D7000 with an 80-200 AF lens.

975374,Feature or bug? 3D perspective in Flash Player 10 changes as objects are added to the stage,"In my AS3/Flash Player 10 app, I've got a movieclip on the stage with its own properties configured; in particular, I'm explicitly setting its so that it has its own vanishing point (see this question for details). I'm adding functionality to my application so that if a user clicks one of the buttons around the transformed movieclip, a lightbox-style layer appears over the 3D-transformed movieclip. The problem I'm having is that when the lightbox layer appears, there's a perceptible shift in the location/transformation of the transformed movieclip, and when the lightbox layer is removed, the transformed movieclip returns to its original location. Stranger still, this effect only happens about half the time; usually, the first couple of lightbox invocations have no effect, but the third or fourth causes the 3D movieclip to jump around. There's no 3D elements that are part of the lighbox (i.e. no z-indices are being explicitly set), and I can't find documentation of this phenomenon anywhere else. Is this a bug in FP 10? If it is, the only workaround I can think of is taking a snapshot of the 3D-transformed movieclip as and showing that in place of the 3D mc whenever the lightbox appears, but that seems inefficient and brutally hackish. Any thoughts?","['transform.perspectiveProjection', 'projectionCenter', 'bitmapData']",False

My (practice) system contains a mysql table of movies. This list was sourced from an Excel sheet, which was exported as CSV, and imported via phpMyAdmin. I noticed that titles with more ""exotic"" glyphs have issues rendering in the browser, eg The é in Amélie. Using Cake or plain PHP, it renders as a , unless transformed via into a . Links with the special characters don't render at all. If I use my Cake input form to enter an , this is rendered correctly in source, but as via . After a quick SO search, I decided maybe UTF-8 would fix stuff, hence I changed the PHP source, and CSV file encoding to UTF-8 made sure the stuff was there (it was already via Cake's default layout). made sure my browsers thinks the doc is UTF-8 (they do) changed the collation on the MySQL DB to utf-8 general_ci (as an educated stab from avalable UTF-8 options) deleted and reimported my data However, I'm still stuck. I note that phpMyAdmin manages to render the characters ""correctly"" in it's HTML source when browsing records. I sense that document encoding's to blame, however, am wondering if someone can provide the best answer to: what's the best way to move my data from Excel to MySQL to preserve glyphs? what's the optimum settings for my tables to accommodate this?

To be specific, let $$f_n(x) = \frac{nx - \lfloor nx\rfloor}{n}$$ Then define $$F(x) = \lim_{n\to\infty}f_n(x)$$ It seems intuitively clear that $F(x) = 0$ for all $x$ because the global maximum of $f_n$ is $\frac{1}{n}$. If $F(x) = 0$, then we should have $F&#39;(x) = 0$ as well. However, if we choose an irrational value of $x$, then $f&#39;_n(x) = 1$ for all $n$, so if $F&#39;(x)$ is found instead by taking $$F&#39;(x) = \lim_{n\to\infty}f&#39;_n(x)$$ we do not get $F&#39;(x) = 0$.

The WSDL is fine because I already use it for my IPhone App and now I'm doing the Android version of it. It's something related with android connectivity and KSOAP since when I do my testings without Android everything works like a charm! Any idea would help, thanks :)",['_httpsTransport.reset();\n_httpsTransport.getConnection().disconnect();   \n'],False
1061026,AChartEngine Pie Chart View not displaying,"UPDATE: All done! The LinearLayout needed an actual height and width to it. I'm sure I shouldn't need to add them but at least it gives me something to work with. Ta. I would have self answered this but I haven't got enough of a reputation apparently and need to wait 8 hours. I had spent days trying to sort this out, post the question and work it out in 2 hours. Soz. I think I am doing something wrong. I have looked at some examples and thought I was doing pretty much the same thing - but clearly not. UPDATE: Should have pointed out, I am using the aChartEngine graphing library to add a PieChartView to a LinearLayout I have a method which is called in onCreate() like so and then in onResume() This is my xml layout The outcome is that the chart is not displaying.

1139956,"Why does Silverlight claim that font height is in pixels, when IT'S NOT?","All of the documentation I can find, and every search I do, keeps coming back with the assertion that in Silverlight, when you set a FontHeight it's a height in pixels, and likewise for LineHeight, in e.g. a TextBlock. But in practice that isn't true at all: when I set a font height (and line height) of 22 with a common font like Lucida Sans Unicode, the actual height between lines is 33 pixels. (Actually, 33 and a fraction.) To work around this, I tried doing what I had done in Java applets: use font metrics to ask how tall my text actually is. The only way to do this that I found is to render the sample text into an offscreen TextBlock, Measure it, and see how tall it ends up. It returned a very handy answer: 32 pixels. Note that this is ALMOST correct. The onscreen TextBlock rendered the font 33 pixels high, and the offscreen one rendered it 32 pixels high. The only way to measure my text accurately turned out to be to put the ""offscreen"" block onscreen, transparent and behind the real onscreen one. Then the measurement returns 33. What am I missing here? Why does everybody say the height is in pixels, but I find that the number here represents an actual height measured in pixel-and-a-halfs, and furthermore the exact ratio varies depending on whether the control is part of the active page or is detached and self-sufficient? What am I not understanding?? Added note: I am aware of the difference between the height occupied by a row of text and the height of the actual glyphs. But the same documentation that says the font height is in pixels also says that the line height is in pixels, and defaults to being the same as the font height. This clearly implies that the font height is supposed to include all vertical space used, not just the glyph heights. Final note: I think my problem in the end is that I keep running into misinformation about silverlight, and then forgetting where I read it, so I get it mixed up with the accurate information. Like, where was it that I read that Canvas stretches to hold its content? It doesn't.",[],False

Now map $n$ to the point $n \mapsto (e_1,e_2,\ldots,e_i,0,\ldots)$, where $i$ is the last prime in the factorization of $n$. For example, $$n=123456789 \mapsto (0,2,\ldots,1,\ldots,1,\ldots)$$ because $123456789=2^0 3^2 \cdots 3607^1 \cdots 3803^1$. So every number in $\mathbb{N}$ is mapped to a point in an arbitrarily high dimensional space. This mapping has the property that addition of the vectors corresponds to multiplication of the numbers. My (extremely vague!) question is: Does this viewpoint helps gain any insights into the structure/properties of natural numbers? Do line/planes/curves in this space mark out numerically interesting regions? Perhaps allowing real or complex numbers? The numbers in $\mathbb{N}$ fill this infinite-dimensional space very sparsely.

1231219,SharePoint 2010: How Can I Access Any List from a Custom Timer Job?,"I am developing a SharePoint 2010 timer job in C# which updates employee status (whether they are currently available or away from work) information retrieved from an SQL database to be updated and stored in an Employees SharePoint list (the desired approach is to be able to access any list I chose, not just one specified/hard coded list). I created a SharePoint empty project whose sole feature is the timer job with my event receiver class with custom code in the FeatureActivated and FeatureDeactived methods. The timer job class's Execute method gets the data using SqlClient and stores it into a dictionary object whose key value is the Employee ID and whose value is the status. The dictionary is then used to retrieve the employee records in the Employees SharePoint list and update the status. My problem is, no matter what scope I have chosen for the timer job, I cannot access any SharePoint list I desire. I have tried to hard code in URLs for the lists, using the SPWeb and SPSite, just about anything. I have checked the sitecollection for my site, and I have 2 site collections (""/"", ""testsitecollection""), and the second one is not used at all. For example"" SPWeb web = site.OpenWeb(); SPList list = web.Lists[""Employees""]; An exception is thrown: ""List ""Employees"" cannot be found at http://www.mysite"" I was wondering if anyone had any input on the matter. In terms of source code, I followed the many examples on the web such as this: http://www.andrewconnell.com/blog/articles/CreatingCustomSharePointTimerJobs.aspx All of the examples I found on the web for custom timer jobs update lists on the front site such as the Tasks list.

Right now I have always hosted applications on RackSpace Cloud and I have no issues with them at all - always been a really good service and never had any downtime. My question is though does anyone think that cloud computing is not the way to host scalable web apps? Or can anyone with experience of this recommend a better solution. I have always shunned trying to run big servers from my own facilities as I think it seems silly to go to the expense of bringing in big alternative power supplies and all the other necessary precautions when other companies already do this. I looked at managed hosting services but this proved to be a bit too expensive for us at the start and the scalability of it wasnt good enough - it would take a day or two to get a new server provisioned.

Now normally this makes sense, but it takes about 30 seconds for a 167 kB file. Now I'm not sure what to do. It runs incredibly slow/stops functioning when you load a textfile and try to resize the window containing the text file too. Then I realized that it is only struggling to open text files with a long string of hex inside (ie) ""XX-XX-XX-"" etc. With other similarly sized files it struggles with resizing somewhat, but opens within a couple seconds. Does this have something to do with the textbox properties? I've set it to multiline and set maximum characters to 0 (so unlimited). How do I solve this issue?

The idea is to have a textarea with div elements absolutely positioned above, so it looks like they are in text area. It was pain so far, but I managed to do pretty much everything, except one thing. Is it even possible in javascript to set reverse-selection? When you put a cursor somewhere in the middle of textarea, hold down shift and press left arrow a few times, you'll get a selection. The tricky part, is that it's not usual - it's backwards (it's start is to the right from the end, not like it is usually). There are placeholders in my textarea over which I display my divs (tokens). When you navigate to one of them, cursor jumps to the opposite edge of a placeholder, so it feels natural. When you hold down shift, and reach the placeholder, it jumps to the right, and it sets a new selection, so it looks like you selected the token (you can press delete, and remove selected range with token itself, which is cool). BUT it wont possibly work if you navigate from right to left, because setting a new selection would make it unreverted one: Left-to-right selection: Right-to-left selection So here's question: Can I set a selection in textarea where start point would be greater than the end point?

1394835,Calculating the maximum size of derived classes,"We have a My_list class that has a list of pointers to Abstract_things. To optimize on memory usage, all derived Things use one memory pool that is established with the ""new and delete"" stereotype. In order to size the pool properly during the initization of the application, the builder figures out which Thing is the biggest and sizes the pool based on that. The design dilemma is that if a new Thing is added to the model, (represented with the red Thing_4), the designer has to know to go over to Builder to adjust the logic. I have observed that it was hard enough for our team to remember to do this (about half our Things weren’t considered in the Builder). I’m very concerned that future generations will overlook this. My question is how can I improve this? It would be wonderful if in the act of creating a Thing_4 class, all that max_size stuff automagically got handled. I can’t think of a way though. Note: Reviewing my picture I realize there's a mistake. The last line in the code-box should read Abstract_thing::set_max_pool_size(max_size, max_number). Edit: I can't figure out how to display a picture. Everything looks good in the preview window, but when published it's not there. Any help? Edit: To give a little bit more background, this is part of a design for an embedded application in a safety-critical system. We are allowed to allocate memory off the heap when the application is initializing, but after we exit that initialization phase, NO dynamic memory can be allocated. Attempting to do so crashes the application. Therefore, we program to the largest sizes and the maximum number of instances we use. Having one pool that contains enough space for all derived objects is the better approach over having a pool for each derived object.",[],False

1423107,Binding KnockoutJS to Radio Button with computed,"I have a question with an array of answers. Each answer has a boolean property called isRight, which represents whether the answer is...right. I'm trying to render a radio button for each answer, and have it be checked if that answer is right. If the user clicks a different button, that answer becomes correct. I understand that KO binds the checked property to a value, and each radio button will only be checked if the radio's value matches the bound value; you can't just bind directly to isRight. I put a computedObservable on the question itself, which should do all that. And it works. The problem is, I want to subscribe to the change event of the radio button, to see when a new answer is selected (and send an ajax request). The problem I'm having is that the ko binding is not updated in the change handler. It seems putting a delay in the handler will give me what I want, but I'd prefer a more direct solution. And it seems the click event works perfectly, but that'll fire each time a radio button is clicked, even if it's already checked.

As far as I know, striping is used in several storage situations to speed up transfer rates: multiple hdd's in one computer, chips inside of ssd's, dual/triple channel memory, and probably more, that I don't know. Harddisks ususally have a number of platters inside. Usually 1 to 5. Sometimes they're used on both sides, which means there are up to 10 heads inside the hdd. But no matter what number of platters is inside, the transfer rates of harddisks is the same. Why? The fact, that the heads and platters always share the same position does not count for me.

1524202,Most reliable data storage on hard drives,"Is there any hard drive storage technology that checks data integrity upon read? RAID stores the data redundantly (i.e. writes several copies of the data on several drives) but I believe that it only reads the data from one drive most of the time. So if one drive gets corrupted somehow and it happens to be the drive use by a read operation, one could read corrupted data unknowingly. Assuming that you regularly resync your RAID array, you might detect the discrepancy but it may be too late. And resolving the conflicting data might not be trivial. Imagine you have two drives in a RAID 1 configuration for example. How can you tell with certainty which drive is right if the two drives disagree? I see a fairly straight-forward solution. Let's say that you have some sort of RAID 1 with three identical drives. If you write everything to the three drives, when it comes the time to read the data, you could query all three drives and if they all agree, everything is fine. If one drive disagrees with the other two, you try to correct it (e.g. you write and read the data again). If that fails, you could mark the sector as bad and/or raise an error to the OS. Anyway you have a pretty good chance that you can trust the data on which two of the drives agreed. I don't think this can be done with RAID? Am I correct? If so, can it be done another way or is there another solution? Thanks for sharing, LP",[],False

1524700,Simple? argv[] conversion to char*,"So I have a sample application source I am trying to modify for my own purposes it basically is running a shell script (test example below) but with privs using apple's security framework (see link below for original source). In that sample code we pass the following: I have modified the command to add myToolPath as the first argument as so: which works, it means when I run It returns ""root"" rather then the user I am using. But now I want to be able to pass arguments to this helper and have them added to this array This is what the example does in the sample code So my previous shell example would have output like this: but I would like to be able to dynamically pass as many arguments as argv can contain to this script so the output would look like this I don't need to handle the arguments in the C code, I just need them to be passed directly to the shell script ( external command ). So heres my (hopefully) simple question, if one wanted to take argv[] and copy it except for argument 0 (which is the path to ./compiled_priv) to something expecting the char * myArguments var what would that look like in code. I learned objective C and never started with C so this is probably pretty basic but I have tried a for loop and copying the two indexes, but its not working. something like: char *myArguments[] = argv is what i want but that does not work, as it says invalid initializer, and even if it did it looks like we need a NULL at the end of the array much like a NSTask. I would include my for loop but its a non starter. So I need to the contents of argv from 1 to the end of the array and to add a NULL to the end and wrap that up in the same form as char *myArguments[] in the original sample code. If I understood c better it would help but in the mean time any thoughts?

1527787,"Remove ""Flash"" between pages while using Internet Explorer modal boxes","I have an internal web application, that is IE specific, and uses a lot of IE specific modal boxes: (window.showModalDialog). I recently received a request to remove the ""flash"" when navigating between pages of the site. To accomplish this, I just added a meta transition tag to my master page: This works perfectly except for the modal boxes. When you launch a modal box, and then move it around, the web page behind it keeps a trail of the modal box instead of re-drawing the web page content. This prevents the user from moving the modal box to read anything that was behind it. Is there a way to prevent the ""flash"" between pages in an IE specific site and have the site still work with modal boxes? Please note, this is a large and complex site, so re-architecting it to not use modal boxes isn't an option. This is an asp.net, c# web application, and all of my users are using IE 7 and IE 8 if it makes any difference. -Edit- To duplicate this, put the following into an html page, and open it in Internet Explorer:","['&lt;meta http-equiv=""Page-Enter"" content=""blendTrans(duration=0.0)"" /&gt;\n', '&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Test&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;meta content=""blendTrans(duration=0.0)"" http-equiv=""Page-Exit""&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n&lt;script language=""javascript""&gt;\n    window.showModalDialog(\'modal.htm\', window);\n&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n']",False

1640821,Shared storage solution for our sql server backups,"We have 3 clustered sql servers. We have 5+ multi terrabyte databases and their backup files (compressed using quest litespeed) are hitting over 600gb each, We are required to keep at least a week or two weeks (if we can) of weekly full backups and then 6 days differential backups, and a week or 2 weeks worth of log backups local. We are currently limited to 2TB volumes from our san team, we can have multiple volumes but they are expensive ($200 per raw TB per month) and having to deal with many backup volumes instead of a single big volume is difficult. I think if we could have a shared network storage of 20TB+ raid 10 or so for all our servers for keeping the backups and another department will copy them to tape from the network storage and delete files according to the retention period would be good, if this box would be a build in operating system (even unix a complete file storage system) that would be good.

1673092,PHP preg_replace Expertise Sought,"I'm creating some custom BBcode for a forum. I'm trying to get the regular expression right, but it has been eluding me for two days. Any expert advice is welcome. The input (e.g. sample forum post): [quote=Bob]I like Candace. She is nice.[/quote] I agree, she is very nice. I like Ashley, too, and especially [Ryan] when he's drinking. Essentially, I want to encase any names (from a specified list) in [user][/user] BBcode... except, of course, those being quoted, because doing that causes some terrible parsing errors. Below is an example of how I want the output to be. The desired output: [quote=Bob]I like [user]Candace[/user]. She is nice.[/quote] I agree, she is very nice.

How can I achieve the results I want? I don't want the regex to match when a name is preceded by an equals sign (=), but putting a [^=] in front of the names in the regex will make it match any non-equals sign character (i.e. spaces), which then messes up the formatting. Update The problem is that by using \1 instead of \0 it is omitting the first character before the names (because anything but = is matched).

2011519,How to map different many to manys with same constraint,"I have a data model that i have some concerns over. Here it is: My concern is that it's possible to assign an application to a member, and then assign a role that is from a different application to the member. Now, I know I can put a constraint on this to ensure that doesn't happen, but that seems like a bandaid. I would rather design the model so that a constraint was not required. Can anyone suggest how to alter the model to ensure that a member can only be assigned roles from an application it is assigned to?",[],False

2041705,Gradual Disk Errors,"I am having an intermittent problem with my computer where programs start freezing up. What generally happens is that certain programs stop responding entirely, and are impossible to kill via the task manager (almost always iTunes and my backup program). Eventually, I'm forced to reboot. Inevitably, when I reboot, my RAID 1 array goes into a verification scan, finding and repairing errors along the way. Because the programs that lock up are those that read large parts of the disk and the RAID repair after reboot, I'm inclined to think that one of the drives in the array has errors that develop slowly over time. Any ideas as to how I might diagnose which drive and whether I need to just replace the drive entirely? Could it be the RAID card instead? Has anyone seen similar problems with a RAID array and iTunes locking up? EDIT: The raid controller is an Intel ICH8R/ICH9R/ICH10R/DO SATA RAID Controller. I don't think that's the product name, but it's all the info I can glean from the device manager. Update Since I asked this question, I stopped using the RAID 1 array and upgraded to a new, single drive. I still see the same sort of degradation after a couple weeks of uptime, but now when I reboot, instead of rebuilding the array, the OS forces a check-disk, where it often finds a couple of errors, fixes them with no problem, and then continues booting.

I was under the impression there was stuff in the C++ standard library (or less desirably, in Boost), that allowed you to ""tweak"" properties of types, with finer granularity than say or .","['template &lt;typename P&gt;\nvoid Q void_cast(P Q *p) const\n{\n    return static_cast&lt;P Q *&gt;(p);\n}\n', 'void', 'const', 'restrict', 'Q', 'const_cast', 'static_cast']",False
2095564,Would adding award points or game features to workplace software be viewed poorly amongst the programming community?,"So one of my responsibilities at work is to build an internal tool that helps the workers enter in all their information. It's an enterprise application that is similar to a Windows forms database tool. So it's not much different than like developing a Word + Excel combo application, but the average person in this workgroup is a 20-40 year old woman or a random chatty male type. Plus I know all of these people are heavily involved with Facebook on a daily basis. How bad would it be if I styled my new interface to be similar to what Facebook does. People could get award points and stuff when they fill out different types of forms and basically compete against each other like it was a game. When people had completed one, it would be posted on their wall and everyone could comment/like stuff just like in Facebook. And it would be like they are doing peer reviewing for fun. The rewards would be outstanding I would imagine. These people are so into Facebook and Facebook games that productivity would rise due to them trying to compete and earn points and achievements. Would this be taking advantage of the people by 'tricking them into working harder by giving them a game' or would it be viewed as something that would improve happiness at work?",[],False
2102225,IoC container object scoping,"I am interested in implementing an IoC container in my project but I haven't seen an example out there that does what I need. Here is the situation, my application is built in WPF and uses the MVVM pattern to create a player for an infrared video format. In this format, each video is actually made up of multiple ""subframes"" (think of it as capturing at multiple shutter speeds simultaneously in order to increase the dynamic range of the data) that are each displayed in a TabControl. I would like to use an IoC container to help me create the ViewModels for each of the tabs, but I have two concerns. I need a way to pass in the object that represents the subframe I'm creating a ViewModel for so at least one of the ViewModel's dependencies can't be created by the IoC container because it already exists. I have user controls inside the view for a subframe that have their own ViewModels so those ViewModels need to be created by the IoC container as well. The problem with this is that while the controls (and their ViewModels) have separate concerns, they are not completely indpendent so they use some coordination objects. Unfortunately in all the examples I've seen you can either have your IoC container create a new instance of a dependency or have a singleton, but what I need is a single instance during the controlled scope of time when I'm creating the subframe ViewModel. That's a lot of text so here's some code that shows what I'm doing and what I'd like to do. What I have now In the open a movie code: In the SubframeViewModel: What I would like to have without changing the existing sematics In the open a movie code: In the SubframeViewModel: In reality, there are more coordination and ViewModel objects involved but the patterns are the same. That said, I think you can see why I'm interested in an IoC container here. I think my scenario should be rather common but I'm not sure and I don't want to waste my time trying to fit a square peg into a round hole so here are my questions. Can any / all IoC containers do this? If not, can you point me towards a refactoring that would improve my code and make IoC work?","['foreach (var subframe in movieFile)\n{\n    // Subframes is the ObservableCollection that the TabControl is bound to\n    Subframes.Add(new SubframeViewModel(subframe));\n}\n', 'public SubframeViewModel(ISubframe subframe)\n{\n    _subframe = subframe;\n\n    // FrameController tracks the current frame number and fires an event \n    // when it changes\n    var frameController = new FrameController(subframe); \n\n    // ImageViewModel represents the actual movie image.

2117168,Could different brands of memory be incompatible even if they have identical specs?,"I've recently assembled a PC with two different brands of memory with identical timings (9-9-9-24) and speed (1333 MHz). My motherboard, an Asus P8Z68-V, has independent memory channels, leading me to believe that identical timings shouldn't even be an issue. However, my system is very unstable. Sometimes it fails to POST after hibernating. Other times it crashes in applications under Ubuntu 12.04. Ubuntu frequently reports errors related to the video card, which is internal to the Intel 3770 CPU. For example, Firefox just reported FramePoisonBase: 7ffffffff0dea000 InstallTime: 1347398395 Notes: OpenGL: Tungsten Graphics, Inc -- Mesa DRI Intel(R) Ivybridge Desktop -- 3.0 Mesa 8.0.2 -- texture_from_pixmap FramePoisonSize: 4096 It worked reliably with only one pair and brand of memory. The problem started one week after I installed the second pair and brand. (For the first week it was fine.) Interestingly, this is the second pair of the second brand I've been through--the first pair had a faulty stick. I'm not sure whether the problem is with the memory itself, an incompatibility, the motherboard's hardware, its configuration, or even the CPU. I have not overclocked anything. I've run memory tests all night without finding a single error. What steps should I follow to troubleshoot the error? edit: The BIOS was misconfigured for some reason. I fixed it and it worked fine for the rest of the day. Then I hibernated for the night and it failed to POST in the morning. I had to remove and re-insert a stick (I chose one of the new ones) to get it to work. Could a software bug be responsible for this or does it necessarily indicate that something is still wrong with the hardware?",[],False

2307176,Reduce allocation sorting large list (or vector),"I am trying to reduce GC time in my program. The main suspect is the following piece of code: The list being sorted would typically contain several thousand elements.

Perhaps I'm doing it wrong, but what I'm seeing is that there is no allocation (productivity 97% as opposed to 63% with lists), but the program is many times slower: it runs in 85 seconds with List.sortBy; with inplace sort I killed it after waiting 7 minutes.

2493253,JQuery Object Design,"This is my current flow of JQuery: Object is created. Object has a function called draw() which returns a string containing its HTML representation. Container is created. Container also has a function draw() which does the same thing. Both the Object and Container are drawn to two separate divs using $('.class').append(...). Object's div is made draggable, and Container's div is made droppable. The above works. But the following is where I stumble: The Container container contains an array of Objects. When a user drops an Object div onto the Container div, I want to add that Object into the Container array. Is my only option to add a unique ID to each Object, create the Object div with that ID, drop the Object onto the Container div with a unique Container ID, and then perform a lookup on both of the IDs? EDIT: Ok, maybe I can abstract it a little bit better. I have trading cards and card packs on the screen. The trading cards are little square boxes with a picture of the monster, and the card packs are small grey boxes. When you drop a trading card onto the card pack, the trading card disappears and inside the card pack a small image of the trading card is placed. So each card pack has a container of trading cards. Each object TradingCard and CardPack has a .draw() method that creates a string of HTML representing how that object is drawn. Then you can append that string to any object on the screen using JQuery. Now, relating back to my initial post: The TradingCard is draggable, and the CardPack is droppable. When a TradingCard is dropped onto a CardPack, a function inside JQuery's droppable is called. I want that function to add that TradingCard to the CardPack's array.",[],False

2533612,The center of a simply connected semisimple Lie group,"I am learning about Lie groups, and I have the following basic question: Every Lie group $G$ has a (unique) universal covering group $ \bar G $ that is simply connected, and such that the covering map $ p : \bar G \to G $ is a homomorphism. It follows that $\pi _1 ( G ) = \mathrm {ker} (p) \le \bar G $ is a normal discrete subgroup, and hence central. Using the above one can show that all Lie groups with some fixed Lie algebra $ \mathfrak g $ are quotients of the unique simply connected Lie group $ \bar G$ with $ \mathcal {Lie} (\bar G) = \mathfrak g $, by some central discrete subgroup. It seems to follow from these remarks that the center $ Z=Z(\bar G) $ is an invariant of $ \mathfrak g $. If $G$ is semisimple this center is discrete abelian group. So my question is - how can we determine $Z$ given a semi-simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ ? This seems like a rather basic question but I don't how to answer it. I will be happy to hear an explanation or to have a reference to some standard text.",[],False
2549076,"Cookies disabled in Safari, Wireshark still shows them?","I'm working on implementing a token authorization system provided by a CDN that protects access to HTTP Live Streaming video content. A token is generated by the player and appended as a query string in the request to the CDN. The CDN validates that token and creates another one, passing it back in a Cookie with the initial response. Then each subsequent request from the HLS player to the CDN has that Cookie in the request header. What's confusing me is that when I completely disabled cookies in Safari, the token authorization still works. I was under the impression that with all Cookies disabled, the protection method would not work and I would not be able to view the video. I ran Wireshark and examined the HTTP requests for everything related to the video stream. The cookies are indeed present! Am I missing something obvious about how Cookies work?",[],False

2558765,Android: onClick Between Views and utilizing Asynctask,"My project that I've spent almost 40hrs on is almost complete, but I have one last task to accomplish. My previous problem what that when users clicked to pull up a news RSS feed that app would sometimes hang because it both tried to load the activity and the feed at the same time. This was resolved with asynctask. Now along with this, I have four buttons that switch between different feeds and essentially just modifying the view. This eliminates reloading the screen or new activity. Well, when I initially fire up this activity, the asynctask works exactly like I want, but it's not as simple as copying pasting to each of the different views at the bottom. How do I implement asynctask under each of those different buttons/views. You'll see the onClick at the bottom. Here is the asynctask section. And below here is the onClick section. Obviously with the above i have each readRss, preReadRSS, etc...in the right places in the initial activity, but why won't Java allow me to place these same asynctask tasks in the onClick section?

2638862,FlowDocument loses ClearType in child elements when placed in window with custom glass,"So the new WPF 4 text rendering looks great, but enabling the aero glass effect on a window requires that you change the background to transparent, which of course disables ClearType rendering. Using the provided RenderOptions.ClearTypeHint=Enabled allows you to designate child elements to reenable ClearType rendering from that point in the tree. I've found a few other topics that talk about doing this for the ScrollViewer used internally inside RichTextBox and FlowDocumentScrollViewer, and creating a custom style does indeed fix it so that my FlowDocument gets ClearType rendering again. However, this only applies to top level paragraphs in the FlowDocument. If I add floaters or figures, or a table, any text inside them is inexplicably grayscale again. I know that the glass effect is to blame, since disabling it reenables the ClearType rendering. I looked through the visual tree with Snoop, but both the main content (which renders properly) and the sub-content (which is grayscale) have similar element hierarchies without anything to which I can attach RenderOptions.ClearTypeHint.

Or is windbg just giving me bogus data. Edit* This was caused by a classic buffer overflow in unmanaged code. An array pointer was loaded into a register and then a loop took care of the rest overwriting all of my stack variables, which made it look like the code was in a different state than it was when it crashed.

2653880,How to sort list items using custom sort order in jQuery,"My question is very similar to a number of others I've found on Stack Overflow, but not quite the same. I'd like to sort list items based on the content of a span contained within each item -- but using a sort order that I can define.

The order, obviously, needs to be: Freshman Sophomore Junior Senior How can I do this? Just for reference, I'm using the following jQuery code (which works perfectly) to sort alphabetically by last name:","['&lt;li&gt;\n    &lt;span class=""fname""&gt;John&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;span class=""lname""&gt;Doe&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;span class=""year""&gt;Sophomore&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n', ""function sortByLastName(){\n    var myList = $('#foo ul');\n    var listItems = myList.children('li').get();\n    listItems.sort(function(a,b){\n        var compA = $(a).find('.lname').text().toUpperCase();\n        var compB = $(b).find('.lname').text().toUpperCase();\n        return (compA &lt; compB) ? -1 : (compA &gt; compB) ? 1 : 0;\n    });\n    $(myList).append(listItems);\n};\n""]",False

2657733,Recommended DI solution for bundles used inside and outside of OSGi,"We use a mixed OSGi and non-OSGi environment. Therefore all our produced JARs are Bundles, to enable deployment and runtime both inside and outside of the OSGi container. Therefore, all our are written without any OSGi API integration, and we use a single OSGi extender bundle to register all services as OSGi services. I would like to use a single DI solution (i.e. the same configuration file(s)) when wiring the system together both inside and outside of the OSGi container. This, rather effectively, prevents me from using simple blueprint DI. What would you recommend here? Is there any best practices collected for this kind of scenario?",[],False
2661434,"Game of Life in Java, Overpopulation but can't figure out why","This is homework. I included relevant code at the bottom. Problem: In an attempted to allow the user to resize the grid, the grid is now being drawn severely overpopuated. Screen Shots: ""Overpopulation"" - http://i.imgur.com/zshAC6n.png ""Desired Population"" - http://i.imgur.com/5Rf6P42.png Background: It's a version of Conway's Game of Life. In class we completed 3 classes: LifeState which handles the game logic, LifePanel which is a JPanel that contains the game, and a driver that created a JFrame and added the LifePanel. The assignment was to develop it into a full GUI application with various requirements. My solution was to extend JFrame and do most of my work in that class. Initializing the LifePanel outside of the actionlistener yields normal population, but intializing the LifePanel in the actionlistener ""overpopulates"" the grid. Question: Why is the overpopulation occurring? LifePanel class LifeFrame class Thanks for reading all this, and in advance for any help/advice you offer.

I followed a tutorial that said to use Helios, but said nothing about what not to include (like WTP which I ordinarily use in my work).

2870789,Is there a lightweight standalone SOAP server? Or how would you implement one?,"The challenge here is that I need to implement a highly concurrent and dynamic system that is based on SOAP communication - in Java. It can be viewed as a multi-agent system where an agent is a software process (like a daemon) that responds to SOAP requests. At runtime my system may comprise more than a thousand of such agents - each of which bound to its own dedicated port, offering the exact same service/interface. Thus, implementing it as a Tomcat servlet or similar is a way to heavy. For my first try I built a simple HTTP-Server and tried to implement SOAP message handling on top. But I didn't want to re-invent the wheel, especially since that Simple Object Access Protocol is actually not that simple. Unfortunately, most solutions for Java are based on Jax-WS and require a tomcat or other server environment to run (as far as I understood). Then I had a look at the axis library (awesome). It even comes with a SimpleAxisServer module which does exactly what I want. It runs as a very light-weight standalone SOAP server, and deploying a SOAP service is done very easily. But... here comes the problem: The SimpleAxisServer is meant for development and debugging purposes only and it is highly discouraged to use it otherwise. Of course, me ignoring those hints started prototyping the system using that module, and ran right into trouble after a few days... My actual question now is: Isn't there a ready-made solution for this problem? Which libraries/classes should I have a look at?",[],False
2870863,How does limiting a laptop battery's full charge to less than 100% extend its battery life?,"My laptop lets me limit how much of the battery will charge before reaching full charge: At first, I understand what the intent is. I know that overcharging a battery will result in degradation of its charge capacity. However, with smart chargers these days detecting a full charge and turning charging off when reaching a full charge, wouldn't this mean that overcharging is impossible? Furthermore, my laptop appears to be able to do this (as indicated in the screenshot below). Therefore, am I getting any benefit to having it turn charging off at 80% or 50% capacity, rather than letting it charge to 100%? My thought is that perhaps those settings are more useful when the battery is already degraded. Let's say it can only hold 90% of its original charge. Would the laptop try charging it to 100% even when after 90% it cannot hold any more? Perhaps these limits are more useful, then, to drop the full charge limit so that overcharging doesn't happen and further degrade the battery even more quickly?

Based on user input, the app creates a clipping path around a certain part of the image. I then want to be able to save that clipped version to the app's Documents directory so that it can be shown at a later time. As far as I can tell, all of that is going smoothly except showing the clipped image at a later time. As soon as I try showing the image (by adding a custom view), I get a variety of errors, as well as a . While I'm not sure what's causing the last one, it's the ones that I'm most concerned about because the concept of a graphics context is not something I'm at all comfortable with. Here are the exact errors: At this point, I'm going to post the code that creates the clipping path, then the code that attempts to save the context with the clipped image as a new image, and finally the code that is trying to show the image again.

2988016,counting the number of subsets defined by a partition,"let $\nu=(\nu_1,\cdots,\nu_k)$ be a partition of $n$. to $\nu$ corresponds $\alpha=(\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_n)$ where $\alpha_i$ is the number of $i$ in $\nu$ for example to $\nu=(112)$ a partition of $4$ corresponds $\alpha=(2,1,0,0)$. obviously $\sum{i\alpha_i=n}$. Now my problem is the following. Consider a set $X$ with a distinguished point $*$. fix $n$ and $\alpha=(\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_n)$ and suppose that $*$ is one of the $\alpha_i$ elements that repeats $i$ times. I want to count all the possible subsets of $X^n$ defined by this $\alpha=(\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_n)$ and this multiplicity $i$ of $*$. Things will be more clear with the following example. take $n=4$. we have $5$ partitions $\nu$ and then $5$ corresponding $\alpha$. $\nu=(1,1,1,1)$ so $\alpha=(4,0,0,0)$ here $*$ must be one of the $4$ elements of multiplicity $1$ and so there are 4 subsets of $X^4$ and these are : $(*,x_1,x_2,x_3),(x_1,*,x_2,x_3),(x_1,x_2,*,x_3),(x_1,x_2,x_3,*)$ here of course by $(*,x_1,x_2,x_3)$ we mean the subspace $\{(*,x_1,x_2,x_3)\;|\; x_1,x_2,x_3\in X\}$ and so on.. So here the answer is 4. $\nu=(1,1,2)$ so $\alpha=(2,1,0,0)$ and here there are two cases : Case 1. $*$ is one of the two elements of multiplicity $1$.

3018184,Compare PDF Content With Ruby,"I am in the process of writing a Ruby script/app that helps me compiling LaTeX to (at least) PDF. One feature I want it to have is that it should run iteratively until the PDF converges (as it should, I guess). The idea is to compare the PDF generated in one iteration against the one from the former iteration using their fingerprints. In particular, I currently use . The problem now is that this never converges. A (The, hopefully) culprit is the PDF's timestamp that is set to the seconds at least by . Since runs of take typically longer than one second, the result keeps changing. That is, I expect the PDF's to be equal up to the timestamp(s) after some point. This assumption might be wrong; hints appreciated. What can I do about this? My basic ideas so far: Use a library capable of doing the job Strip meta data away and only hash PDF content Overwrite timestamps by a fixed value before comparing Do you have more ideas or even solutions? Solutions should only use free software that runs on Linux. Such that only use Ruby are preferred, but using external software is perfectly acceptable. By the way, I do not exactly know how PDF is encoded but I suspect that merely comparing the contained text won't work for me since only graphics or links might change in later iterations.

I just typed in the name of the website to see what pages would be indexed and it is only showing the age verification pages. From the googling I've done, apparently nothing behind the age verification will be visible to the google bots because they ignore cookies. Is there no safe workaround for this? I checked out New Belgium's site, which uses a similar age verification link, and all of it's pages seem to be getting indexed. Once you click on one of it's links from google, it redirects the user to the age verification page. Are they not using cookies? Or how might they be getting around the cookie bot issue.",[],False

3054592,WebRequest fails to download large files (~ 1 GB) properly,"I am attempting to download a large file from a public URL. It seemed to work fine at first but 1 / 10 computers seem to timeout. My initial attempt was to use WebClient.DownloadFileAsync but because it would never complete I fell back to using WebRequest.Create and read the response streams directly. My first version of using WebRequest.Create found the same problem as WebClient.DownloadFileAsync. The operation times out and the file does not complete. My next version added retries if the download times out. Here is were it gets weird. The download does eventually finish with 1 retry to finish up the last 7092 bytes. So the file is downloaded with exactly the same size BUT the file is corrupt and differs from the source file. Now I would expect the corruption to be in the last 7092 bytes but this is not the case. Using BeyondCompare I have found that there are 2 chunks of bytes in the missing from the corrupt file totalling up to the missing 7092 bytes! This missing bytes are at 1CA49FF0 and 1E31F380, way way before the download times out and is restarted. What could possibly be going on here? Any hints on how to track down this problem further?

3056010,"In GWT, how well supported are the 2.0 layouts (i.e. LayoutPanel subclasses) in different browsers?","So I'm getting started with GWT and learning how to use the new LayoutPanel stuff, but in the documentation, the 2.0 layouts are guaranteed to work in standards-mode only.

So I'm a bit nervous about how well they currently work across different versions of different browsers. I have created examples to test, but of course the nasty bugs will only show up once the layout becomes more complex. So have any of you run into issues or caveats with the GWT 2.0 layouts?

3079320,In a solvable algebraic group all maximal tori are conjugate to each other,"I want to prove the following statement: All maximal tori in a solvable algebraic group are conjugate to each other. I use the following facts: Theorem. Let $G$ be an irreducible solvable algebraic group and $T$ a torus complementary to its unipotent radical $U$. Then any semisimple element of $G$ is conjugate to some element of $T$. Lemma. Any torus has elements which are not contained in any of its proper algebraic subgroups. I call ad-hoc these element ""bagels"". My idea is as follows: Let $t_1 \in T_1$ be a bagel of a maximal torus $T_1$. It is semisimple. Then by Theorem 1 it is conjugate to some element of another torus, say $T_2$. Then $g t_1 g^{-1} \in T_2$. Since $g t_1 g^{-1}$ is also a bagel (I say that it is true because conjugation is an automorphism), then $T_2$ is maximal (since otherwise, if $T_2$ is a subgroup of another torus $T_3$ (i.e. $T_2 \subset T_3$) then $g t_1 g^{-1}$ is not a bagel since it is contained in a proper subgroup of a torus). We then can apply the same argument on bagels of $T_2$ and every other maximal torus. I would like to know rather my argument is valid and if there are any gaps I need to close. Added in Edit: One gap I have found: I need to reduce the case of solvable algebraic group $G$ with maximal torus $T_1$ to a case of irreducible algebraic $H$ with $T$ is complementary to $U(H)$ = unipotent radical of $H$, in order to apply Theorem 1. How do I fix it? I read in some book that if $U$ is the unipotent radical of $G$ then $T$, its complementary torus, is a maximal torus and the group $G$ containing it is irreducible. We also have $G = U \rtimes T$, so I think this close the first gap I mentioned. Added in Edit 2: I think I managed to proved this elementwise. However, I need to prove a stronger result: let $T$ be the maximal torus complementary to the unipotent radical $U$. Then for every other maximal torus, $T'$, there exists $g \in G$ such that $ g T' g^{-1} = T $ (that is, $g$ is global to all the elements of the torus). Added in Edit 3: The globality of the conjugating element follows from that a torus is a group of commuting semisimple matrices and therefore can be simultaniously diagonalized.",[],False

3082636,How do people apply the Lebesgue integration theory?,"This question has puzzled me for a long time. It may be too vague to ask here. I hope I can narrow down the question well so that one can offer some ideas. In a lot of calculus textbooks, there is usually a chapter about ""applications"" after the one for Riemann integral. Students can do a lot of calculations and appreciate the power of Riemann integration --- they solve many problems in physics and geometry. While learning the Lebesgue integral, or more generally, integration on measure space, I cannot appreciate the power of this kind of integration util I learn some modern PDE. One the other hand, I found that there are much much more inequalities when doing Lebesgue integration than equations when applying Riemann integral. Instead of calculating something, people do estimation with the convergence theorems. Here are my questions: How do people apply Lebesgue integration theory? If putting the methods into categories, can I say that it primarily deals with the problems related to convergence? What's the fundamental difference between applying these two different integration techniques? Is there an example such that people solve some problem which may be very hard(but still can be solved) when using Riemann integral but relatively easy with Lebesgue integral?",[],False

For the characteristic projections, parametrise $x\equiv x(t)$ $$\frac{du}{dt}=0, \frac{dx}{dt}=u^2(x,t)$$ The solution is constant along characteristic projectons, with respect to $t$, so I can trace back to the initial curve (usually called $\Gamma$?) setting $x(0)=0$ (am I allowed to do this?) $$x=(u(x,0))^2=\begin{cases} t &amp; x&lt;0 \\ (x-1)^4(2x+1)^2t &amp; 0\leq x\leq 1 \\ 0 &amp; x&gt;1 \end{cases}$$ When I integrated $\frac{dx}{dt}$ I assumed $u^2(x,t)=u_0(x)$, is this the correct thing to do also? The characteristic projections are quite obvious for either side of the interval $[0,1]$ they are simply the family of curves with $\frac{dx}{dt}=1$ on the left and $\frac{dx}{dt}=0$ (vertical) on the right. I am unsure how to draw the projections elsewhere. Next the condition for the blow-up is $t=-\frac{1}{F'(x)}$ where $x=F(x)t$ are the characteristic projections. I think that it is when the second derivative of these projections is such that the curves are concave because then they intersect at some point and behave badly. $F''(x)&gt;0$ for $x\in(0,\frac{1}{2}]$ so to find the first blow-up time I need to find the smallest value for $$t=-\frac{1}{F'(x)}=-\frac{1}{12 (x-1)^3 x (1+2 x)}$$ Differentiate; $\frac{dt}{dx}=\frac{10 x^2-1}{12 (x-1)^4 x^2 (2x+1)^2}$ the extreme value is found to be $x=\frac{1}{\sqrt{10}}\in(0,\frac{1}{2}]$ this gives a value $$t=\frac{25 \left(25+34 \sqrt{10}\right)}{6561}$$ I am then asked to show that the solution blows up for a value which turns out to to be around $t=0.527$, slightly higher than $t=0.505$ (above), so can I say that the solution blows up for a time earlier than this, hence it blows up for $t=0.527$ also? Is there a better way to show that a solution blows up for a given time, $t$?",[],False

So, I would like to know how to call these POST methods from Obj-C, and how you structure the request, bearing in mind that the method being called is expecting a custom class in the WCF service (clearly the Obj-C app doesn't have access to the metadata of the class in advance) Another party is doing the actual Obj-C work, but I am very interested to know how they will interface with the service, not so much the iOS classes used, just how to structure the actual web request.

3271722,Generating random vectors in a n-ring,"I've seen many different approaches to generate a random vector in the ($n-1$)-sphere and in the $n$-ball.

For some weird reason I cannot quite understand this vector is uniformly distributed in the ($n-1$)-sphere. For the inside of the $n$-ball I choose a random uniform $u\sim U(0,1)$ and then multiply $v \cdot \sqrt[n]{u}$. Now I need to generate a uniform n-vector inside an $n$-ring (the volume between two $n$-balls of radio $r_1$ and $r_2$). I did it by generating a $u\sim U(a,b)$ such that $\sqrt[n]{a} = r_1$ and $\sqrt[n]{b} = r_2$, and follow the same approach as before.

However, the problem is that the contents get truncated - that is, if it's a video file it stops after 2 seconds, if it is image file then only the upper part looks correct.

3736333,Dragging GridSplitter causes cell to grow when using Auto height/width,"I am using a GridSplitter to resize a cell in a grid however its behaviour is not what I am expecting and I cannot find a solution. It is a grid of three rows, the first has a row definition set to Auto and contains some elements. The second row has some data in it and has a row definition of * to fill the remaining space. The last row is a status bar that needs to be resizable, and so has a grid splitter in it and a row definition height of Auto and MinHeight of 30. The problem is when you drag the GridSplitter all the way to the top, it will make the cell overflow. I wish for it to STOP once it gets to the top. The desired behaviour can be achieved by removing the Height=Auto from the last row, but that makes the bottom cell expand to equal height with the middle row. Here is a XAML Pad example. When you drag to the top, you will notice the bottom text disappears. I have tried various things, such as putting the grid splitter in its own cell, and Binding Height to another objects ActualHeight etc but none really work that well. I know it isn't the most well explained question, but any ideas would be greatly appreciated. Edit: I have made the GridSplitter with its own row as posted below, but as I mentioned earlier the problem still remains. I have the ResizeBehavior and ResizeDirection also set here.

3897900,Using Sessions throughout a website,I've started looking at re-writing some pages on a clients website and I can see that for example as soon as somebody logs in there are 53 Sessions variables set. To me this seems crazy to set everything as soon as you login and then throughout the website either refer back to these sessions or add new ones. More often than not their site receives errors because one of the many Sessions has lost its value. So my question is what is the best way of re-doing these pages. Is it a good idea to continue using this amount of Sessions? Is there a better alternative of using the Sessions? There are some variables that are needed on ALL pages on the site so is it better to retrieve these from the Database on each page or set these in a Session? I believe that there should only be one Session needed and that is the USERNAME/USER-ID and everything else should be grabbed from the database as and when it is needed. Thanks in advance,[],False
3899445,Foreign key in SQL Server,"I want to know the use of foreign key in SQL Server as I had a debate with one of my colleagues. I have the opinion, when two tables are connected via a foreign key, when the records are deleted from the parent table then the same reference record from the child table should also get deleted. Say for example I have two tables, Table1 and Table2. Table1 has one record with id = 1 and Table2 has two records with id = 1. Table2 is a child table and connected with Table1 via a foreign key. Now when I try to delete the id = 1 record from Table1 then id = 1 (2 records) should be deleted from Table2 at the same time. He says that's wrong. In case of a foreign key, I have to separately delete records from both the tables. Who is correct?",[],False

They already have things working to some degree and its my job to clean things up and get it working properly as well as using lupdate to keep things in sync when they change etc. We are also using QML in which we wrote a wrapper function for all our strings, so lupdate does not find our function to add to the .ts XML file. The reason we use a wrapper is for centralizing other functions at once place for all strings. We also dont always use a string literal in our 'source' argument but a defined property, such as: property string buttonTxt: ""ButtonText"" then: commonTRFunction(context, buttonTxt) which of course lupdate does not find for both reasons. Ive looked into updating the lupdate source very briefly and Im not sure if its worth trying to hack it to find our function or write our own parser to find the standard QT tags AND also our new ones? Secondly, and related to the first part, Id like a way to make one context section that contains all the common words we use in our app such as 'Back', 'Save', 'Ok' etc etc without repeating it over and over throughout the .ts file. lupdate seems to repeat things over and over in multiple contexts which seems both inefficient and a waste of lines in the ts file. I havent found any QT docs that really explain the differences between tr(), qsTr(), qsTranslate(), QT_TR_NOOP() and QT_TRANSLATE_NOOP(). I know you sometimes need a context and the source, and other times just use the source without a context. We dont use the disambigous arg. Most of our code is in QML and not C++. Also we are running lupdate from the command line. Does anyone have thoughts, suggestions or even a tool someone wrote that can be used for what we have? I appreciate your help.",[],False

When the request reaches the login script page, it checks to see if that IP address has tried to make a login in the last 1 minute. This should at least prove that the login details came from the login page. I know I can't stop it but I would like to make it difficult.

In a get operation, if the entry is not available locally, the remote cache will be used and and the entry is added to local cache.

What's a simplest way to achieve this if you implemented it yourself, assuming that nodes are not aware of each other. Edit My current implementation goes like this: Each cache entry contains a time stamp. Put operation will update local cache and remote cache Get operation will try local cache then remote cache A background thread on each node will check remote cache periodically for each entry in local cache. If the timestamp on remote is newer overwrite the local. If entry is not found in remote, delete it from local.",[],False

In the program I'm working on, I have a UserControl with a few buttons on it, which need to control the navigation of the main window. I have 3 different ""pages"" I want to be able to switch between in my main window. Instead of pages, I decided (for whatever reason, correct me if this is not the best approach) to use a UserControl for each page, and switch the visibility to the correct one. I need the data to persist while switching, so I don't believe that creating new instances of the Usercontrols will work. My question is: How can I bubble the events from my ""NavBarView"" to the main window in a way that will allow me to switch the visibility, but in a MVVM way?

4254007,URL Rewrite Regular Expression to suit all,"Brief Explanation I am trying to come up with a smart way of controlling my web page rewrites with as few rewrites as possible. So, for example, if you have the following page translations: You could have individual rewrites for every page... However, I like to minimise this by instead having one regular expression to suit all. So the regular expression to match the above would be: and then the matches would be placed into the URL like so (note that would be replaced by on the errors page): and then you could append the query string... Obviously in some cases you need individual rewrites, but you can usually minimise this by using clever regular expressions and well structured pages. My Problem Similar to the above example, I have pages within my site that are rewritten with this exact regular expression. So the following pages translate like so: However, for reasons which I will not go into, I also have pages written like so: Notice the it says shipment not shipments! Despite this, I still want this to be rewritten to the shipments page. So the translation would look like this: I cannot think of a way other than another rewrite that specifies that shipment is an alias for shipments... One of the reasons I do not want individual rewrites for this is that I am not just talking about shipments, there are many documents that I need to alias, and therefore would rather not go down the multiple rewrite route as my web.config file will get pretty darn large. I have come up with the following solutions (but obviously I am not happy with them): Have a page in my root directory called shipment.php and just include the contents of shipments.php Write rewrites for each page with an alias...

This would require me to save the login and password in the script, in plaintext. This seems wrong and very insecure - I wonder what is the better way to do this? The webapp needs a sqlite db, which out of the box do not provide any security. How can i ensure that people just cant download the whole database file?

The problem is that as you fade out, the whole window resizes, as it's designed to do, the scroll bar goes and then the new results are displayed. If the new results require a scroll bar then this looks kinda odd as it first disappears then reappears. Is there a purely jQuery way to put off the window resize, and hence keep the scroll bar visible, until the next load of results has been fully shown?

4510073,Consistently order columns from a dsv (text file) where each record has a different column order,"=== Comment regarding closing question ==== While the data in the example is localized the final script will be useful for anyone who has a complex set of xml files to convert to a text database as the process will work on any input xml regardless of the attribution. === New Information ==== I have been able to generate a list of all the tags in the initial process but to then recreate the tag::text pairs is not feasible as it has to run through 1000's of xml's, produce a unique sorted list and then re-read the xml's and start to create the text datasets. So if given the following (or any text with unique delimiters) can I run through and capture the tags? (in this case ^ is the column separator and :: is the tag::text separator) I need it to give me a list of tags like [citeinfo, timeprd, status etc] and then run through and create another dataset which has just the text. I will stress that this is not localized as the solution will work on any xml's that need deconstruction. === Original Question follows I have created a text file by de constructing a number of different xml style documents. I have recorded the tag::text together as each file has the tags in a slightly different order. The key is the name of the original xml file. Is it possible to reconstruct an excel or 'csv' from the data so that all files have the columns properly ordered. An excel sample and raw data is available here. The script I used is here. Thanks, ==== It is to difficult to get a list of tags from the output as you would need to go line by line and search for the tags and if not duplicate add to a list. So I decided that it's easier to generate a tag list while parsing the xml. This worked but I am having issues with telling the script what do when a tag from the ordered list is not found in the xml.

4551725,Aggregate/Extrapolate sparse samples in multi-dimensional space,"Imagine there is a function which evaluates the elevation of a surface given a floating point x and y coordinate (and additional components in accordance with dimensionality): This is not an analytic function and thus the derivatives cannot be computed. What I need to do is find the direction in which the surface is steepest for any given {x, y} pair. A single evaluation could be very expensive (think seconds or even minutes in worst case scenarios). My typical approach in the 2D case would be to sample the surface in N locations adjacent to {x, y}, then fit a curve through those samples and search the curve for the highest point, as this search does not suffer from expensive evaluation: In the above image P0 is the given coordinate. {S0, S1, S2, S3} are 4 random-ishly placed samples around P0 and PM is the highest point on the curve. Thus, the vector PM-P0 is the direction of steepest ascent. But I have no idea how to scale this up to N dimensions, or whether there are much smarter algorithms for doing this. The number of dimensions is potentially quite large (dozens to hundreds), so whatever method I end up using must work when there are fewer samples than there are dimensions. I'm not looking for the exact answer, that would be impossible, but a half-way decent approximation would already be most welcome. ps.

4618927,Is there a standard pattern for avoiding latency in a job queue due to a single blocked task?,"I have a basic queue of tasks executing (c# WinForms App that talks to 3 separate systems). Everything is great until one of the web services decides not to respond in with the usual speed. I'm not interested in speeding things up via multi threading the jobs, but now that I am using it in production, I can see the benefit of having at least two threads running jobs - if one blocks and it's an anomaly, the other will keep truckin', and if both block, then probably any number of threads would and I just deal with it. So, the question is: is this a common pattern I just described, and is there a name for that pattern and/or some awesome reference or framework, or anything to help me not re-invent any wheels. Additions based on Comments/Answers The tasks can be run simultaneously. I have chosen not to peruse a multi-threaded design for the purposes of speed, but I am now considering it to attain consistent performance in the face of infrequent task latency. My assumption is that every once in a while a call to a web service takes disproportionately longer to complete while still being considered non-exceptional. This has a NON(corrected)-negligible impact on the total run time of, say, N jobs, if the average execution time is 1 second (including a host of disparate web service calls) and 0.0001% of the time a web service takes 15 seconds to respond. Is a thread pool just another way of saying, ""spin up worker threads and manage their state manually"" ? Or is there something that can help me manage the complexity? I worry that the chance of introducing bug(s) grows out of proportion to the benefits in this case... I think I am looking for something similar to a thread pool, but one that only spins up additional threads when latency is detected. If anyone can give me more info on what one of the comments refers to as a work-stealing thread, that sounds promising.

4632837,SOAP::Lite takes filedescriptor but doesn't release it,I'm calling a .net webservice from Linux using Perl (5.8.7). I'm using the SOAP::Lite library. The basic proof of concept worked fine and now I'm trying it in the real world where I have to call the webservice many times. Now it looks like the web service call opens a file but does not release the file descriptor. The default maximum number of available is set to 256 and it suns out of that quickly after which the program dies. :( Here's the code: If I monitor the file descriptors used with ls -l /proc/$$/fd | wc -l I notice the number of used filedescriptors to go up every time I make a web service call. Any help or hint would be appreciated.,"['# Create the soap client\nmy $client = SOAP::Lite-&gt;new;\n\n# Get raw SOAP xml output\n$client-&gt;outputxml(1);\n\n# Set connection parameters\n$client-&gt;uri($namespace);\n\n# set the url in the proxy member.

4698725,Excel tries to open file for download in IE,"I have somewhat of an obscure problem, but I will try my best to explain. We have URLs mapped using SpringMVC so that when a POST request is made, a download can be triggered. For example, a request of will trigger a download of a CSV file related to id 5. The issue is that in IE, doing this gives you the option of Open or Save As. Choosing Open will open the CSV file as intended in MS Excel, but the temporary file will be named bobby.html. When the user leaves Excel open and tries to load another id (say, 6), focus will change to Excel, but since the request still points at bobby.html, the file is not refreshed. You have to close the file in Excel before a new one of the same name can take its place, but there is no message to tell the user to close the old file. Ideally, I want the file name to change, but the Spring servlet being used is mapped specifically to *.html files only because we have other applications running in the same container with other extensions. I have tried adding a UUID onto the request just to make it look different to Excel/IE, and it worked to some extent... made it look different to IE, but Excel still kept the base request as the file name. This allowed for a warning, but telling the user that their file name is ""bobby.html"" and they can't open another one might be more confusing than no warning at all. I also tried to add on something at the end: Any idea how to make this work? I know this type of thing is doable in SpringMVC, but with the servlet mappings is there a way to make it work?

I've read a lot of tutorials and got the basics working but now I'm stuck since things are getting more complicated. My framework uses the following URL structure: /controller/action. Optionally followed by an inifinite number of variables, e.g. /product/view/1. So far I got two separate controllers: page and product. I wan't to include them both in a single menu. I'm trying to establish the following menu structure. The corrosponding URL is between brackets. Our company (/page/view/2) Werkwijze (/page/view/3) Staff (/page/view/4) Our products (/product/index) Bread (/product/category/1) Banket (/product/category/2) Cake (/product/category/3) Contact (/page/view/5) So basically I got a main menu and a sub menu. There are a few requirements I defined for the menu class: The current item should have a different CSS class in the menu. If the current item has a parent than that should have a different CSS class as well. The menu should be expandable using all kinds of content a URL's. And for bonus points: when I select a product from the Bread category. Let's say /product/view/1; then I'd like the 'Our products' and 'Bread' menu items to be highlighted as well.

Each list item is initially set with . My goal is to make it so if the user uploads a a required document (one that is already on the list) it changes the list item to . However, if they upload a non-required document (one that is not on the list), it appends that document to the end of the list. The name of the document is passed in the variable from the upload form. How would I go about this? Is there a way to check if the item already exists in the list?

4999492,Obtaining Read/Write Lock for Sqlite Parallel Updates,"I write a lot of parallel scripts in python for research purposes and was wondering if it is possible to obtain a read/write lock manually in sqlite for a specific set of commands.

To do so, I run 10 instances of a program that counts rows for a certain range of A and adds the sum of the rows to the property in B. The problem is that I need to read the property in B, add it to the instance's count, and save it; all while making sure none of the other instances are doing this process. Normally it is only a write lock that is needed - in this case I need a read lock as well... I was hoping I could do something like this: 1) read/write lock 2) Grab current value in B, add it to the instance count 3) save new value 4) unlock Is there a way to do this? Thanks.",[],True
4999943,How can I store and index a list in a relational database?,"I'm working on constructing a database (SQLite) to store information about each run of a Mathematica script I've written. The script takes several input parameters, so my DB has a table with a column for each parameter (among other columns). Some of the input parameters are lists of numbers. My first thought for storing these is to use a junction table as described in the accepted answer to this question. But I typically use the same list for several different runs. How can I look up whether any given list is already in the database, so I can reuse its ID rather than storing it again? Constraints as mentioned in comments: There is no explicit upper bound on the length of a list but in practice it ranges from 1 to about 50. The number of distinct lists will be small, on the order of 10. I actually have 3 list parameters. For two of them, the values in the list are non-negative, double precision floating point numbers; for the third, the values are pairs of such numbers. There are no duplicate entries. (These are more precisely sets, so no duplicates and order is irrelevant) I can easily arrange for the list elements to be in sorted order. For example: suppose my table is set up like this When I run the script, it sets the parameters and then calls a function to run the calculation, like so: Assuming this is the very first run of the script, it will insert the following contents into the DB: So far, so good. Now let's say I run the script again with one different parameter, In a naive implementation, this will result in the database containing this: But I would like it to be able to look up the fact that the list is already in the database, so that after the second run the DB contains this instead: What sort of a query can I use to find that the list already exists in the table ? I'm not opposed to creating additional tables if necessary. Or if there is some model other than using a junction table that makes more sense, that's fine too.","['CREATE TABLE jobs (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, param1 REAL, param2_id INTEGER);\nCREATE TABLE param2 (param2_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, value REAL);\n', 'param1 = 4;\nparam2 = {.1, .3, .5};\nrunTheCalculation[param1, param2]\n', 'jobs:   id      param1     param2_id\n         1       4.0        1\n\nparam2: param2_id   value\n         1           0.1\n         1           0.3\n         1           0.5\n', 'param1 = 2;\nparam2 = {.1, .3, .5};\nrunTheCalculation[]\n', 'jobs:   id      param1     param2_id\n         1       4.0        1\n         2       2.0        2\n\nparam2: param2_id   value\n         1           0.1\n         1           0.3\n         1           0.5\n         2           0.1\n         2           0.3\n         2           0.5\n', '{.1, .3, .5}', 'jobs:   id      param1     param2_id\n         1       4.0        1\n         2       2.0        1\n\nparam2: param2_id   value\n         1           0.1\n         1           0.3\n         1           0.5\n', '{.1, .3, .5}', 'param2']",True

I'll typically have a dialog box that among other controls will have two combo boxes: one to select a data table among existing tables, and one to select a column among the columns in the currently selected table. This is easy enough so far, but since this is a dialog, I need to show the values that were selected the last time the dialog was shown if they still exist in the database, or otherwise select some other column if the table still exists, or select another table and column if there is any table and warn the user that his selection has changed, or if there are no tables simply show a message and close the dialog. Of course this is not the only case. Sometimes it will be a bit more complex and every time I will try to figure out again what's the best way to handle it.

5436004,How does the ARC's zeroing weak pointer behavior implemented?,"I'm studying ARC. And now about zeroing weak pointer. OK I understood all the features. The semantic of weak reference is just same with weak reference of GC system, but you know, Objective-C doesn't use GC (except special case) so I can't understand how does this work. I'm a little complicated guy, so I need to know underlying implementation principal to accept the feature to use. But the problem is it's very hard to find document which describes the principal of zeroing-weak pointer :( IMO, the only way to make this work is tracking and keeping all pointers referencing itself at runtime, and setting them all when its referencing count becomes . But this looks too heavy and stupid. I believe a lot better solution used in actual ARC implementation. Can you help me to find the documentation? Or direct description would be more great!","['nil', '0']",False

If the appropriate cookies are not found, the page defaults to showing the form. Above the I have the following code which looks for the cookies and sets a variable to display the correct page Following that there is the logic that checks and processes the form. If everything is correct, it will set the 2 cookies and set the variable to The code is being run in a subdirectory, so from my understanding using the path should make the cookie visible to the entire site. should set a cookie with the same name and value, which should expire when the browser is closed. should set a cookie with the same name and value and should expire in 1 month. This is all before the element, and no errors are thrown when the cookies are being set. In the page there is a simple php statement which checks the variable to see which state to display.

5464400,How can I prevent an iFrame from stealing focus [advanced]?,"I am working on a site that loads an iframe (from another domain) as a user types into a textbox. Sometimes, the iframe loads a site that will steal the focus. This is particularly annoying, as the user will have been typing in my textbox, and now will be typing into the iframe's textbox. It seems there's no way to disable an iframe from stealing focus. To mitigate this, I'm trying to come up with a sensible way to figure out when to refocus my textarea. It's turning out to be quite a headache. The main reason this sucks is because I cannot figure out a way to tell when my textbox has been blurred intentionally, versus when the iframe has stolen focus. Here is as far as I've gotten, but I need some help: Now note how terrible of a UX this is if you want to intentionally stop typing into the text field. While the iframe is loading, you're ""locked"" into the text field... you can't even type into the address bar of your browser. Any ideas on how to improve this? I'm hoping that I'm missing something completely obvious, but I'm pretty sure I'm not.

Best Method for pre-loading?,We have a summary view in our winform app that uses a WebBrowser control to display the summary information from a web page. We are using this to gain some rich tabular layout that we could not accomplish using standard winform controls. the first time the view is displayed on the client it takes a while to spin up (launching IE in the background i assume) and the app freezes for quite a few seconds. I'm considering some sort of pre-loading mechanic that would get IE spun-up in the background and would like some community guidance.

However, my App has some points where a single thread will perform a complex task and sometimes that task uses up enough memory that it is just terminated by the OS (my app can download pictures from the internet, and I scale them down to a small size ... if the user downloads a very large image, my app runs out of memory and just goes 'poof'). Having the App spontaneously terminate is obviously a poor user experience. Is there any way that I can find out when I am about to run out of memory and stop the task instead? I suppose I could put the task on a separate thread, and maybe the system would send the main thread a low memory warning, but that seems pretty complicated and not even guaranteed to work. Thanks!

In the current project, for the last couple of days, we've been trying to make our pair programming a little better, so we even have a timer now to ensure that the swap between driver and navigator happens often enough. For changing pairs, we tried to do it in several ways. We tried changing at the end of the week, but found it too long. We tried in the middle of the week but we tended to forget, so we decided to do it daily. Problem is that there are some stories that take a couple of days, so it's a little cumbersome to do it this way. Then we changed to a ""per story"" pair changing. But this is just a little uneven because the stories themselves most of the time are uneven as well. So, simple question: How often should you change pairs?",[],False

Now, I want to get as much tweets as possible matching those trending topics for research purposes. Since I would like to study the patterns of the trends, I would like continuous tweet data of at least 3 days centered in the day the trend peak was detected, for every trending topic. In order to achieve that, I thought of doing the following: Suppose I am in day X. I could retrieve the unique trends of day X-2, and for every trend, look for tweets matching the trend in the interval [X-3, X-1], that is 3 days. However, the problem here is Twitter rate limitations. If I have 100 trending topics in day X-2, and I make 20 GET search requests/trend, I would end up doing a total of 2,000 requests, which overpasses Twitter's 350 hourly rate limit. If make 300 req/hour, it would take more than 6 hours to get the data for only one day... Does anybody know any other (better) way for getting tweets associated with trends?

6031989,ASPNETDB login page won't load,"having a problem with a new ASP NET app and ASPNETDB Installed on existing server which already has a similar app which happily uses ASPNET DB for membership etc. Config etc very similar. The login page is identical to the one in the other app which works fine. App runs under NETWORK SERVICE as does the other one. Used a nifty little app http://sourceforge.net/projects/aspnetdb/ to add the new app and the admin user to the existing ASPNETDB. Had a look at the entries in the ASPNETDB for the new app, roles, user - all good. App looks fine until you try to navigate to the page with the asp:Login control. Progress bar slowly grows - for hours apparently - but doesn't leave the calling page. No errors, no timeouts. Had a look at the database Activity Monitor. Shows a process attached to the ASPNETDB which seems to be churning continuously. Kill it and the page navigation completes but with an error about process not being available. The other app has a similar process which only seems to fire once when navigating to the login page. Any ideas? Setup is Windows Server 2003 standard edition, .NET Framework 2.0.50727.3603, SQL Server 2005 Standard edition 9.00.3042.00 Thanks, Geoff",[],False
