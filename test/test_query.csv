1,How to check if an uploaded file is an image without mime type?,"<p>I'd like to check if an uploaded file is an image file (e.g png, jpg, jpeg, gif, bmp) or another file. The problem is that I'm using Uploadify to upload the files, which changes the mime type and gives a 'text/octal' or something as the mime type, no matter which file type you upload.</p>

<p>Is there a way to check if the uploaded file is an image apart from checking the file extension using PHP?</p>

8,How to fetch an XML feed using asp.net,"<p>I've decided to convert a Windows Phone 7 app that fetches an XML feed and then parses it to an asp.net web app, using Visual Web Developer Express. I figure since the code already works for WP7, it should be a matter of mostly copying and pasting it for the C# code behind. </p>

<pre><code>HttpWebRequest request = HttpWebRequest.CreateHttp(""http://webservices.nextbus.com/service/publicXMLFeed?command=routeConfig&amp;a=sf-muni&amp;r="" + line1);
</code></pre>

<p>That's the first line of code from my WP7 app that fetches the XML feed, but I can't even get HttpWebRequest to work in Visual Web Developer like that. Intellisense shows a create and createdefault, but no CreateHttp like there was in Windows Phone 7. I just need to figure out how to fetch the page, I assume the parsing will be the same as on my phone app. Any help?</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
